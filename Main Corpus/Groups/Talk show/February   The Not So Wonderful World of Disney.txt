  You are listening to It is BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I am Sam Sanders. My guest today has a pretty famous last name.  But I have a very foggy memory - I think I must have been 5 or 6 years old - of riding in the first boat the day they opened up the small world ride next to my grandfather and holding his hands.  That is filmmaker and activist Abigail Disney - yeah Disney - which would make her grandfather Roy O. Disney the co-founder of the Walt Disney Company and older brother of Walt Disney. Abigail's dad was Roy E. Disney.  So I have this actually kind of formative memory. I am convinced it is why I love going to the U.N. because it is like grown-up small world right?   It is like national dress. And it is just so exciting. But I remember that so well because my grandfather loved that ride incredibly. And so I love it incredibly. And it is just every aspiration of mine in life you know that we can all get along.  Despite Abigail's family history she is actually not a fan of the Disney we all know. Back in 2019 Abigail wrote this op-ed in The Washington Post calling out then-CEO Bob Iger. She thought it was unfair that Iger took home 65 million in pay in just one year. Since then Abigail Disney has become one of Disney's most vocal and prominent critics. She is lobbied for a reduction in executive pay. She is pushed for increased wages for Disney's low-income workers. She is asking for Disney to become a different kind of company. And her mission feels especially acute during this pandemic as Disney has had to furlough and lay off tens of thousands of its workers. So today on the show we are going to dive deep into Disney with a Disney and how Abigail thinks the company and really all of corporate America should change. Just a note before we start the Walt Disney Company is a sponsor of NPR. All right. With that before we get into everything I wanted to ask Abigail Disney why she chose to speak out in the first place.  It is a hard thing. And it was a hard thing - you know I am 61 years old. I have not really done this publicly about Disney specifically until recently because...  Yeah.  ...It was that hard to choose to go against my last name like that...  Yeah.  ...Because yeah there is so much love there. I mean it was a place - I mean yes it was motivated by profits. It was motivated by you know a very narrow sense of American life and history that left a lot of people out and actively injured others. So I...  But it was also a place of joy...  But it is a...  ...I remember going as a kid loving it.  Exactly. Exactly. And that is the part I am trying to get to which is I stand there in front of those gates at that park. And I watch those families go in. And I just think how can you not see this as a social good? This is a valuable thing. This is an American thing.  Yeah. Yeah.  And if it did not exist we would be poorer for it.  What was the moment it all shifted for you? From that first happy Disney moment to where you are now was there a time an event a thing that began to shift your perspective on Disney?  That is hard because you know when things are complicated a single epiphany is never really enough right?  Yeah yeah.  You need lots and lots of epiphanies. And they build on each other. But I know that when I went to New York City to start graduate school it was the height of the homelessness crisis in the '80s. Reagan was in office.  What year? OK. Yeah.  Yeah. And you know New York City you know you cannot dodge reality. So homelessness kind of smacked me in the face when I got to New York. And I was just amazed at how comfortable everybody was with it. So that is when I started to sort of break off from the idea that that had nothing to do with me. And then you know I spent a lot of time in graduate school as one will when one's  getting a Ph.D.   Yeah.  And so I was there for when there was talk of building a history theme park - I do not know if you remember any of that - in the '90s. And the academics went crazy. You know let Disney have its go at American history? Oh no thank you.  .  And so - like here I am in academia. But my last name is like you know literally poison. And...  Yeah.  ...It made me ask myself like whose team do I want to be on? And you know if you pay attention when you go to the Hall of Presidents if you look around Jungleland and all the other kinds of awfulness that is - just the Song Of The South alone is enough of a reason to know that there is a terrible legacy of racial injustice. And this is not a question of looking the other way. The Song Of The South was not a question of looking the other way. This was a question of actively harming people.  So hearing you coming to that realization about some of the uglier truths of Disney was there also a moment where just like the money you began to see it differently? I was reading that you had said before that when you went to college your parents were well-off but like not crazy extravagant. But then during the Michael Eisner era of Disney...  Yeah.  ...They just got really rich and everything changed?  Yeah. I mean everything changed. You know I have always - I have a credit card. My last name is Disney. So I give people my credit card and they react to my last name nine times out of 10.  Yeah.  And all my life up until the '90s the reaction was this oh how nice for you. Your family has created so much joy. Are not you lucky? Is not that wonderful? And then like is Walt Disney in your freezer at home? And do you know Mickey Mouse? - and jokes like that.  .  So that was pretty the regular thing. And I thought I hated that. But what I hated was what came in the '90s which was you must be so wealthy. And I brought this to the attention of Michael Eisner the CEO at the time and others. And I talked to my father about it. I was like you are going to kill this brand. There is no way the brand can survive this. And when people react to my last name on my credit card you better bet that is a brand reaction.  What was Michael Eisner doing that changed Disney and made it you know moneybags?  Right right right. Well I - you know I think of him as the gateway CEO because the business community in the United States has been in transition for 50 years you know from one kind of place to the place it is now. So in the '90s it was even a slightly less poisonous version of what we are dealing with today. But at the time Michael was CEO. Of course he was you know - there was so much when he came in as CEO that had not been done. The company was wildly undervalued on the stock market because it was being very poorly run. So you know they released the videotapes. I mean you know they had not released any of the classic films on videotape. Can you imagine just that in terms of revenues in turning the company around? So of course the company started making hit after hit. The animation department was completely you know revivified and everything was going great. That was not so terrible an association people had but they were starting to see not love and family. They were starting to see oh big bucks. And part of that was because what was getting reported in the business media about how well the company was doing. Part of that was the way Michael and others were rewarding themselves. And he was famous at the time for being sort of the poster child of really egregious executive compensation.  I remember back in the '90s hearing how much money he was making and it was the first time that I was like thinking about Disney and not just thinking about Mickey Mouse.  Exactly. Exactly. And so that really put a kind of a smell around everything around the company.  Did not he used to put his face - OK sorry to sidebar you here but I would watch the Disney movies like on Sunday nights and he would like do the intro sometimes.  Yeah yeah he would.  Yeah I remember that. Oh my goodness.  And he was terrible .  Anyways go ahead. Sorry.  He was terrible at it yeah because it just did not - you know Walt was a sort of kind of charming you know warm guy. But yeah so this was a sign that Disney was going to just be a company like every other company. And up until then there was a sort of a belief that Disney could be different. Disney was special. And you know my grandfather sort of was known for taking less money on a deal because it was the right thing to do rather than cashing in for everything he could possibly get from time to time. Or paying more for property sometimes in Florida when he was buying up the land then he really had to because some little old lady was you know going to be kicked off her land and things like that. So choices were made back in those days that other CEOs and other companies made because those were the norms at the time. That was what was expected.   Coming up we take it all back to Milton Friedman.   So I asked Abigail Disney to help unpack the ways that business norms have changed how corporate leadership in the '80s and '90s underwent this ideological shift. And she told me that so much of it goes back to this op-ed written by the influential economist Milton Friedman. It was written in 1970 and published in The New York Times. The title of this op-ed - A Friedman Doctrine The Social Responsibility Of Business Is To Increase Its Profits.   That was the title.  Yeah. What is stunning is how quickly - because consider it is only 1987. So only 17 years after that article that you have Gordon Gekko saying greed is good right? And that is the basis - that is the moral underpinning of the argument that shareholder primacy everybody benefits if every business runs as efficiently as possible and makes as much money as possible. And you have got Gordon Gekko saying greed is good and the audience is cheering. I was in New York. I watched it in the theater. And the audience was cheering as though he was the good guy when he was the villain of the piece.  You know what is - it is interesting to hear you talk about how this concept of shareholder you know primacy came about in the '70s and '80s because what is entirely counter to that and might have existed more before that is the exact opposite something called stakeholder primacy where you think as much about the customers and the employees and the community as you do the shareholders.  Yes and...  I think we forget that that like ever existed.  Yeah. And you know it comes from an almost absolutist material way of understanding the nature of the world right? Because if you take out of business everything that is intangible then you cannot come to any other conclusion that - then that shareholders matter and nothing else does. In order to believe that stakeholders matter that your employees actually have more than just a contractual relationship with you those ideas are based on intangibles - things like morals ethics beliefs and communitarian values. And right now if you talk at all about mutuality what you are dismissed as is a socialist immediately as though there is nothing in between this pure individualism that we are working with now and Marx. There is no - nothing on the you know continuum between those two things.   So fast-forward - we began to see shareholder primacy take precedence over stakeholder primacy in the '70s and '80s. The shift for corporations becomes profit profit profit. Now we are in 2021. You are campaigning for Disney to address that shift. What specifically are you asking Disney to do?  What I want Disney to do is to completely realign its practices from a corporate standpoint around the idea that its employees are not interchangeable cogs in a machine. So there is something called the B Corp. Have you ever heard of the B Corp movement?  No tell me. Tell me.  So you know it is a relatively small movement of businessmen and -women and people in business schools and people who write about business who are trying to figure out how to certify and quantify the value of a business when you include all the values that are not strictly material. So it is more than just what they call ESG which is socially responsible investing. It is putting all the pieces together - like where are you on the environment? And are you really addressing discrimination? And how are you treating your employees? And how are you looking after the long-term interests of the community with your work? And is your product damaging to the people you are selling it to? And all those things. And so people can apply for a B Corp certification. And then there is this neutral third party that goes in and tells you here are the things you have to change if you want to certify as this social benefit corporation. And I would love to see Disney become tomorrow the biggest B Corp in the world. It would be a massive change. It is asking something crazy of them.  Yeah.  And I do not see why we should not ask something crazy of them. Was not it crazy for them to exist in the first place?   Was not Mickey Mouse itself as an idea crazy?  Yes exactly.  Come on. A talking mouse? .  Imagine - Walt said let us buy a bunch of orange groves in that like tiny Podunk town Anaheim and build a crazy imaginary place there.  Yeah.  And people will drive to it and spend money to be there?  Yeah.   I mean all of it was nuts.  Stay with us. Coming up we break down the disparity between the Disney C suite making millions and the low-income Disney employees being laid off. I want to take a second just to dig into the almost absurdity of some of the numbers that we see floating around Disney right now. Can you give us a sense of some of the numbers that show the scale of that disparity right now at Disney?  Yeah. Basically it is like 200000 people are employed by that company. Over 20000 have been laid off.  Wow.  So that is a pretty significant bite out of...  One in 10.  Yeah exactly. And of course you know overrepresented in that 20000 will be the people at the bottom of the pay scale the people who can least accommodate that. The share price is through the roof because as you know the stock market is through the roof in spite of the fact that the company is losing money in spite of the fact that the revenues have been eviscerated because the...  Well they are not putting movies in theaters.  Exactly.  Of course they are losing money - a lot of money yeah.  So it shows you where shareholder primacy takes you and it reinforces the idea that your share price can be totally unrelated to the well-being of the people inside of your company.  Have you talked with low-wage Disney employees since the pandemic hit since the layoffs hit? What are they saying and how are they doing?  Yes I have. And yeah they are terrified. They are really terrified because you know the folks I have talked to have things like asthma and diabetes and all the preexisting conditions that come with A poverty and B higher risk for COVID. So there was real fear that they would be forced to go back to work. And that did not happen in California because Gavin Newsom sort of pushed back on Disney. But of course Ron DeSantis said you know come on in to Orlando. And then there is all the uncertainty. But I mean I know people who work from 11 oclock at night till 7 oclock in the morning and then they go home and they get their kids ready for school and then they clean the house and then they do the shopping and then they sleep for two or three hours have dinner help the homework and go back to work. I mean I would love to see any CEO do that one night...  Wow.  ...And tell me they should not be paid better.  You know when I think about Disney and this image you are painting of Disney that is one side of the company. But there is another side of the company that projects really well.  Yes.  You know Disney like a lot of other corporations has just gotten a lot more woke in the last few years in the last decade or two. And the conversation particularly for entertainment companies like Disney is all right what are you doing about racial equity and gender equity? And they do the thing where you can get prominent women and people of color in prominent positions. Or you can make a movie where the lead is Black. And those things are nice. And they are good. But it sometimes feels as if they are - how can I just be blunt and say it? - distractionary  tactics...  Yeah. Yeah.  ...From like the real dollars and cents of this stuff. How do you feel about that representative work that Disney is doing in the midst of this financial stuff?  The high-profile executive woman I refer to as girl-washing right?  Oh.   Yeah. All you have to know is like go really close to where the money is and ask yourself who is there? And you will know all you need to know about fairness at that company because boy the women and the people of color start to disappear the closer closer you get to the center right? So these are big deep structural problems. And it is great to make the Black Panther. There is no question that was a brilliant piece of...  It changed the culture.  Yes.  It was a cultural reset. Yeah.  It was really important. It was not even just a moment. Most movies are moments. And this was so much bigger than that. But like who is pulling down the 1400 times the median worker's pay? And who is making the decisions about where the capital is allocated and why and how? And then you start to see oh it does get a little whiter and a little maler  the more we work our way into the center of this decision-making body. And this is true at every company in America. That is not just Disney.  So - you know we were talking earlier in this chat about this shift in the corporate mindset from stakeholder primacy to shareholder primacy. And it might allow some listeners to think that there was a time before this stuff got so bad.  When everything was fine .  Yeah.  Yeah yeah.  But that was also a time when people of color and women were totally shut out...  Exactly.  ...From all fair wages and wealth creation.  Exactly.  So in a way...  Yeah.  ...Is what you are asking for now is it something that is actually never happened before a basic financial security...  Yes.  ...For all working Americans regardless of race or gender?  Yeah. The problem with looking back at 1956 or whatever - you know 95 sometimes income tax rate you know and 80-something percent corporate tax rate. And yet companies were thriving and building and doing really well. And arguably a lot of the thriving that was happening then was happening because - for the middle class because the middle class was just white and male.  It was just white. Yeah. Yeah.  I mean the pool of potential employees for any given job was way smaller. And so it was possible to pay everybody better. It was possible to supply health and pensions and all the rest of that. So as the world has gotten - at least attempted to be fairer and more people have joined the workforce who should have always been in it it is gotten harder to accomplish these kinds of things. But while that was happening while Jim Crow was hopefully being addressed and we were trying to do better in employment and housing and all of that companies were also shifting their ethos away from being just. So the society was going one direction. But corporations were going the opposite direction.  Wow.  So we have to be very careful with the temptation to say oh we have to go back to when it was good because it was not good.  Yeah because good for who?  Yeah.  Good for who ?  It was not good you know?  Yeah yeah.  I mean yes my grandfather would never have allowed for a person working for him for a lifetime to retire without a pension. That would have been unthinkable to him. He also did not hire very many Black people or women. And you know he oversaw and funded the making of Song Of The South. So this is bad  unequivocally.  Both things can be true. Yeah yeah.  So yes that is the problem that we need to kind of get to. We need to be able to - and this is true actually up and down and across everything related to our society right now. We need to be able to learn how to take in that this is a bad thing existing at the same time in the same person with this other good thing. And we have to be able to hold those - both things in our heads at the same time. We can - yeah.  Walk and chew gum at the same. Yes. Yeah.  Yeah exactly - and juggle .   Thanks again to Abigail Disney. She is a filmmaker activist and philanthropist. She also hosts the podcast All Ears With Abigail Disney. By the way we reached out to the Walt Disney Company for comment. And they said that after the parks were closed because of the pandemic and before beginning furloughs the company paid full salaries to workers who were unable to perform their duties for five weeks. Disney also told NPR that they kept providing full health care benefits even after the furloughs. When it comes to workers that were laid off Disney told us that they paid severance to the employees and gave them access to outplacement services. In addition the Walt Disney Company told NPR that executives took quote steep salary cuts last year with the CEO forgoing 50 of his salary and the executive chairman forgoing his full salary. Again that was all in a statement given to us from Disney. All right listeners do not forget this Friday we are back in your ear buds with another episode.
