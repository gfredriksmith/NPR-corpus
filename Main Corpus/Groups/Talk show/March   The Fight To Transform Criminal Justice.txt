  You are listening to It is BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I am Ayesha Rascoe in for Sam Sanders. So as a White House correspondent for NPR I spend a lot of time at the White House and I run across a lot of interesting people there to say the least. But one of the people that really stood out to me was Brittany K. Barnett a lawyer working to transform the criminal justice system. In 2018 Brittany was advocating to the White House on behalf of her client Alice Marie Johnson. At the time Alice was a 63-year-old great-grandmother serving a life sentence in prison without parole for a first-time federal drug offense. The only hope the only possibility for Alice's release was through an act of clemency by then President Donald Trump which he did once he heard from someone famous.   I knew I had an attorney call but I still did not know what it was. And when they all came on then I heard Kim Kardashian's voice. And she was the one who told me that I was - that it had happened that I was free that I was going to rejoin my family.  The Kim Kardashian. Kim K. had learned about Alice and advocated directly to President Trump for her release. And Brittany she felt all right about the media attention.  I always kept my focus lasered on Alice's freedom. And I was elated. We were all elated that Kim Kardashian was a part of the team that she was dedicated enough to fly across the country to have this in-person meeting for Alice. I mean it was all remarkable that she was even using her platform for such a critical important issue of our time.  Still pretty much the only thing anyone could talk about was Kim Kardashian.  People were so blinded by Kim Kardashian West's spotlight whether it was positive or negative that they could not see past her spotlight you know to know that if Kim had not had gone to the White House then this great-grandmother would die in prison.   People like Alice Johnson sentenced to life in prison for federal drug offenses - getting them free is the mission of Brittany's work with the Buried Alive Project. And it is a central piece of her memoir called A Knock At Midnight A Story Of Hope Justice and Freedom. In this chat Brittany and I talk about the many ways the war on drugs has never ended how it is ruined the lives of so many incarcerated people and what it is going to take to even start to make things right.   I think some people may be unaware or may think that the quote-unquote war on drugs is - they may think that that is a relic of the '80s and the '90s. But obviously there are people who are still very much locked up very - you know and that a lot of these laws even the ones that have been somewhat addressed in some changes have not fully addressed even the discrepancies that you are talking about. Can you talk a bit about what has changed in federal law and what has not?  Yeah absolutely. And you know I will start by saying that the utter failure of the war on drugs is still very much at play even in 2021. And it started in the mid-'80s you know with the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act which implemented mandatory minimums which implemented this 1 sentencing ratio between powder cocaine and crack cocaine. And what that means is Ayesha you could have 500 grams of powder cocaine I could have only five grams of crack cocaine and we are going to receive the same sentence in prison. And it is not lost on anyone today and especially in the late '80s that more affluent white people were using powder cocaine and crack cocaine was running rampant through communities of color - in particular Black communities. And this law had a racially biased impact a disparity in sentencing to where even today nearly 70 of the people in federal prison for drug offenses are people of color. And we really have to have people think about time and what that means. We throw around numbers and sentences like 15 years and 20 years as if it is 15 or 20. Fifteen years is a very long time. My mother served 2 12 years in prison and that was a very long time. And I think once we really stop to feel that to feel time that hopefully it opens hearts and minds in a way that can help us shift the paradigm. Most of my clients are serving life sentences. There is no parole in the federal system. Alice Johnson was set to die in prison. That is the reality of it. She was serving the same amount of time in prison as the Unabomber.  You know that was something that would always get to me when President Trump - former President Trump - you know 'ecause I covered him - he would talk about Alice's case and he almost would underplay it because he would say she served 20 years I think she had about 10 more. And I would always go no she had life. She was going to - it almost was like he did not get like what he had done.  Exactly.  And - because I think a lot of people think life they think you know a very violent crime or murder. I do not know that people really think about drug offenses and you getting a life sentence.  I agree. And I heard you know former President Trump say that several times you know like Alice had 10 years left or she did not have much longer left. And I am like does he really not realize she had life you know that she was sentenced to die in prison? So I know exactly what you are talking about and it is hard for people to wrap their heads around. But the reality of it is there are people still buried alive under these life sentences under 30- or 40-year sentences and it is both morally and economically unjustifiable that it continues to happen. Locking Alice Johnson up for 22 years or for the rest of her life it did nothing to stop the spread of drugs in America. And so we really have to reimagine what justice looks like for sure.  So I covered the First Step Act which you know the former president and Congress really talked a lot about and they dealt with some of these issues. So that crack disparity that you talked about there was a law passed during the Obama administration that lowered the disparity between powder cocaine and crack cocaine but did not get rid of it entirely. But that was not retroactive right? And so the First Step Act did make that change to the disparity retroactive so people in prison could petition to get out under the change in the law. What else did the First Step Act do on some of these issues?  Yeah the First Step Act it was a great first step. In addition to the changes you just mentioned there were three other sentencing reform provisions contained in the First Step Act one of them being related to the Three Strikes law. There are people like my client Ralph O'Neal  who under the new law would be walking out of the door and he is serving instead his 14th year of a life-without-parole sentence. The frustrating part for me as it relates to the First Step Act and many of those sentencing reform provisions is that that change in the law related to the Three Strikes law was not made retroactive which means it is not reaching back to help people sentenced before the First Step Act was put into law. So you have people like Ralph O'Neal who are serving life sentences today under yesterday's drug laws. And that is mind-blowing for me because if the law is wrong today it was wrong yesterday. So we have many more steps to take.  Coming up Brittany describes how her family inspired her to transform criminal justice. I want to go back to your memoir and talk a bit about what led you to your work on criminal justice reform. I want to go way back to the beginning to your childhood. What I was struck by when I was reading it was kind of - was how in so many ways your childhood was very idyllic with your extended family playing in the country in East Texas - I am from North Carolina so you know I could relate to that - you going fishing all of that.  Yes.  But beneath all of that there was a tragedy. Your mom was falling into an addiction to crack and ultimately going to prison. How did living in both of those realities shape you having the family and then also dealing with this - what was going on with your mother?  Yes. You know it was definitely nuanced complex. You know I use a quote in my book. I open my book with a Nikki Giovanni quote from her poem Nikki-Rosa. And she says Black love is Black wealth and they will probably talk about my hard childhood and never understand that all the while I was quite happy. And I use that quote because I wanted to show that my life was just that. We had so much love around us from extended family - my mom even - you know that we knew we were loved unconditionally. We were happy. That does not take away from the fact that it was very challenging to grow up with a mother who had a drug addiction but the two can coexist. Joy and pain can coexist. And I really wanted to show that in the book through my own story and show that as black people we are not just this monolithic struggle story. You know we are complex and nuanced and joy and pain can coexist because it did in my life. And also even though our mother went to prison seeing my mother find something deep within herself to become sober is - gives me a strength that is out of this world that I cannot even touch with words. Coupled with the love from my family you know it empowers me to this day.  I want to talk to you as kind of an overachiever to another overachiever you know?   Reading your story I did see shades of myself. You know you were an A student you did great in school. You were helping to look after your younger sister. Now you had much more of a social life than I did. I did not have a social life in high school.    That was not me.  I did not get that but...  I definitely had a social life in my life.   Yeah see you had it. Yeah you had it. So you had more going on but did you feel a pressure to be the best at everything? Like what was driving you?  You know it is a great question and it is something I have thought about before. You know sometimes you know people have asked is this just an innate drive to succeed or was there something around you you know that drove you to succeed? And I think the answer is a mixture of both. I think a - if I am honest with myself I can say that having a mother addicted to drugs drove me to succeed because I knew that was a path I did not want to take. But I also know that I had this loving extended family around me - right? - through my dad who always poured into me and let me know that I could do anything I set my mind to you know and who always encouraged me to write down my thoughts and visions and manifest it and to know that the power lies in me you know or to my grandpa. You know we talked about fishing and being from rural east Texas in the country we would go fishing a lot. My grandparents had a pond in front of their house. And I remember going fishing with my grandpa and him saying - you know listening to me vent you know my teenage woes whatever I was going through at 14 and him listening so intently to me. And once I finished - and he would say it as not nothing but a step for a stepper big girl. You just got to keep on stepping. And so I just would...  Yeah.  ...Always remember to just keep on stepping.  Keep on stepping - yeah. I mean how - were you really afraid that you might end up in the same position as your mother or did you know in yourself that that was not the route that you were going to take?  I do not think I was afraid I was but I knew I did not want to. So I think...  Yeah.  ...It is what you said - the latter. Like I knew in myself that that was a route I did not want to take because I would seen the devastation that it caused.  And ultimately you know you were listening to your grandfather. You end up stepping on into law school after doing some business stuff but you were focused on corporate law.  Mmm hmm.  And then a childhood friend of yours gets life in prison for a drug offense and you start looking into these drug war cases and you saw some disturbing trends. One thing that really stood out to me in your book and that surprised me even though I have been covering this stuff is this talk about ghost dope - quote-unquote ghost dope and how people can get locked up and charged with these massive amount of drugs. But the prosecutors do not have to have physical evidence of it. I think people think it is like the movies where you have like a warehouse of drugs and then they pull up and the police see the briefcase of money. And that is how - that is what the case is. But that is - does not - reading your book opened my eyes to the fact that that is not really the case with a lot of these drug cases.  It is definitely not the case with a lot of the drug cases - most of them in fact. And I had the same idea of what this looked like to go federal. You know to have a federal case I just assumed that oh wow this has to be a person who is tied to international drug trafficking or cartels you know or major kingpins only to learn once I got into law school and started really looking into these cases is this is not the case at all in many of these situations. And I learned about this concept of ghost dope. Taking the case of my client Sharanda Jones for example who was serving life without parole for her first ever conviction felony or otherwise. Sharanda Jones had never even received a traffic ticket before. And so she utilizes her constitutional right to go to trial whereas most everyone else on the case pled guilty. And several of the people who pled guilty chose to testify against Sharanda in exchange for lesser sentences for themselves including the drug supplier that she worked for. People were testifying oh Sharanda Jones purchased this much drug. Sharanda Jones served this much drugs. And there were no drugs. There was no physical evidence no controlled buys no undercover agents no large sums of money no photo surveillance absolutely nothing. Sharanda Jones was held accountable for 24 kilograms of crack cocaine based solely on the testimony of people testifying against her for reduced sentences.  Yeah. And I am reading about Sharanda - and Sharanda is really - when your memoir - you talk about Sharanda as a case that really seemed to change the course of your life meeting her. You know you learned about her when you were looking up these cases. And you did what I think most people would not do - is you read a story that seemed unjust and then you did not just leave it there. Like what made that difference for you like to not just read the sad story but then to take the next step to try to help?  You know there was something about Sharanda Jones' case that just tugged at my soul. I came across her case in law school. I was going to write - I was writing a paper for a critical race theory course. And I knew I was going to include my childhood friend Keyon Mitchell who had gotten a life sentence but I wanted to include a woman too because by now my own mother had went to prison and I knew that incarceration was impacting women on a tremendous scale. And so I did a Google search - like woman federal prison life. And Sharanda Jones' case pulled up. And I saw so much of myself in her. She was also a Black daughter of the rural South. And it was just something about her case that truly tugged at my soul. And I knew that even though I was going to practice corporate law even though I knew next to nothing about criminal law that I was going to somehow someway free Sharanda Jones.  And this was something that reading the book kind of stood out to me as just how wild this war on drugs was. But when you were talking about you know Chuck Norris the actor - Walker Texas Ranger Chuck Norris that one - makes an appearance in this book. He helped the police carry out a raid I think in Sharanda's hometown that ultimately ended up leading to her arrest because it caught someone else up who was connected to Sharanda. But at that part of the book my notes was just Chuck Norris and a question mark. I am like...  Right .  ...How is Chuck Norris participating in police raids? Like how does that happen? What was going on?  Make it make sense. Make it make sense.  .  They were actually shooting the show you know around the time in Texas - the Walker Texas Ranger show.  Wow. Uh huh.  And somehow Chuck Norris was floating you know as a reserve officer for the Tarrell Police Department. And he participated in this drug raid you know where dozens of people were arrested early one morning in Terrell Texas. And he was kicking in doors.   Actor kicking in doors on the side. You know but it kind of plays into the idea that so much of this especially back then was this idea that made it seem like the drug war was like a movie and the police were going in and they were getting the bad guys and you know hauling them away. Like that was the view that was being put out there.  Yes it was romanticized. It was like a fetish of seeing Black lives destroyed especially as it related to the crack epidemic you know where we saw people being demonized and criminalized from drug users to people who sold drugs you know? And the part that we cannot ignore is how different it looks now that we have the opioid epidemic. They were both epidemics you know? They were both destructive in their own way but now we look at it - rightfully so - as a public health crisis. It was a public health crisis in the late '80s early '90s as well when it involved crack cocaine but because it was so demonized and vilified you know people 30 years later are still paying the price with their lives.   Coming up Brittany talks about the need to pressure Congress to act.   When you think about what needs to happen next and you are working to help make systemic change through getting these people out what does Congress need to do next? What - and you said earlier that Congress is the people. So people need to put pressure on Congress to act. What should they be you know trying to get Congress to do?  The people should absolutely be applying pressure to members of Congress to prioritize transforming the criminal legal system. The very first step has to be making those laws contained in the First Step Act retroactive. Now that should be a no-brainer. It is shock to the conscience to think that we can change a law in this country and it should not be mandatory that these laws are retroactive. I think you know Congress needs to take a very hard look at the MORE Act that was introduced last year - and hopefully it gets reintroduced again this year - that decriminalizes marijuana in this country. I am even hopeful that they will push forward to legalization of marijuana in this country. I have people in the Buried Alive Project who are serving life without parole for cannabis. And as my client Ferrell Scott would say people are selling marijuana today and getting a life savings I sold marijuana and I got a life sentence. And I would also - you know beyond Congress I would like to see this administration the Biden administration reinvigorate the clemency process and really normalize clemency in a way where it may not make national headlines every time but that it is having a national impact on communities and people's lives. And so I am hopeful that we see many more clemencies to come.  Is there something - I know you talked a bit about this earlier but - you know how people you know will talk about years in prison or say it is only five years it is only you know 10 years or whatever but - and they do not understand how much every day in prison affects people. But what is something that you think people do not understand about the U.S. prison system that you wish they knew?  I wish people knew just how the U.S. prison system affects entire families and communities. When one person goes to prison the entire family goes to prison. And I wish people knew just how much untapped genius is behind bars - the human capital the ingenuity that this nation really needs to thrive. And it has me just really pondering and sitting with this vision of creating sustainable liberation. How do we create sustainable liberation for this untapped genius so that they can be put in positions to thrive and not merely survive? And that is something that I feel the general public does not know and I wish that they did - just the amount of human potential that is wasting away behind bars.   Thanks again to Brittany K.
