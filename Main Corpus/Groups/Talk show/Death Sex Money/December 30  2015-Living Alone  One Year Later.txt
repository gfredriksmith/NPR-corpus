Jen When I moved into my place by myself I probably spent the first few weeks in a tank top and underwear. Until it got a little bit colder and then Id put socks on. This is Death Sex  Money. The show from WNYC about the things we think about a lot and need to talk about more. Im Anna Sale. Last year I asked for your stories about living alone. For 37-year-old Jen in Brooklyn living by herselfmeant not always wearing pants. Jen It is really awesome to sit around your own apartment in as little clothes as you like to wear. Thats just one of the perks that you told me about. Cooking the things I want to eat playing the music that only I enjoy listening to. Dancing around my living room to R-E-S-P-E-C-T. Countless minutes of no interruptions. Books stacked in a certain way on my shelf. It is definitely a freedom that I have not had ever. More and more Americans are living alone. The number has tripled since 1970. And today more than quarter of American households are home to just one person. So there are a lot of people having this experience. But we dont often talk about it. And from your stories its clear that the way we feel about living alone can be a little complicated. The first couple months it was actually kind of hard for me to live alone because I was so used to always living with people. You know everyone always said how important it was and how itll be a great time in my life. But I just have not figured out why that is just yet. Living alone near Boulder is really expensive. But it is worth every penny. Living by yourself does mean having no one to split your bills with. But it isnt something that only rich people are doing. In 2014 people who lived alone had a median income of about 28 thousand dollars. When Ashley Ward moved back to LA she decided that living alone was worth the investment. She was 30 and this was the first time shed ever lived by herself. When we first spoke shed just moved in a few weeks before. And Ashley told me having her own place felt weird.  You know when youre little and youre wearing your moms shoes? It felt like that. You dont fill out the shoe or the apartment at all but here you are pretending like you do.  Clomping around in shoes that are too big for you.  Yeah exactly. And it feels a little bit better now. I think Ill feel a lot better once I get a couch.  You wrote in and a line that really stuck out to me was you said no one thinks its normal for a 30-year-old professional woman to be able to live alone.  Yeah thats been the most bizarre thing.  What do you mean?  Theres just a weird sort of whoa really? Instead of like a yeah cool.  Is that because it means you have a certain amount of money?  I think so. It is very expensive to live in LA it says how much you make without saying how much you make. And I think that thats definitely something that makes people feel inadequate I guess?  How has it changedyoure single?  Yes.  Has it changed your dating life living alone? One of the drawbacks of having roommates is your dating life is on display to other people in your apartment. Thats not the case when you live alone.  No no. I can sort of come and go and bring whomever I like. Which isI mean Ive only been there for a month so it hasnt happened. But.  Do you like that idea?  Yeah I like that I can have guests and I dont have to worry that someone else will come in and like sort of take charge of the conversation and take charge of my guest. The guy that I lived with in Chicago would do that all the time when I had someone over he would come in and make the conversation all about him and his life.  Like including dates?  Yeah. It was super awkward. It was really really awkward. That helped Ashley make the decision to live alone. And a year later Ashley reports that she is no longer single. And...  My apartment no longer feels like an empty place that Im trying to pretend Im grown up enough to have. I got a couch in May so its a place that I like spending time now. But for a lot of you living alone wasnt a choice. It was a consequence of a bigger change often a loss. Like a death or the end of a relationship.  My name is Walid Shantur and I live alone. Walid is 60 and has lived alone for the last eight years. A year ago he sent in this message from Ithaca New York.  I left home when I was 17 and joined the Navy and lived with 350 men on a ship for four years. And then I got married. And I was married for a little over 20 years. And after my wife came out to me I was quite devastated because my daughter left for college the same day that my wife moved out of the house. So all of a sudden after all those years I was alone. I would have to say I was in a funk for a good part of six months to a year. Then I started realizing how satisfying it was living alone. I told one friend that was considering becoming single that I personally found it intoxicating being by myself. But I never thought that the case after all the years of being with someone and being happy being with people I just found out that I was quite happy to be by myself. But in the last year something changed.  One day I met a woman that came from Europe to attend a seminar at Cornell and we noticed early on that we had quite a bit of chemistry. So we spent a lot of time together going out to dinner cooking going to movies hiking to local trails and yada yada yada. Shes back in Europe now and I can no longer say that living alone is pleasing and satisfying. In fact I told one friend that while she was here I was alive again. A year ago Glen Uhlig was also getting used to life after a marriage. He and his wife separated three years ago. He lives by himself part of the time in Elko Nevada.  So this house is quiet. Cricket quiet. For seven days and then bama six- and eight-year-old boy back in my life. School homework cooking laundry cleaning eating brushing teeth... Glen splits custody of his boys with their momone week with her one week with him.  Monday at school when I drop them off and Im driving away from school I knowI guarantee theres this great big sigh of phew its like -- I survived. I really feel like I survived theyre no emergency visits they went to school theyre safe.  You also describe in your email the sound of the quiet when the boys arent there. Are there parts of that that you have been surprised that you enjoy?  For sure. In the past two years its like the only time that I have felt like I had time to you know it sounds horrible but to maybe read a book again you know? Or sit down and I get about one weeks worth of newspaper and that is when the boys are gone. Because theres so much hustle and bustle when theyre there. Having that quietness that solitude to totally re-boot yourself. Its something that I know that I needed to be complete. The real reason I can give 100 percent to my kids for that seven days is because I have seven days off where I can make sure and set up and prepare and have a list of everything I need to do for the next seven days. A year later Glen has a new thing to balance  Kids time AND girlfriend time. Im still working on needing to be a planner type of person. Kids are doing great. They both are doing really good in school which helps with thinking that theyve adapted. Right now my biggest worry is keeping enough food in the house to keep my two T Rex-eating boys in the years to come fed. Lisa Wagner is also a single parent. She told me she started fantasizing about living alone when she was a teenager.  I remember imagining a small cottage by the ocean.  And when did you first live alone?  I havent.  Why not?  First I was too young then I was too poor. And then I was a mother.  How old were you when you had your first child?  Barely 22. Lisa lives in Portland Oregon. She got divorced four years ago just before she turned forty. She told me that tensions around their shared space were a major factor.  I felt like I worked really hard and earned a lot of money and came home to a house that wasnt really pleasant and I was frustrated with that. The night after we had that final fight and we decided to separate I couldnt sleep and I lay in bed. I started imagining how I was going to fix up the bedroom once it was just mine. And it got me through. I got rid of almost everything in it. I sanded every inch of woodwork. I caulked I painted I scrubbed the floor on my hands and knees and polished it. I put in a special rack just to hang scarves onI wear a lot of scarves. And its just a sweet sweet room now. And I can keep it so tidy. And I love going in there in the evening and laying down.  So when will you live by yourself?  Well right now I live with my daughter. She is not going to stay with me much longer. Shes almost seventeen. Once shes out on her own it will just be me for the first time.  How does that feel?  Quiet. Almost too quiet. Like that feeling when you get up earlier than you usually do in the morning and the world feels like it hasnt woken up yet. It feels like thats what my house will be like. Lisa wrote to us recently that she has a new favorite room her living room which is now redone too. My daughter and I spend many hours there and I adore filling it with visiting friends she wrote. She says shes still a single parent happily divorced and she added I will soon reach the end of many years of having never lived alone. A luxurious bedroom of her own was also a dream for Arlene Pickett.  I had always wanted a feather bed duvet. And I thought it was very interesting that when I did get something for myself that it involved something that provided physical pleasure. Coming up what it was like for Arlene to live alone for the first time after her husband died. Weve had such a good time checking in with everyone in this episode. I always say that the best part of my job is getting to read the emails that come in to our inbox. And it keeps getting better. Because more and more youre talking to each other. Like with our episode about Diane and dealing with autism in families. It stirred strong emotionsand A LOT of comments. And some of you disagreed but it was with thoughtfulness and sincerity. And youre helping each other out with other life dilemmas. There have been two great threads on our Facebook page lately from people just asking for advice. Were thinking about how to do more of this in the coming yearboth on the internet and in person because it is been really fun to meet you in places like Brooklyn New Orleans LA. We hope you can come to our next eventit is January 27 in New York. Its a collaboration with the public radio show Selected Shorts. Ticket information is on our website at deathsexmoney.org. But no matter where you are keep in touch. Our email is deathsexmoneywnyc.org. And thank you for a really great year. -- This is Death Sex  Money from WNYC. Im Anna Sale. Arlene Pickett is 73 years old and living alone for the first time. Her husband died five years ago after a long decline. Arlene took care of him so it was an abrupt change to be all on her own.  I wasnt particularly lonely but I did feel a strong sense of just being by myself. Anything I needed to do or anything that needed to be done it was up to me to decide when and how much to spend. And even to do it or not to do it. And of course my husband didnt choose to be ill and I did not choose to have him ill but the demands of that really took a lot of the element of choice of what I wanted to do away from me. So it was as the months have gone by its been a good feeling to have that sense of control back. Not control exactly but that sense of being in charge. Have that back.  And it also sounds a little more complicated at this point in your life because you also need people.  Yes exactly yes. Arlene was diagnosed with cancer in 2014. With that came chemo.  During those days everything was an effort. So I was pretty good at anticipating you know I need three days of stuff I can just walk into the kitchen and within 90 seconds be sitting down and eating. Because cooking was really wouldve been very very difficult. And then little thingsI have a couple of cats so somebody had to scoop out the litter boxes during those three days and that was really more than I felt like doing.  So it made you feel vulnerable in a way that you had not felt before in your home.  Right yes. And I debated I never did but I debated when I went to bed at night leaving the front door off the latch. So that if I did need to call 911 I wouldnt need to get to the door to unlock it. Part of me kind of wonders you know is this what its gonna be like? Am I going to be one of these elderly people you read about that is all by himself or all by herself and nobody checks in nobody calls and then something happens? That kind of weighs on my mind. Its been about two years since Arlenes cancer diagnosiswhich her doctor says is an important milestone. Arlene says I am feeling well. I cannot quite think of myself as out of the woods but I can picture myself standing near the edge of the trees looking at the sunshine in the clearing ahead of me. A lot of you echoed Arlenes quiet fears about safety when youre alone at home. I still lock all three locks on the door every night. Sometimes you do miss having somebody else in the house with you. When like a scary noise happens in the middle of the night. In fact I lock them at every point in time Im in the apartment. Sometimes its hard for me to go to bed because I think about how easy it would be for someone to crawl up the fire escape and then kidnap me. I think about the scene in Frankie and Johnny when Michelle Pfeiffer is eating alone in her apartment and she starts choking and she gives herself the Heimlich over a chair. I realized that had I fainted and hit my head on the tub I couldve been dead and found naked in the tub alone.  I usually leave the door open.  Why do you leave the door open?  Well what if I call for help and they cant get in? Ernie Major is 71 and has mostly lived alone since he and his wife split and his kids left the house.  I live in a single-wide trailer in Vallejo California and I do have a few guns so I have a gun safe right next to where I sleep. I just leave the door to that open.  How long have you lived alone?  Absolutely alone Id say seven or eight years. Something like that. Has its upsides I was up 'til 3 last night baking and watching TV and stuff. But it gets very lonely and thats where the dogs come in.  Do you talk to your dogs?  Oh yeah. Not long conversations and they in that on my days off and stuff they need and want to go places and it gets me out of the house. They kind of lift you up.  What were you baking last night 'til 3 in the morning?  Bread and a pie. I just got frozen stuff and baked up a loaf of bread and a blackberry pie. Which Im looking forward to. Fact that is gonna beI havent eaten breakfast yet so bacon and eggs and pie sounds like a balanced meal to me. Since we talked Ernie had open heart surgery. My wife let me move in with her for about three months after that but I am back where I was he wrote. Working a lot because other people were covering for me while I was off and now I need to work their shifts so they can take some time off.  I went back to work I was feeling intense financial pressure being faced with divorce. Like ah I gotta get back to work. Four years ago when Richie Moriarty was 31 he was married and living in Boston. Then his wife told him she was leaving.  I wasnt eating wasnt sleeping well and there was this one day at work where before work I went to Dunkin' Donuts and got a couple of donuts. I got home at like 5 pm and realized not only have I not eaten anything all day but I didnt even eat the donuts. So I think at this point I got a call from my ex that triggered something so Im having this terrible moment and I was like I just need to get in the shower and like start this day clean. And at the same time Im starving. Im so hungry. So I grabbed a glazed donut and I ate it in the shower. I ate a glazed donut in the shower. And I dont know if thats rock bottom...  Or bliss.  ...or rock top. It was bliss it was bliss. Richie lives in New York now. He moved after the divorce to do more acting. And in February he moved in with a new girlfriend.  Its been exciting and comfortable and all those things that you hope it will be when you make the decision to move in together. Living with someone after not living with anybody can feel good. Like for Jen. A year ago she was really enjoying living alone and running around her apartment without pants. But then she had leave her apartment because the building got sold...and she lost her job. She broke up with a boyfriend around the same time too. Jen I moved into this apartment three days before starting grad school. I do live with a roommate and shes great. And she has two cats who are awesome. I totally love the cats. Yeah so lots of changes but I am looking forward... I think it really opened me up to new possibilities that really anything is possible. I got through all of that and um it was not... life didnt end. But living with someone again...means re-introducing compromise into your home life. Before my husband and I moved in together I never expected debates about how many animal parts should be displayed in a house.  But a change that was harder for me was losing time to myself. Because when I lived alone that was automatic. Its not something I had to carve out.  Its a pretty huge deal that its coming to an end. Melissa Sorrells lived alone for the first time after she got divorced from her first husband. When we spoke last year she was engaged to be married again...and her fiance Dan was moving in in three weeks.  Ive always been afraid to be alone like I would have some anxiety about what I would do to fill my time. But it turns out thats not such a problem. I manage to fill the time pretty well.  On a night when youre by yourself in your place what do you do?  I do a lot of yoga. Ill push all the furniture to the side and Ill stretch which is very helpful very calming. Actually Im wondering how thats going to work once Im living with someone else. Because Im not going to be able to shove everything against the walls.  Have you startedsince this is three weeks away that hes moving inhave you started noticing the small details that might change and feeling a little wistful?  Um wistful isnt the right word. I do not think I am going to miss it too much. Because hes a good sleeper. Hell sleep in on a Saturday morning and thatll give me like enough of my own space. Yeah a little nervous like hows this going to work? If I just drop my purse on the middle of the floor Im not going to be able to do that anymore. I need to find a place to actually keep it.  But its neat how when you describe his sleeping in like how youre aware that youre going to have this time that you get to do the things that you have realized make you feel good. By yourself.  Yeah definitely. And even just spending a couple hours with a book uninterrupted where hes not going to be like hey lets make popcorn! Hey pay attention to me Im here Im a human. Itll be good like I know that Ill have a couple of hours. That makes me sound horrible doesnt it?  No!  Its definitely something I value. A lot. And I dont know if I realized how much I valued it because my ex-husband he worked nights a lot of the time and he worked long weekends so it was always something that made me so anxious I never realized how important it was to have my own quiet time my own space.  Yeah instead of an absence now it feels like a gift.  Yes exactly! After almost a year of living together Melissa says its all gone smoother than she expected. And she was right. Her fiance Dan being a big sleeper...is really nice.  Hell sleep late on the weekends and a lot of times he goes to bed before me so I also have some of my own time for just me.  What do you do on Saturday mornings when hes still in bed and youre up?  Sometimes I do laundry sometimes its even just like watching Greys Anatomy which he does not watch. I will just watch it on a Saturday morning because then I feel like I did something like I enjoyed my thing but it didnt like come up into our time together.  And you got to watch watch Greys Anatomy without feeling bad about it.  Right.  So no matter how many people live in your household theres something to be said for closing a door...to pretend youre the only one around.  Death Sex  Money is a production of WNYC Studios.
