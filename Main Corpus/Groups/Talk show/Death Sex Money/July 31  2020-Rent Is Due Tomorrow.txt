Hi everyone. Today is July 31st which means that for many people rent is due tomorrow. And we want to check in on how stable youre feeling in your housing. Because according to a recent survey nearly a third of Americans were late on their housing payments in July...or missed them altogether. The total amount of back rent owed in the U.S. is more than 21.5 billion dollars.Â And for some its just going to get tougher. The federal eviction moratorium expired last week... And as of this morning theres no deal in Washington to extend it. Theres also no deal so far to re-up the additional 600 a week for unemployed people that expires today. All of this has led the COVID-19 Eviction Defense Project to estimate that as many as 23 million renting families are at risk of losing their housing by the end of September. Thats 20 of all renters in the U.S. So if youre worrying about how and if you are going to be able to stay in your place we want to hear from you. If youre managing to make rent but its tight what tradeoffs are you making to be able to pay? And if you think you might need to leave your place because of money where do you think you might go? Whether youve got rent or a mortgage payment--if youre stressed right now you are not the only one. Tell us whats going on for you by the end of the weekend. Record a voice memo and send it to us by Sunday night to deathsexmoneywnyc.org.
