 You are listening to It is BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I am Sam Sanders and this week we are bringing you advice from the one and only Dear Prudence.    Dear Prudence...  Well it is really Jenee Desmond-Harris.  I am Jenee Desmond-Harris. I am the Dear Prudence advice columnist at Slate magazine.  She took over Slate's Dear Prudence advice column earlier this year. You know as we head into the full swing of the holiday season what better gift could we give to you the listener than answering questions about your family and friend troubles and giving you more nuanced solutions than the internet's perennial favorite of just break up which is actually my favorite? My advice to everyone having couple trouble - break up.    I do.   I think we should break up.    What?   Well I have been thinking about it and I think it is the right thing to do.  Jenee is someone who does not give advice that always ends in just break up. And because of that she gets some complaints online.  I really try to think about what is something this person will actually do? And that is not always the thing that I think is the best idea. And I find that when I hear negative feedback from readers they are saying no you should have just told her to leave him.  Oh yeah.  You should have just told them to break up.  But here's the thing - they are not going to break up.  That is the thing. And that is really hard. I remember when you and I were talking when I first got this job you said if you were an advice columnist you would just tell everyone to break up.  Yeah.  And I get it because honestly most people should right? But we know that most people will not.  You know another piece of advice that I like to offer that is usually always very salient is be quiet. You do not have to have an opinion or a comment about everything. Silence is powerful and sometimes even healing. That is my advice. I say this as someone who talks for a living. I know. I know. I know. Anyhoo in this chat Jenee and I talk about everything from how to deal with an overbearing adult daughter to Taylor Swift to the group dynamics of religious prayer in an atheist household. With that let us get to it. Happy holidays and listeners thank you for your questions.   We got a lot and I am going to start off by telling you one that we are just not going to answer because it was too short and weird. But here is the question that we have been joking about here on the team for the last few days. The question was one sentence one question - should I leave the family business? Anonymous. That was it.  That was it?  And I was like oh you got to go. Like there is no - the anonymous was like oh you got to go.  I lean strongly toward yes as well. I mean it is just that - I am comfortable answering it yes.  OK good.  Because you want to.  Yeah.  A lot of times I think just the act of writing into an advice column gives you so much information about the person's situation.  Yes.  Like if you saw a tweet from Sam Sanders that said ask me for advice and your first thought was can I get permission to leave the family business you need to leave.  Then you should leave the family business.  Yeah.  Yeah. Anyhoo with that let us get to our formal questions. My colleagues Jinae and Jordana have gone through a long list of ones that we got sent to us and we are going to share our favorites with you and ask you to give our listeners some advice. Here's the first one. It is from someone who calls themselves Bummed in Buffalo. They wrote Dear Prudence my love of 10 years has his 32-year-old daughter still living at home. He sent her to a good university but she has no job and seemingly not many friends. Before the pandemic he and I would go out five or six days a week and I rarely saw her. Now I go to his house to make dinner a few times a week. His daughter will not join us at the table but she hovers around interrupting our conversation to complain about something one of us has said or to demand he fix something she has created to be angry about. She often tries to monopolize his time while I am there and if we ignore her behavior she attacks him or picks a fight until he tells me I should go. For example she often goes on about how she cannot wait for him to die so quote her house quits smelling like old people - end quote.  Oh my God.  He says he is unhappy with the situation but feels trapped. I am starting to feel the same way because this is depressing nonsense but I love him and do not know how to help. Any advice? Bummed in Buffalo.  Wow.  That is something right there. Let me tell you I am never having kids.  It really is.  I am never having kids.   Or dating anyone with kids right?  Yeah .  This sounds really hard. I want to validate that. It sounds awful. It sounds like this young woman probably needs some outside help. So I have a piece of practical advice which is you do not have to be at his house all the time. It sounds like this was working before the pandemic. Can you have him over to your home? I just wonder if there are any practical solutions to sort of avoid these interactions. But more broadly a principle that I believe is true is that you do not change people's relationships with their children no matter how much you think they should change or how right you are about that. I think it is a losing battle. This is clearly the kind of relationship they have had for a long time so do not try to manage or control the situation. But I do think there is room here for one good clear talk. And by that I mean just - and this is the advice I give in a lot of situations - the letter writer may have kind of alluded to some problems here or said this made her uncomfortable or showed her discomfort but I wonder if she is really had a sit-down with her partner and talked about the toll this is taking on her and sort of what her limits are how much of this she can handle. I think she needs to let him know very clearly how much this is upsetting her and what is at stake and then sort of take a step back and see how he reacts.  Yeah. You know I hear it and I want to know what is the backstory of the relationship between this father and this daughter? I feel like - is there something in their history that has the father feeling so guilty that he thinks he has to keep letting her live in his house and exhibit this bad behavior? I do not know what it was. Reading that letter to you I said to myself oh I wonder if this is a divorced family and the dad still feels guilty about his role in the divorce and how it might have hurt this child.  I can totally see that being the case.  And it is like - and so I am like is that having him continue to accept this really bad behavior from her because he feels bad about I do not know not being the best dad he could have been years ago? But to that I say apologize and live in the now. And the now is 1 your 32-year-old daughter with a college degree is still in your house - not a good look for any parties involved - and 2 she is running the relationship. I do not know not to say break up with your daughter but listen - break up with your daughter. Sorry I am not supposed to give advice.  Right.  You are .  No I mean you are absolutely right. I think you are absolutely right that that is what he should do. And if he were writing in I think that is definitely what we would tell him. I am just not sure that his partner is going to be able to say one thing and get him to change the way he is related...  No.  ...To his daughter for his whole life which obviously has like deep emotional roots. So I do not see the relationship changing dramatically. That said she should make her concerns known and give him a chance to change it before she leaves.  Yeah. Is there any advice as to when this woman should know when it is time to totally just leave? How do you know when you have reached that moment? Like what if she has the conversation? How does she know how to proceed after that and when to like say that enough's enough?  I think she has to check in with herself about exactly how distressed she is by this. So is she merely annoyed or is it really taking a toll on her life or is it stopping her from enjoying the relationship? So I think some self-reflection on that would really help. And then on a more practical note I would have the really clear talk with him and give him like two months to absorb it and take some action.   All right. Coming up Dear Prudence answers more of your advice questions including one about Taylor Swift.   Next question from Nicole  in St. Paul - she says I am a geriatric millennial - stop right there. I do not like it when they say that.  .  Makes me feel bad.  I do not either 'ecause I am the oldest possible millennial.  Wait what is your birth year if I can ask?  May 1981.  OK I am '84. Yeah. Yeah.  OK. So I think by like the most generous interpretation of millennial...  Oh yeah.  ...I squeeze in there as the oldest possible one.  Can you quote any lines from Reality Bites?  I watched that movie so many times but I do not think I could actually quote a line.  So then you are probably spiritually Gen X.  OK I will take it.  I do not know. Anyway neither here nor there.  Anyway.  Here's Nicole's question. She wrote I am a geriatric millennial with no kids and no significant other and live at least an hour from all the closest people in my life. I am also one of those introverts that loves to be social with people she knows but it sucks more energy being social around strangers. As an adult I am finding it extremely hard to make friends especially when not collecting friends through osmosis via children or partners. How does one go about making friends as an adult when you are not the outgoing life-of-the-party sort? Is there an app for that? Nicole in St. Paul.  The first thing I want to say is that this is so so so common. Actually there is a Slate podcast called How To! and the October 19 episode was all about this dilemma. So they brought in a woman whose husband is in the Air Force and has moved a lot so she is always had to make new friends. And she gave some really good advice. I am going to sort of recycle it here. She said the No. 1 way to make friends is to ask for help. So if you are in a new workplace you know asking where do people go for lunch or could you give me a hand with this task or help me understand this colleague of ours - even if you do not really need the help just asking can create the conversation and make people feel useful and start a relationship. She also said to be OK with being desperate. It is OK to say I really want friends and I need help. And I would say you can ask your friends to match-make you. You could put a post on social media.  Oh that gives me anxiety.  That is one thing social media is great for.  That gives me anxiety. Oh my god.  Or latch onto someone else who is doing it. A friend of mine did sort of a friend matchmaking thing on Instagram. She asked all her friends from different places to say where they were and what they were looking for and just that invitation really opened it up for people. So I think just being OK with sharing the need and knowing that you are doing a service to other people when you do that could be really helpful.  So my editor Slacked me while I was reading that question and she says this letter writer is engaging in some negative self-talk. And I think I agree. Like that line where she says I am not the outgoing life-of-the-party sort - you do not have to be. You know like...  You really do not.  And like she says I am one of those introverts that loves to be social but knows that it sucks - like she is kind of downplaying her skills and not just accepting the reality that like in our current era of internet and living away from home it is hard for everybody to find and keep friends. And I wonder how much of it is not just the difficulty in having friends but thinking that she is just a worse person and can never make friends and how much that hurts her as well.  That is such a good point. I wonder if there is a different way she could have written this letter or just a different way she can talk to herself where she is saying - instead of I am not outgoing she could be saying I am a great listener.  Exactly.  Or you know I love doing crafty activities at home or I am a big movie buff.  Yeah.  And I love other people who enjoy movies. So I am sure there is a different way she could frame this that would feel like she is not operating at a deficit of some kind.  Yeah. And like I also made peace in adulthood with realizing that I do not have to do everything that I do in my life or in my day around other people around my friends you know? Like I used to think that I could never eat alone in a restaurant. Now I love to right?  Right.  I used to think that I would never want to go to the movies by myself. That is my favorite kind of night you know?  Right.  And so there is also a moment to just check in with yourself Nicole in St. Paul and say are you underplaying how much enjoyment you might get from doing some things by yourself? And that is OK. Like do you have this unnecessary expectation that you need to be around people a certain amount of the day or week? Let that go.  Right. She does say that she has introvert tendencies even though she appreciates being social. There is a place for an introvert day.  Come on.  My mom gave me a great piece of advice that I sometimes tell people. You should not feel like you are in enemy territory when you are by yourself.  Woo. Woof . Yeah.  It is good right?  It is real good.  I mean you want to feel comfortable. You do not want to feel anxious and nervous and like you have to fix it just 'ecause you are alone.  Yeah. Next question - this is about Taylor Swift. It is from...  Timely.  Yeah yeah. It is from anonymous. Oh my God well first before that - have you listened to the ten-minute song that is all about Jake Gyllenhaal?  I have not. I have read a lot about it and a lot of commentary and a lot of people getting like upset about whether it is good or bad. But I have not listened yet.  I listened. Let me say this. All the songs are catchy. She makes catchy songs. But...  She really does.  ...Ten minutes 10 years later about this man you dated for a few months? I am not going to say get over it but I am going to say get over it. She needs some advice.  Wait but was not the song written years ago and she just redid it?  She expanded it to make it ten minutes long so she added more.  Oh she expanded it?  She added more to be like and Jake Gyllenhaal one more thing.  OK I...  And I am like OK you all.  Oh wow.  Now come on now.   They say all's well that ends well but I am in a new hell every time you double-cross my mind.  Well what advice would you give Taylor Swift?  You know what? I would actually tell her it is good and the way you can think of it is that you are clearly helping a lot of other people because what you are saying is resonating and it is letting people know they are not alone.  OK. What advice would you give to Jake Gyllenhaal who is just still in these songs 10 years later?  Oh I would be like just skip it when it comes on. Like...  .  That is her. She is doing her thing. Like it is not actually about you at this point.  Oh man. Let me tell you. Anyone thinking about writing a song about me do not do it. Do not you dare.  Or if you do do it in a timely fashion not 10 years later.  Yeah exactly. You get one year after breakup to write a song about me.  .  After that I am filing a cease-and-desist buddy OK? Cannot do it. All right here's the question from the Swiftie . They are anonymous. They wrote quote I have recently converted my boyfriend to Swiftie-ism . He is not as big of a fan as I am but he knows and likes lots of Taylor Swift's newer albums Lover and beyond though he is not as excited about the rerecorded albums as me. If Taylor goes on tour any time soon I am planning to buy floor tickets no matter the cost. My question is hypothetical. Should I take my boyfriend since a live show might make him an even bigger fan and get him into her older stuff or do I go with the tried-and-true Swiftie who I know would go absolutely rabid with me?  This is so easy. Bring the tried-and-true Swiftie.  Come on. Or stop being cheap. You love Taylor. Buy three tickets. Call me crazy.  That is true. But if it comes down to it I mean this friend is going to appreciate it so much more.  Yeah.  I hate to say it but the boyfriend might not be around in a few years.  .  And the friend probably will. And you will have this memory . And it just seems like Taylor Swift is a friend experience. It is not romantic.  Taylor would say do not bring the boyfriend. She would say bring the friend.  That is the best advice. Taylor would want you to bring your friend and not your boyfriend.  . Stay with us. Coming up mixing religion and Thanksgiving. I have some thoughts on this one. Before we get to some more questions I want to go back to just like your life as Dear Prudence. You crowdsource a lot of your advice questions and I like it. You will take a question to Twitter and say chime in with your answers. If I like one or two I might share it in my response. What was the impetus for that? And how is it going?  So every week I do a live chat. And then I do a regular column. And in the beginning I was trying to answer one of those questions. And it was about if I remember correctly a woman who was bisexual but had never actually dated another woman and she was not sure whether she should apply for - I believe it was like a scholarship that was for queer people. And I was just like I do not know. I am not - I want to answer her question but I would love the input of people who actually are bisexual or who have thought about these issues more than I have. So I took it to Twitter and I got some really good responses that I thought were so much smarter than the one I originally sort of came up with. And I think it makes so much sense for an advice column because in this day and age we all have social media. And you rarely make a decision just by sitting quietly by yourself and thinking.  Yeah.  It just made perfect sense to me that I would ask for input from the many smart people who are out there.  So what advice did you end up giving to the woman who was considering whether or not to apply for the scholarship?  So my uninformed advice was going to be you know what? Probably do not do it. The intention of this scholarship is for people who are queer who probably have suffered some kind of discrimination or setbacks because of that or are going to end up using the platform to like advance LGBT issues. So maybe just pass and leave this one to someone who is a little more engaged with the community. But I was set straight by the responses where so many people weighed in and said this person has internalized biphobia. Like she is bisexual whether or not she has acted on it yet and whether or not anyone knows. And we really need to be careful about sort of policing who gets to be bisexual and who does not. Many people shared their personal experiences with that. And they also pointed out that nowhere in the scholarship or application materials did it say you have to be out. You have to have suffered discrimination.  Yeah.  And so I said you know what? Go for it. This is yours as much as anyone else's. And it might even help you sort of like on your journey to feel more clear and secure about who you are.  Yeah. Last question - It comes from anonymous. They wrote  usually my family has a really wonderful and relaxing Thanksgiving with my family and one other family my mom's sisters. Nothing big. And we are all in agreement about our fundamental beliefs. No big Thanksgiving blowups over here including religion. We are all atheists. My uncle mom and aunts' brother just died. And my mother has invited my other aunt his widow to our Thanksgiving which she accepted. However knowing this aunt I am certain that she will be leading a predinner grace likely to be longer than most and very intense including many tears. She would be the only religious person at the table and we would be in our home. So the host my family would also not be religious. In the past when I have been at tables where grace is being said I politely join hands and bow my head slightly though that is all. However those have also been places where the host is the only one saying the grace. Question - when the host as an atheist the guest is saying the prayer what is the proper etiquette? The easy solution is to bow my head and join hands as I would in someone else's home but that feels fundamentally dishonest to me. How can I politely excuse myself from a prayer without being rude? Anonymous.  So my disclaimer here is just like constitutionally and personality wise. I do not like conflict and I am OK with a little white lie to avoid conflict.  Yeah.  At a recent holiday my husband's 94-year-old grandmother asked us where we went to church out here in California. And we do not go to church never have. And he and I kind of locked eyes and just communicated to each other OK we are just going to fly real quick here. And so I just put the name of our city together with the first denomination I thought of and told her.  Wait. Say it.  I said we go to Palo Alto Baptist.  .  And she said wonderful. And everyone was happy. And I am fine with that. I am also not religious but I am totally fine with holding hands. Closing my eyes bowing my head and having a moment of quiet meditation or gratitude or just silence before a meal. I do not see that as fundamentally dishonest and I would challenge the letter writer to ask themselves who are you being dishonest with? Also if everyone else has their head bowed and eyes closed you do not have to bow your head and close your eyes 'ecause they will not see you.  Come on.  So  you can just sit there. But I get the feeling that the letter writer knows all that and they are actually asking like a deeper question. Or they have a deeper issue which is that it is the principle for them. I think there are kind of two levels of responding to this that could help them be more comfortable. One would be go to your aunt before the holiday. Explain your discomfort and say you are my guest. I want you to be able to say grace. I am not comfortable being part of it. So what we are going to do is I am going to get up and say I am going to go to the kitchen and get the gravy. Start without me. And that will be your cue to do grace while I am in the kitchen. Or if you really want to be bold and it is your home you can let her know that you are not comfortable with that at your table.  Yeah. You are nicer than me.  .  I just find this anonymous question asker to be a little self-centered and selfish. They point out in the letter that her husband just died.  Oh yeah.  She is a new widow right? She is going through it. And I think that everyone at this point in the family knows who is religious and who is not. So this anonymous person being in the same room where a prayer happens - I do not think that is going to convince anyone in the family that they are no longer an atheist right?  Right.  Like we know where people stand. So there is a reality in which you just sit there do not close your eyes and just be quiet.  Right.  I do not know. I just - I am someone who prays and I am a Christian. And I have been in a lot of environments where people either are not praying or they are praying to some different religion. And you know what I do? I smile and nod.  Right.  Let me tell you I have crashed so many Ramadan dinners...  .  ...Where I will just do what I need to do to be nice to the host so I can eat the food you know?  Right.  And it is like I know I believe in my belief enough and they believe in their belief enough to know that like hospitality is not going to damage my or their belief right?  Right.  Also to act like you saying I do not want you to pray in my house is going to keep prayer out of your house - the thing about people who pray is they can pray silently as well.  Oh definitely.  They can pray silently in their heads all up and through your house.  Right right. I think this is a great example of how in many questions there is an answer that has to do with what you have a right to do. And it is not the same answer that is - that means what makes the most sense to do. And again I did not really focus on that part of the question but I think it is such a good point that you made that this aunt is mourning someone right now. And there is just a place in life especially around the holidays for just trying to be compassionate and generous to people when it costs you absolutely nothing.  Yeah it costs you nothing. My auntie cannot pray at my house. Pssh .  .  Your auntie is already praying at your house buddy.  .  Aunties like that - they are always praying OK?  Right. About you specifically...  .  ...By name.  Yes literally. Let me tell you - if you make her not say her prayer over the turkey her first bathroom break she is going to be on that toilet whispering to Jesus.  .  I guarantee it OK? OK?   Thanks again to Jenee Desmond-Harris. You can find her over at Slate's Dear Prudence advice column. And thanks to all the listeners who sent in their advice questions. All right.
