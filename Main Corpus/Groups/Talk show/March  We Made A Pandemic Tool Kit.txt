 Hello. We made it to Friday. Im here in the closet of my back bedroom. Are you also home? Its almost the weekend and you know what that means for me? Ill still be home. So we thought one way we could help organize this long stretch of uncertain time is with some assignments. Home-work assignments. Here's your first one this week youve helped us start building a Pandemic Tool Kitits a Google spreadsheet of things that have helped you. Things to listen to things to watch things to do places to give. Theres a link to that in our show notes. Your assignment this weekend is to do something off of that toolkit and then send us a field report. It can be a picture a voice memo anything... well share some of those reports back in our newsletter next week. So here are some ideas from the tool kit Robyn recommends making Smitten Kitchens Chickpea Nachos Making something that requires just enough effort to feel like you accomplished something but without having to work that hard. Our colleague Kim Nowacki recommends listening to some REM after she screameddanced to It is The End Of The World As We Know it  and she found it very cathartic. I an going to take Erins advice and tackle that home improvement or cleaning project you have been wanting to finish. I have a stripped screw situation that is keeping a window from closing properly and god help me I am going to fix that this weekend. Send your field reports to us to deathsexmoneywnyc.org. It can be a photo a voice memo recording an email telling us what you did. Send it in by Monday morning and well share with all of you how we are putting this toolkit to work. Subscribe at deathsexmoney.orgnewsletter. And again you can find a link to the pandemic tool kit were building together in our show notes. Take care of yourself this weekend.
