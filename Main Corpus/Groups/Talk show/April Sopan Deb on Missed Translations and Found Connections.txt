 You are listening to It is BEEN A MINUTE from NPR. I am Sam Sanders. Sopan hello. Hi. How are you?  Sam how are you man?  Pretty good. Pretty good considering. You know surviving.   I bet. Yeah it is a very unsettling time.  My guest today is Sopan Deb. He writes about sports and culture for The New York Times. And we actually met each other back in like 2015 2016 when we both were on the campaign trail. ...Both were recovering a Trump rally.  Yeah. That was 20 years ago.   Right? But for our chat today we talk about something a bit more personal. Since we last saw each other Sopan wrote a memoir. It is called Missed Translations Meeting The Immigrant Parents Who Raised Me. It is all about reconnecting with family which is a thing that in this time of the 'rona  and self-quarantine a lot of us are thinking about right now. Like how do you deal with family when everyone's stuck in the same space together for days or weeks at a time? Or how to deal with family when everyone's worlds apart? For Sopan's family it was a bit of both. They were not just distant physically they were emotionally distant as well. The way he describes growing up they were basically strangers living under the same roof. So in this chat Sopan and I talk about how and why his family often did not feel like family at all and why he chose to travel to India to reconnect with his father and what he learned about himself in that entire process. OK let us get to it. Here's my chat with Sopan Deb.   So about the book - I read it the last few days - I am very worried about giving away spoilers here. So I want you to give our listeners a 30-second elevator pitch for it without giving away everything.  Sure. So the book tracks a year of my life as I try to reconnect with my estranged parents. They were arranged to get married. They are both from India. They are both Bengali. And they had a really toxic arranged marriage. So we grew up in a really tough household. And I did not know anything about my parents. We barely spoke growing up. I did not know their ages their birthdays how they met how they came to this country what they were like as children. And as a result we grew up as distant acquaintances. And eventually we did not see each other for years. And at the time I started writing this book I did not even know where my parents were living and I was barely in touch with them.  It is really hard to overstate how distant you were from your parents. You already said it but there is this graph on Page 7 of the book that just kind of stopped me in my tracks. You write  at some point in the latter half of the 20th century they were arranged to be married. I could also say though without complete assurance that they both were from India. But I did not know where in India they were from. I was not sure how old they are. I did not know how many brothers and sisters they had. I was pretty sure their parents my grandparents were all dead. I had no idea what they were like as children or what they hoped their lives would be. I never asked. They never told me. Wow. And this is with people that you lived with growing up. Like just explain to our listeners how that can happen when you all grew up for the most part in the same house.  So at a basic level - right? - we did not really eat dinner together because frankly like we did not like being around each other. It was like living with a college roommate that you barely speak to which is ridiculous because they are your parents and they are your family. But we...  Yeah.  You know my parents barely spoke to each other or if they did speak to each other it was through shouting. We just never got to know each other. My parents really did not assimilate well to the United States you know. And so part of it also is we grew up in a mostly white suburb called Howell N.J. which is right by Point Pleasant. It is near where the Jersey Shore was filmed if you remember the Jersey Shore.  Oh yes I do.   If you remember the Jersey Shore. Sorry. Go ahead.  Yeah that is our generation. You know I spend a lot of time you know kind of seeing my white friends and they had solid stable relationship with their families. Their dads are coaching them in baseball and basketball. They are able to talk to their moms about crushes. And you go over to their homes for dinner and you would - they would all eat dinner together and talk about their days. I did not have that. And it was kind of this false conflation of you know warmth and safety and skin color. But really I would dread coming home because at home it was just kind of this empty cold environment. And then the result of that is we never got to know each other my parents and I.  In a house like that on any given day like how quiet was it? When you wake up is everyone getting breakfast on their own? Does everyone go to school without saying have a great day I love you when you get home? Does everyone just sit in their own rooms? Do you eat dinner alone? Who has control of the TV? Like I want a little more of the scene of this eerily quiet disconnected South Asian home.  Yeah. It was quiet. My dad was out of the house right after eighth grade. We mostly ate dinner separately. I ate dinner watching TV mostly. I mean I essentially did my own thing you know. We all did our own thing. Both my parents worked. My dad was an engineer. My mom worked at Drug Fair which is like a Walgreens Duane Reade Walmart type thing. And then at night you know when they would come home I would be in my room or I would be in the basement playing computer games or you know I would be out with my friends or whatever. But there was very very little communication between us. And just to underscore that point my mother did not know what colleges I had applied to until acceptance letters started coming in. You know and at the time I would not have had it any other way.  Were there moments when the silence just built to a head and there were confrontations? And if so what did those look and sound like? I imagine at some point the iciness and the quietness would just blow up.  Yeah. If there - yeah there were blowups. If there was communication they went to blowups very quickly. I mean one of the things you know I feel is universal in this is that I think the generation before me and you is - you know they did not know how to properly communicate emotions. My mom dealt with a lot of depression you know when I was growing up and just never knew how to treat it properly.  Well the way that she would deal with it from what you wrote was just locked herself in her room for a few months.  Absolutely. Yeah. So for most of eighth grade I did not see my mother. She locked herself in her room. And she dealt with a lot of - you know it was clear that she did not want to deal with the world at large. And something I have always wondered about my parents - and as I wrote this book after I wrote this book - is I just wonder if maybe they could have been rescued if they sought counselling early on and just were able to get on the same page just a little bit. And I do not know. I do not know for sure. But I - but the thing is my parents did not even have the language to speak like that.  Yeah. So you have this upbringing. And then a few years ago you say you know what? I think I will try to fix this and not just by talking to my parents but like writing a book about it. When did you say this will be my path to resolving this? And did - was there an idea of doing it differently without the grand gesture of an entire book?  So the first and foremost - I decide to reconnect with them for a simple reason which is - I did not know their ages. I did not know where they were living. But I know that they did not have much time left on this planet. And frankly it gnawed at me that I never had a proper relationship with my parents. And I was like well if you do not try now they could die today and you might not know that they passed away and you will never have given this a chance. So the journey I wanted to take I realized I wanted to document in some way. I told my parents right up front when I called them initially to you know - I said look - I am going to write a book about this.  All right time for a break. Coming up the moment in a Chinese food buffet that Sopan will never forget. B-R-B.   I want to get to the central reasons why the home life for you was so strange growing up and so disconnected. Perhaps if I can say this the biggest reason is your mother and your father probably never should have been married.  Yes.  And you explain that.  One hundred percent.  OK.  Look - my mom did not want to marry my father. The reason they got married is because my father had immigrated to the U.S. and was living in New Jersey. He was lonely. And so he did what many other Indian men of the generation did is he put an ad in a newspaper. And then my grandmother on my mother's side as I found out later responded to the ad on behalf of my mother without my mother knowing. So my father goes to Canada where my mother and my grandmother on my mother's side are living. And he knocks on the door. Essentially you know - and my mother is there and has no idea why you know her soon-to-be betrothed is there as well. And who are you? Well essentially my mother was never consulted on this marriage. And essentially my grandmother pressured her into marrying my father. It was a bad match from the start. She did not want to get married to him. And look - the thing about this is that divorce is very stigmatized among South Asian families. So they did not even get divorced because you do not get divorced. You do not even think like that.  Yeah. Yeah yeah. You know when I got to that part of the book where you unpack that I kept thinking you know we are in this moment where Americans are increasingly disillusioned with this Western model of quote-unquote love marriage. And to hear you or to read you talk about how this arranged marriage did not work it felt a bit out of line with a lot of the rhetoric I hear now in some corners of the country singing the praises of arranged marriages and quoting stats that say that they can often have better outcomes than love marriages. And like in a way just you writing your parents' story and how the arranged marriage did not work it upends this positive if unfair trope about South Asians right now and that they are better at marriage.  Yeah and I will also...  No one's better at marriage. Like all marriages can suck.   Right. Right. And what makes - what is a good marriage? Is a marriage something that just simply stays together? Like what is the mark of a good marriage? Like my parents were in theory before they got divorced - they were married 30 years. Technically - on a very technical level under the stats we are talking about they were a good marriage. They were together. They had - they were raising two kids in the suburbs of New Jersey in a house. And you know both kids you know have done OK for themselves. So on its face that is a successful marriage. But that was not - it was never a successful marriage. I would also note that there are plenty of arranged marriages that have that love that we talked about and are perfectly fine. And so this story is not like the story of all South Asians this is the experience of one particular South Asian story. Now are there things that I think that are kind of universal? Yeah. For example the lack of kind of the willingness to take on mental health treatment and communication about feelings. So that is something that is universal. But for the most part you know it is not a monolithic thing if that makes sense.  Yeah totally. I want to - so I want you to set up one of the stories in the book that really stuck with me - you and your dad at a Chinese buffet having a really heartfelt moment in the aftermath of the Twin Towers falling.  Sure.  And I like this story because it really underscores this way that in spite of the dysfunction of the family there still were these moments of intense connection.  Yeah. So basically one morning - I think I was an eighth-grader so it was shortly after 911. I remember one of the kids - he was a little bit of a troubled kid. He made some joke to me about wearing a turban or something like that something very racist. And I was a skinny toothpick of a kid. And I went up to him and to the shock of everybody in the room - all the students and whatnot - I punched him in the face. I straight up punched him you know. And I sucker punched him. It was not you know something to be proud of. And so he - this kid runs out. He tells a teacher. And then you know I get suspended rightfully so. And so the vice principal calls up my dad to come pick me up from school. You do not want to be a brown kid and be suspended from school. You do not want that to happen.  Yeah.  So I am in fear for my life here.  Yeah.  My God. I get in the car and we do not drive home. We are driving - you know we are driving down a highway for a while. And I am silent. He does not say anything.  And that is the worst fear...  Yeah.  ...Because you are like where is this parent going to take - like that is happened to me before.  Right.  And I am like we are driving to a cliff and they are throwing me off. Oh my God.   Right right. I was like well this is a - it was nice - you know a nice 14-year life while I had it you know.  .  And so we are driving down the highway. He takes me to my favorite restaurant which was this place called the Freehold Grand Buffet. It is this giant totally ridiculous Chinese buffet but I used to love going there as a kid. My dad sits down and he says - he looks at me and he says I understand why you hit your classmate but you should not have done that. You should not have hit him. Violence is never the answer and you know just never do that. And I was ashamed that I - you know I did not say anything. I - and we had never had this kind of conversation before. And that was to this day I think my father's finest moment as a dad.  Time for one more break. When we come back what it meant for Sopan to get to know his Southeast Asian heritage and his parents as people. B-R-B.   You say early on in the book that you were quote strangely comfortable writing material about being South Asian despite my thorny relationship with being South Asian. Explain what you mean there and then tell me if writing this book made your relationship with being South Asian better or worse.  To your first question - so yeah. So I have been doing - part of what pushed me to write this book was being a stand-up comedian. So I have been doing stand-up comedy and other forms of comedy in New York going back about eight years now. And when I first started doing stand-up I tried to be like Jerry Seinfeld. Hey what is the deal with airline tickets? And then I started talking about being brown in spite of the fact that for most of my life I have run from being brown. I felt like a fraud on stage. I felt I was playing the part of being a brown guy even though all I wanted my whole life was to be white. And so over time you know that is where I felt most comfortable on stage even though it was not who I felt I really was. That is partially why I decided to write this book because I wanted to find out who I really was and frankly like you know if you are telling brown jokes on stage you know maybe that is who you really are. You know maybe your skin color you know matters to you a lot more than you realize. To your second question as to whether you know this made me feel more comfortable with being South Asian yes absolutely because I know where I came from. I know like how I got here you know. And those are things that I think are really important to your sense of identity. I feel much more connected than I ever felt in the past. Does that mean that I am fully connected in the way some people are? No not necessarily. There are things that I - you know I feel in some ways that the culture failed my parents in many ways you know that my parents would not have lived the life they did if it was not for cultural expectations. But there are definitely parts of it I feel much more connected to now.  You lay out in the book that as soon as you start to really get to know them your parents are hilarious. Like they are characters.   Yeah.  Your mother is a pop culture maven who likes to type in all caps.  Yeah.  Your dad is this eccentric art collector who commissions art to fact-check historic paintings. Like is there a world in which this book does not work if your parents were less interesting? Also you have got to explain the whole painting thing to our listeners. It is so beyond.  Yeah. I mean it was as bizarre to me as it is to you. My father takes me to his flat in Calcutta where he was living or is - currently lives I should say. And...  Because you end up going to India to connect with him for the book.  Right. So we fly to India to go see him.  Yeah.  And he has a bunch of paintings on the wall. And my dad is so eager to explain that these paintings are historically accurate paintings. And among them is like The Last Supper and all this. I am like what do you mean historically accurate? And my dad you know when he sees things that he finds to be outlandish he wants them fixed. So in the case of The Last Supper I think that in the da Vinci Last Supper you know all the apostles are wearing sandals or something. And in my dad's painting you know he commissioned an artist to get rid of the sandals because if Jesus washed their feet you know why would the apostles dirty them by wearing sandals - or something like that.  .  You know in one of the battle paintings which I am not remembering the name of right now - it depicts a famous battle. Like he like put in more dead bodies you know?  .  Like stuff like that. And it was just the most - I am like Dad this is what you spent your money on? Like really? Then to your earlier question about like would this book have worked if my parents were not such characters? I do not know. I think it depends on what the conversations were like. But certainly my dad just being such a - both of them being such you know eccentric people certainly added to it you know? From the first conversation my father and I had in the car when he had picked us up from the airport you know he is telling us you know that he is part of a cosmology club and he is doing - you know he does yoga and he loves golfing and he plays tennis three times a week. And that was one of the most shocking things about this whole thing because I had not seen my father in 11 years. And what I expected to see was this frail weak you know kind of close-to-death guy. But instead what I saw was a man that was full of life and with more hair than I had.  Yeah yeah. Was there a moment when you get to India and you see your father for the first time in years and he is living - kind of living his best life - did you at all resent that that the best version of himself that he could build for himself happened once the rest of you all were not there and once he left Jersey to go to India to build that life?  I would say there is slight resentment because look at the end of the day my father left the country. He left and did not tell me and he did not come back. He chose not to come back. And he was not there for a lot of my big moments in life - graduating college and you know getting my job at The New York Times or you know whatever. You know name the - you know whatever. On the other hand you know once you find out in the course of reading the book of why he left why he felt like he had to leave this is part of the thing about looking inward and realizing what I contributed to the situation. And also it is a question of empathy. And I am empathetic to my father and why he decided to leave once I discovered why. And it was a combination of just he felt like he could not be here anymore. He felt like he was going to die. And he was overwhelmed with anxiety and depression. And he was laid off from his job. And there are all these other reasons. But he felt like in order to keep living in order to be whatever father he could be to me he had to go back home. And home for him is not New Jersey. Home for him is India. And so there was a lingering bit of resentment but I have since forgiven him. My brother told me after he read the manuscript - he said this journey was not ultimately about you know reconnecting with my brownness. The journey was ultimately about forgiveness. And that was a really profound thing that my brother said to me and that has stuck with me more than anything. Ultimately this journey was about forgiving my parents and that is what I did.  How has reconnecting with your parents in writing this book changed the way you think you will approach raising your kids? Like is there a way you thought about how you would be a dad before this book? And is that different after writing this book?  You know what is funny Sam? I actually have been thinking about that since I was 14.  OK.  This has been a long-term discussion for myself because I have always known I wanted a family of my own. And I also wonder you know - I do not know this for sure. This is for the therapist. I wonder if because I actually want to have kids more because of my parents because I do not want to have what they had.  Yeah. And you got to take the kids to India to see Grandpa right? Like that has to - I kept thinking like the sequel to this book is you taking your kids to India to meet your dad.  I hope so. You know I - yes absolutely you know if my father is you know God willing still around when that happens. Look you know Wesley and I are not close to having kids at this point. You know we are supposed to get married next year. Who knows if that happens with corona and whatnot? But yeah I would love for that to happen and I hope that my father gets to meet Sopan Jr. and Sopana. Do not tell Wesley that.  Sopana ? Sopana OK.  .  Thanks again to writer Sopan Deb.
