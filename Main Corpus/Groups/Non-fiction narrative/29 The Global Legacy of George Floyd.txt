 You are listening to NPR's ROUGH TRANSLATION. I am Gregory Warner. What we often do on this show as you may know is look at a story or an issue playing out in another country to try to gain a fresh perspective on those same issues in the United States. But what we have seen in the last two weeks...    Black lives matter. Black lives matter.  ...Is people all around the world watching what is going on here in the United States.   Black lives...  Matter.  Black lives...  Matter.  ...And looking into the mirror at their countries...   .  ...From Amsterdam to Tokyo...   .  .  ...From Nairobi to Rio de Janeiro.   .  .  It is a moment when people are speaking out some for the first time. It is also though a moment to slow down and listen.   And so that is what we are going to do today. With our team of producers and the help of NPR's international correspondents we asked five people on five continents what this moment means for them in their country from their perspective.  The George Floyd protests give us a legitimate language to articulate what is wrong with police brutality.  What does this moment mean for black people in other countries?  Like listen - this is not an American problem. This is a bigger issue that we need to look at.  And how far from Minneapolis will Floyd's life and death be felt?  The power and impact of George Floyd will save lives of my people and my grandchildren.  Five stories of George Floyd's emerging international legacy when ROUGH TRANSLATION returns.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. I am Gregory Warner. Today five stories of George Floyd's emerging legacy around the world. Our first voice comes from Amsterdam.  People have trouble understanding that there is actually a race problem in the Netherlands. For a long time the Dutch felt like we were the perfect multicultural society.   My name is Don Ceder. I am 30 years old. And I was born and raised in Amsterdam where I still live. My father he is from a country in South America called Suriname. And my mother she is from Ghana. I am a lawyer and I am a city councilor right now in the city of Amsterdam. I think I was at the house. I am frequently on Twitter so that was the first time where I saw the George Floyd images. And that was just gruesome. I saw George there but it could have been me. I saw my uncle. I saw my dad. I saw my cousin. And that kind of broke me.   We have less police violence. That is something that the United States has is something else. But what you do see is that - a more institutional form of racism. I am just going to give an example. As a lawyer I came with my client at the court and my client is a white older guy. And the judge immediately started talking to him for the first two minutes until I interrupted the judge. I said hey I am the lawyer. That is the client. I do not think the judge did that on purpose but that is showing you like how deep this actually is. For decades people of color have been asking the Dutch government to apologize for their role in the trans-Atlantic slave trade. And the answer has always been that they feel sorrowful but there is no need to apologize. And it always got brushed off.  So Don and some other city council members of color narrowed their focus. Instead of trying to get the national government to apologize they focused on the city where they actually had some power.  Amsterdam to me - and I think for a lot of people - is the most beautiful place on earth. When you look at it how people financed those houses and those canals a lot of it came directly from the profits gained in the slave trade.  And this February they got Amsterdam to agree to apologize. The actual ceremony's been delayed because of the coronavirus to next year. Don says that one reason it is been so much harder to extract an apology from the national government is because of the way that the Dutch make decisions. Everyone has to come to consensus.  The political system is set up in a way that most of the time it ends up in slow progress because you actually give everybody a little bit of what they want. And therefore there is a major consensus and that is how you can move forward. But the downside to that is when you have situations when there is social injustice when there is inequality when there is racism - then I think the way of slow progress that that is not the way. If something is wrong you need to fix it right now.   I do feel that the protests not just what is happening in the United States but also that people are standing up in Amsterdam across the Netherlands and maybe also the firmness and us really pushing the agenda for the apology that it really also made the people in the Cabinet in the government really see and watch saying hey this is something big and this is not going to go away. There was a press conference 'ecause of the demonstrations in Amsterdam. And the prime minister who is from a right-wing party he actually said that there is no denial that there is systemic racism also in the Netherlands. And you might think - well that is true. But to me I think this is the first time our prime minister actually acknowledged that in such a way that he actually said it is systemic you might even say institutional. And that is something big. I am hoping it is not empty words that just fade away in a couple of weeks. That is something I am hoping and I am striving for as a lawyer as a city councilman but also as a black person living in Amsterdam.  Our next stop is Auckland New Zealand which is about as far in miles at least as you can get from Minneapolis Minn. But there are protests there over George Floyd's death where you can hear the haka which is an expression of the indigenous Maori people.   .  Haka for Maori is - it often gets described as a war challenge. But it is - I think that is a very simplistic description. It is a challenge. That is what it is. But it is not necessarily like a challenge to go to war . It can be used to celebrate. Like people do them at weddings. People do them at funerals. But people will do them when you feel the moment. Like in that protest that happened in Auckland in recognition of Black Lives Matter it is a fully supportive and shared solidarity. That is what that is.   .  My name's Julia Amua Whaipooti. I am from a tribe or iwi in Aotearoa New Zealand - Ngati Porou. I am an Indigenous woman from New Zealand and I am pretty out the gate insanely impatient for change. I am very outspoken about things.  Julia is Maori. She is a lawyer and an activist. The Maori and Pacific people make up about 25 of the population of New Zealand. But she says...  Sixty-six percent of times that police have fired their guns in the last decade that they have  have been on Maori and Pacific people. And those underpinning issues around racial bias systemic racism and practices are ones that we see experienced in our own policing in terms of who do they use their force of whether that is tasers guns release dogs et cetera. And in a New Zealand context it is Maori.  New Zealand is one of only a handful of countries where police do not carry a firearm on their person. This goes back to a British tradition established in the 19th century to avoid a police force that is too much like a military patrolling the streets. But in recent years some Kiwi police officers have pushed to arm police the way they are in most of the world.  So there have been a number of us who have been strong advocates both publicly and in lobbying our government to say do not do this because they already use their lethal weapons on Maori. And they already overpolice and interact with Maori already. So if we put guns in their hands as well to interact with us that is going to mean lives.  This debate over guns and police took a huge shift last year.   Anti-Muslim terror attack in New Zealand...  In the city of Christchurch an avowed white nationalist entered two mosques during Friday prayers and killed 51 people.   ...Were praying.  The man who is claiming responsibility and charged with murder is an extreme right-wing white supremacist.  He describes himself as an ordinary white man who was born in Australia.  That was last March and it was the deadliest mass shooting in the modern history of New Zealand. The following October...  The head of the police came out and said in response to that attack they are patrolling 247 armed police with militaristic vehicles...  A pilot program where teams of fully armed police would be sent on patrol.  ...In three communities two of which are predominantly Maori and Pacific communities those predominantly brown communities.  Even though the perpetrator who inspired these rules was white.  They said oh it is for everyone's safety and it would only be used in extreme cases. By February the majority of their work involved pulling over people for routine traffic stops. And so it is called the mission creep right? And this came out from their own communications. Public communications was well we do not want them sitting on their hands.  The police did not want these trained teams to be sitting idle.  Yes I 100 want you sitting on your hands and not on your guns in our communities. Sit on your hands. And so many of us had been drawing parallels to the United States in the sense that we are on the precipice of heading towards an Americanization of our policing.   And the sad thing is - and I think it is sad - that it takes something like George Floyd happening over in the States to make everyone in New Zealand go oh we do not want that. And this is what the murder of George Floyd by the police and the visibility of it the impacts that it is had worldwide - the ripples that are felt here on our shores. All of our Maoiri MPs who are in government at the moment come out in the last two days say they do not support that general arming of New Zealand police. I mean our prime minister was forced to answer questions about whether she supported the arming of police in New Zealand and she came out and said no.  In the days following George Floyd's death the hashtag ArmsDownNewZealand trended to No. 1.  There were some discussions and tensions around that - you know about whether it is a movement that is been co-opted to try and do something over here in New Zealand. And I very strongly - I will do anything to make sure that our people can just breathe as ourselves. I will do anything to stop the arming of police because the fact is that it is lives. It is not a discussion some conceptualized sort of issue. The reality is it is our lives.  And this week the New Zealand police commissioner announced they would not be extending the pilot program of armed police teams. He said he was committed to New Zealand police remaining generally unarmed.  I would almost say it would be impossible for the police to come out now and say that they are going to arm the police in the way that they were planning. So that the power and impact of George Floyd whose life was stolen so violently and so brutally the legacy of him - of what he symbolizes to me I owe a big duty to that man because that means he is saved lives of Maori people in this country.   Almost everywhere in the world that there are protests you can find the image of George Floyd. I even saw his face on a fragment of wall which stood improbably in a pile of gray concrete with rebar sticking out everywhere - the remains of a collapsed building. Here there is nothing between George Floyd's face and the blue sky over the province of Idlib Syria. The mural shows stars behind him and the words I cannot breathe. We reached out to one of the artists and exchanged voice memos with him which he recorded in Syria in the middle of the night while his wife and three kids were sleeping.  I am Aziz Alasmar . I am 48-years-old. I am a graffiti artist. About the killing of George Floyd - this horrible crime it was hurting me because we lived that event before in Damascus and in Idlib. It is still in our brains all of us. We were attacked in Damascus - close to Damascus in a city called Al-Odah . They killed about 1500 people in the chemical weapon because they came out against the government asking for freedom. And it happened again and again more and more in different cities. And the last one were in my city in Idlib in a city called Khan Shaykhun. And a huge number were killed by that horrible chemical weapon. So how I decided to draw that mural of George Floyd - when we saw that short recording and when George Floyd was asking the police officer and telling him please let me breathe let me breathe I am not breathing please let me breathe - and I remembered my people who were killed in the same way by chemical weapons. We started to prepare for drawing painting that painful mural to show the whole world that we care about humanity because we are all human regardless the color.   The mural was on destroyed walls. That is what I always do - paint on destroyed walls. Why? Because under those walls there are lots of dead people who are attacked by Russian air forces and Iranian and Syrian government which is Assad regime. Those people who were attacked and who were killed they are under those destroyed walls. They are our families kids. So they were only asking for freedom. They only wanted freedom and that is what happened to them. And we never forget them.  Now George Floyd's image is there too so that he will not be forgotten.   We are going to turn next to Brazil the last Western country to abolish slavery. And that history now hangs over the reaction in Brazil to George Floyd's death.  I mean I met a woman not too long ago whose grandmother owned a slave. That is how recent slavery is in Brazil. My name is Lu Olivero . I am a social media consultant living in Rio de Janeiro for the better part of eight years.  Last Monday night around 8 oclock he turned on the TV to watch Comedy Central.  You know I was watching I think Everybody Loves Chris  - Everybody Hates Chris. And then all of a sudden I cannot breathe appears on the screen and the sound of a person breathing heavily. And it took me a second to really understand what was going on. And then it clicked for me what they were doing. And I - and my first intention was to turn it off. But I kind of forced myself to watch the full nine minutes of it.  This broadcast - you may have heard about it - it was on ViacomCBS networks. So MTV VH1 Comedy Central all broadcast it. But the Brazilian affiliate did something different. Among the list of names that scrolled across the screen of people who had died at the hands of police they included Brazilian victims' names as well as names from the U.S.  So it was Philando Castile. It was Sandra Bland Eric Garner Tamir Rice Trayvon Martin and obviously Joao Pedro who was the most recent.  Joao Pedro was a 14-year-old boy who was playing at his aunt's house in a city near Rio de Janeiro. The police were searching for suspected gang members and sprayed the house with bullets.  And then shot Joao Pedro in the stomach. If that was not bad enough that they took his body on a helicopter...  He died before the helicopter reached the city.  ...His parents did not know where he was. His family did not know who - where he was. And they spent more than 24 hours looking for the body.  His family did not find him until the next day in a medical examiner's office. This all happened just a week before George Floyd's death. And now Joao Pedro's name was the second one after Floyd in this TV spot.  It would have been weird if they just did George Floyd. But I think they - it gave it a depth to it a volume. Like listen. This is not an American problem this is a bigger issue that we need to kind of look at.  Lu started checking social media which is his job and he was looking at the reactions to this video.  And what is interesting about Comedy Central is that in Brazil you have to pay for Comedy Central. And traditionally speaking the large majority of people who are able to pay for this channel are middle- to upper-class white Brazilians. And there was obviously a mixed reaction from that demographic as to the importance of this. There were a lot of people who were supporting this. And then on the other side people were saying - well we do not want to deal with the United States' problems. Those are their problems. Leave them over there we do not want to deal with that.  But Lu was noting other voices - black Brazilians Afro Brazilians - who were frustrated that it took a channel from North America to draw a connection that most Brazilians were not making themselves.  It is frustrating to see when Joao Pedro was killed no one says anything. And then these very same people George Floyd gets murdered - all of a sudden it is Black Lives Matter. And I have spoken to a lot of white Brazilians about this and they are in fact more concerned when something happens in the United States than when it happens here in Brazil. So it just sort of highlights that divide. To have his legacy not be that final image of him having a knee on his neck - part of his legacy should be - is that we sort of open up our eyes to understand that this is not an American problem. Anyone who is been paying attention to this understands that it is international.   They were saying that those of us who are mourning for George Floyd are mourning for him because it is the United States and we wanted to look like we are sort of like a class above the rest of Kenyans. My name is Wandia Njoya. I am a senior lecturer at Daystar University in Kenya.  And she watched the George Floyd video the day after it was released.  Oh God. I was so horrified I did not even finish watching it. I felt a huge feeling of grief. And I think it was the grief that why should a man die like that? That was such a humiliating death. The least we deserve is to die with our friends and family in a way that is dignifying. And he had to go with such humiliation yeah. And then of course after that is when I started feeling the outrage that we cannot be here again.  She took her grief and her anger to Twitter. Then when she did there was a backlash from her fellow Kenyans.  It is an idea that anyone - any Kenyan who talks about something happening outside Kenya is ignoring what is happening in their home country. It is a hint and an underhand narrative that Kenyans use to shut people up by saying you are so colonized the only people you talk about are foreigners. It is an insult. It is the underlying insult yeah.  Wandia says this narrative in Kenya it is double-edged because she is also silenced when she tries to talk about Kenyan victims of police violence.  And it is by design because what happens is that every time we try to talk about the local deaths we get a backlash from the media and from politicians and their supporters saying think about the police these people are violent. Our young people are doing nothing and they are lazy and they are criminals. You know we are given that spiel. And because it has traction with the state and with the media apparatus our voices are not heard. And we never say at a very human level somebody died and he demands mourning. The reason why these extrajudicial killings in Kenya do not get any reaction is because our hearts as Kenyans have been numbed so much that we cannot feel anymore. And in a sense by trying to grieve with the rest of the world maybe that will help us come back to that feeling and that humanity that we have to care for others whether we know them or not.  This weekend people did try to publicly grieve and protest the death of George Floyd in a park in downtown Nairobi. It is a park I have been to - I used to be based in Nairobi for NPR - and it is often the site of protests about all kinds of things. But this time police blocked people from gathering and plainclothes officers with sticks started telling anyone who looked like a protester they had to leave. It is rare for plainclothes police to be at protests in Kenya. It is rare for protests to be stopped before they begin. It seemed that George Floyd and the aftermath in Kenya hit a nerve.  So I was saying the George Floyd protests give us a legitimate language to articulate what is wrong with police brutality. And in fact I think it was two days ago there was a - a man was killed in one of Nairobi's slums. And this time people they rioted. It has not made the news but they rioted which is not something we have been seeing for a while. I remember one of my friends who is a pastor wrote a very nice tribute talking about how she identifies with George Floyd. I can read just the first part. She says  I confess I did not watch the clip of the knee. I did not have it in me to watch it. And yet that has not stopped me from having nightmares of being unable to breathe. These nightmares have happened when I am walking in the streets when I am in class learning when I am waiting in a queue and even when I am listening to a sermon - the nerve of nightmares to interfere with worship the nerve of nightmares to show up during the day. There is a song by Juliani one of our - Kenya's local musicians which he sang after the police killed three men because they were pursuing a case against police brutality.   .  The song is called Machozi Ya Jana - Yesterday's Tears. And the translation of the lyrics is this - their blood crying for justice will run like water in the taps of statehouse. It is more than hashtags and placards. Enough is enough. That song was written three years ago but the case against these officers had languished. And then just this past week against rising pressure the officers charged with that killing announced they would enter a plea which might be at least the first step toward justice.  So we are slowly following our hearts and trying to find the language and the spirit to keep saying that this is not right.   .
