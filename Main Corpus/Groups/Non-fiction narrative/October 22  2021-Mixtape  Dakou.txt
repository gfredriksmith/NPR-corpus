   Im Simon Adler.  And Im Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab.  Truth be told I dont know if this is the way to start but lets just jump in I guess.  Yeah take her for a spin.  Alright. So Ive got a short story for you about a piece of technology that we dont think about much today and how one morning it tore a small hole in the space time continuum.  Mmm.  According to the memoir...   This is Noriko Ishigaki.  And whos memoir are you reading from there?  Yasuo Kuroki.  Okay.  She is an Japanese-English translator as well as a long time friend. And she says that on the morning of June 22 1979 in Yoyogi Park  One of the biggest parks in Tokyo magazine reporters and editors are gathered.  Maybe a dozen or so alongside somepress people from the Sony Corporation.  Okay.  And Sony has gathered this gaggle of journalists there to sort of unveil this new product for them.  Our product called Walkman.  The Sony Walkman.  Oh yes.  Now these reporters had very little idea what exactly to expect or even what this Walkman was.  And the product leader carefully hands each reporter a Walkman.  With a cassette ininside it already.  Okay.  Did you have a Walkman Jad?  Oh my god yes! It was blue steel. None of this plastic shit.    Yes I remember the way you would put the cassette in and then click it shut and there was something about that tactile soundyeah. Yeah yeah yeah.  Anyhow so these reporters put on these orange headphones  And then the event organizer says Please press the play button. One two three go!  And  Ooh.  The sound blasting into their ears and   This voice welcoming them...   And the voice says to them   Look out into the park.   And they see that they are not the only ones listening to a Walkman. There are dozens of other folks with orange headphones on moving through the park. Kids are roller skates...  College students jogging a woman exercising.  People skateboarding even a buddhist monk. Like the scene that you and I see everyday walking down the streets you know people in their own little world listening to whatever they want to  Yeah.  This is the first time anyone had ever seen that.  Amazing. Amazing.  And of course if they took their headphones off they rejoin our shared world hearing the din of the park and the city around them. But then when they put them back on theyd be back in their own little world. Headphones off collective reality. Headphones on whatever personal reality whatever mood theyve chosen for themselves.  Oh my god.  Totally yeah. And maybe you can communicate this better than me because youve lived it but like this was all so new. Like most of these people had probably never worn headphones before. Theyve never had stuff pumped directly into their ears. Theyve never listened to something outside before short of transistor radio or maybe a boombox. And theyre now doing it altogether but by themselves.  People dont really understand whata big deal the Walkman was. Like remember when Steve Jobs did the iPhone and everybodys like Oh my god oh my god.  Yep yep.  This was like that times 1000.  Youd go that far?  No really. To go from a world where you had to sit on your ass and listen to music in a specific place to suddenly you could walk like literally walk and have the music playing just for you thereby soundtracking your journey.    You know? I was like this is a movie and I am the protagonist. This is amazing. Like it wasit was amazing.  Well as amazing and liberating as it was it was also controversial. Almost immediately folks were hollering that this personalized silo intimate consumption of media was going to end communities if not society as we knew it.  Its likethe same conversations were having now about Twitter and Facebook.  Oh yeah. And so I dont know in more ways than one I think what Sony unintentionally gave those reporters that morning was a glimpse into the future.   Now Ive spent the last year listening to thinking about and researching the object powering those Sony Walkmansthe cassette tape. And what I learned is that this object this little piece of plastic changed the world. It brought down governments collapsed space and time and remade how we say those three simple wordsI love you. So for the next five weeks Ive got a mixtape of stories for you a mixtape that will take us to China Vietnam South Sudan Czechoslovakia 1940s America exploring this objects impact and how believe it or notwere still really living in a cassette world. Im Simon Adler and this is Mixtape.  Okay well Simon why dont you just take it from here? Ill just excuse myself go listen to my Walkman in the kitchen.  Alright then sohere we go.  . And in this tape Im going to pass on as much knowledge as possible about playing rock and roll.      Were kicking it off in Hangzhou China with this guy...          This is Hao Fang.      Alongside our interpreter and really co-reporter in China who for political reasons has asked to remain anonymous.    Anyhow these days Hao Fang writes about music for a living. But he says you know back when he was a kid he had no idea that job even existed.    He was born in 1963 in this very small town called Qianjiang.    Very small...  The kind of place where you walk for ten minutes and be on the outskirts already.  Surrounded by mountains lush countryside...    And super isolated.    I mean the best source of reading material he had was at that time people would use old newspaper as wallpaper.    Right like you wanna make it look good.  And so when Hao would go over to his neighbors houses...  Dash to the wall and start reading  because there is so little...  Wow.  For him to read.  But while Hao was hungry for any information about the outside world his real love wasmusic.    Right. His mom worked in this art and dance troupe.    An organization under Chinas military creating music and choreography.  What we now refer to as red songs or yang ban xi revolutionary operas.  This is historian and scholar Mabu.  Im a music fan I also write about music.  And he says these operas were really a tool of the government.  I mean of course I didnt live through that time but they were propaganda.   I mean campy over-the-top productions filled with dolled-up Chinese soldiers.    Really pretty girls long legs...  Determined peasants.    Corrupt businessmen. And in them the peasants seem to always win and the capitalists got what they deserved.    And I mean Hao loved this stuff.    I remember watching my mom sing and I would join it was simply something that made me happy.  But there was very little for him to listen to.  Because actually these revolutionary operas they were the only officially sanctioned style of music. And nationwide therewere only eight that arethat people could listen to so  There were only eight operas?! That was the off  Yeah yeah. Eight.  Eight operas. Everything else was illegal.  Does that mean if I turned on the radio in China in lets say 1974 I would be hearing one of those operas being played?  The answer is yes but then back in those years its not that common for a person to turn on the radio. Its more about loudspeakers which was I guess the most common way to listen to music.  So you dont even tune into them theyre blasted to you through loudspeakers?  Mm-hmm.   Â  It might sound unbelievable to you but thats how it was back then.  And for Hao it pretty much stayed that way for years. And years and years. But thena decade or so later...    So the year is 1948...    Wait wait. 1984?  Sorry. What did I say? 48. Oh god.    Its fine.  This is what happens when you work a 10 hour day.  Totally. Absolutely fine.  Sorry let me rewind. So yeah the year was 1984...    Hao just graduated from college and he went to Wuhan. Wuhan thewhere the virus started.  During the day Hao would venture out into Wuhan to explore his new home.    So he was just like wandering the city looking for stuff to do with his roommates.    And they just happen to stumble across this theater-like place.  A little hole-in-the-wall showing bootleg movies with a curtain for a door.    He opened the curtain and walked in and  There were a dozen or so people there small illuminated screen up at the front. He had to sort of squint through all of the cigarette smoketo really make out the screen.  But the first thing he noticed was the smell.  And not just from the cigarettes.    Peoples    Oily hair.    Feet.    Ooh.   Sorry.  You told me to describe as vividly as I could.    Ah yeah you did it. Yep.  Anyhow the movie they were showing was.  Bah bah bah bah bah bah...  An illegal bootleg copy of Apocalypse Now.    And hed never seen anything like it.  The realism. The violence. The explosive budget.   But what hit him hardest was not those smells or those images on the screen. But what was coming out of the speakers.  The Doors.  Classic scene in the movie where  The End   The Doors The End was played.    Jim Morrison.  Morrison started to sing  This is the end beautiful friend.   He remembers being frozen. He had goosebumps all over him.    It was like magic.    And so yeah Hao was just totallytouched by themusic.  Hed never heard such a simple and powerful arrangement. Basically never heard a song about death. Never imagined music could be so emotionally complicated and layered.    I think its just...    Love at the first sight really.  And he needed more of it. But...    There was nothing. Nothing at all.  I mean China was opening up a bit at the time letting some western music in. But there was an actual committee that would hand pick which songs and what they were letting in like John Denver the Carpenters...    Yeah. Very limited songs. Only really really popular stuff.  It was pretty harmless. And as for more complicated subversive music coming out of the west at the timelike no one had legal access to it. But there was a group of people in China who like Hao had gotten at least a little taste of that larger musical world.  University Students.  Right right right. Students at the university. They were some of the few people who had connections to the foreign community.  This is Kaiser Kuo.  I am a podcaster. I run the Sinica Podcast on SupChina.  Hes also a musician was born to Chinese immigrant parents and came of age in Tucson Arizona.  Which is why I talk the way I do. Everyone thinks I sound like Im from Southern California or something but itsthe Tuscan in me.  And he was living and studying in China in the late 80s and he says exchange students like him English teachers were giving some of this music to these students and they were beginning to express themselves through it.   You know the 89 protests started happening.  The Tiananmen Square protests.   Kaiser actually attended these protests.  And so you know students had taken over the entire center of the city.    These students in Beijing were demanding democracy freedom of expression freedom of access to the outside world. But also Kaiser told me they were doing this thing that didnt get talked about much. He said that right there in the heart of the demonstrations...  People would just sort of set up stacks of PA and then theyd have you know all the bands at the time just playing you know long into the night.   And you know people were in the mood to party.    This is a version of the protest that I havent heard. We only ever hear about or talk about sort of the end of them I suppose.  Right right. We dont talk about the seven weeks of just love and anarchy. It was wonderful. . Some of the happiest days I could remember.   Peace love rock and roll and yes John Denvers Country Road.   But then on the morning of June 7th...  I turned the television on  Kaiser had left Beijing and was several days behind the news...   The very first image I see is of athe charred body of a cop or soldier hanging from a bridge.   The protests turned violent.  Because they only showed you know the violencethat had been perpetrated on you know on the military or law enforcement. And there was some of course but   They didnt show all the students or the workers who had been shot.     The number of killed is not well known but estimates put it atleast a 100.   Some going up to as many as 3000.   Wow.  Yeah yeah. It was really remarkable. Crazy.  Now the chilling effect Tiananmen had on China really cant be overstated. And music got caught up in this too.  Of course after the crackdown just immediately you really cannot listen to popular music from United States or England.  This is Wenhua Shi.  I am fromoriginally from China.  He was willing to talk to us about this because today he lives in Boston where he teaches at the University of Massachusetts.  During the crackdownI was quite young how do you say then ninth grade? But I remember so vividly listening to shortwave radio.  Mostly Voice of America.   VOA learning English and then...   Listen to some like popular songs. But...  After Tiananmen...  Suddenly those are being removed. They produce noise to jam that signal. So we cannot hear anymore. Its impossible. So you feel the air is really exhausted becauseno outside possibilities.  But just a few short years later the outside came flooding in. In pretty much the most unexpected way I can think of.    Somewhere in the early 90sit was Spring.  Mm-hmm.  Somewhere in Wuhan or Xian.  Again music critic Hao Fang.    He was on a business trip and he was meeting a friend. But the friend wasnt there and he was early and he heard some rock music being played.  Hes like where is that coming from?    So he just followed the music...  Down the street and around the corner    And he saw this store and pretty much a hole in the wall.    He stepped in and he was just caught off guard completely.    It was a store filled with tapes.  More than hed ever seen in his life.  Yeah wall to wall cassettes hundreds.    Hundreds and hundreds of tapes.  And hes like What the hell is this place?    He would be like turning around and theres Jefferson Airplane.  And Michael Jackson Elvis Presley...  Turns around and theres like Bob Dylan.  Simon and Garfunkel.   And then he turns around and theres Yes band and really niche ones.  Like is this for real?    It was everything you ever dreamed of    In that tiny store.  And it was cheap.  So he thought this is his only chance to own these tapes and so yeah he grabbed all these albums.    As many as he could carry.  This big plastic bag with like 20 something tapes.    He checked out and he began inspecting his treasures.    One by one he started like examining them.   Â  Analyzing and comparing.    And he saw that each of them had been cut through the jewel case and into the bottom of the cassette.    The cut was about the width of a quarter and an inch or so deep.  And he was wondering you know like why is there some marks on these tapes? Or you know what happened to them? And I mean he didnt know but he was encountering dakou.  Dakou  Dakou  Dakou cassettes.  Dakou.  Dakou tapes.  Dakou   He didnt know where they came from he didnt know theres gonna be more access to dakou  Dakou   And he did not know it was going to be a national scene.  He didnt know these dakou tapes were about to change how he and millions of others in China thought about music. All he Hao knew at the time was that he wanted more. Well get to that right after a quick break.         Im Simon Adler this is Mixtape. Before we went to break after decades of communist party operas sprinkled only with the occasional John Denver song Hao Fang had stumbled upon a trove of cassettes filled with music that neither he nor pretty much anyone else in China had ever had a chance to hear before. And the thing is he wasnt alone.  I mean rows and rows and rows of tapes.  This again is Wenhua Shi whod also encountered one of these stores.  You see Bob Dylan and then you see no this is not just one Bob Dylan thats ten Bob Dylans. Woah. This is crazy.  And wherewere they coming from?  At that time nobody knows.  Well I mean Ive been trying to confirm thatvery origin of that very first person who discovered dakou.  Again historian Mabu.  And people have been you know telling me about this person who they call Professor Ye.  Professor Ye?  Yeah. So Ye Lao Shi. Ye.  Ye Lao Shi? Yes okay. Yes.   Ye Lao. Oh my God. Even youyou heard of this guy Ye Lao Shi.  And while we could not 100 percent confirm that he was the first guy he was certainly one of the first.  So this is I guess the most common version of the story so Ye Lao Shi he used to be a professor or at least a lecturer at the ShantouÂ  University located in Southeast China and in the early 1990s...  Professor Ye took a trip to this nearby town of Heping.  Tiny tiny sort of village in a way you know?  Maybe to do some research maybe on vacation.  I dont know why exactly but somehow he was there.  And he got a tip that he should go check out this giant warehouse. It was actually a recycling center.  What we call liu cheng.  At that time China was buying up and importing much of the world's recycling. And this town and warehouse was processing all of the plastics. And looking around at all this plastic waiting to be ground up into little tiny pellets he realized...  He was standing in a mountain of cassette tapes.  I mean to the left of him a pile 5 feet high. To the right a mound of them 10 feet high. There were thousands and thousands of cassettes each with a cut into it.  I mean of course he would be astonished. Imagining what kind of sounds are in there thinking Who is this band? Who is this singer? And he would be dying to hear the music in it. Yeah. The point is that those cassettes came in as plastic scrap and they came in tons.    That warehouse made my jaw drop for the sheer number of cassettes in there.  This again is Hao Fang who years later took his own trip to Heping to see it.    You could not possibly count how many cassettes there were.  Millions and millions of tapes yeah.  Ballpark estimates Mabu gave me put it somewhere between 45 and 150 million of them each year.  Im ready  So Simon will give you a ring here in a minute  So Ill hear him coming through the phone but Im talking into the microphone right?  Thats exactly right  Alright.  Now to figure out the origin of these millions and millions of garbage cassettes.  Hello  I gave this guy a call.  Hello is this Bill?  Yes it is.  Hey Bill. Simon here from Radiolab how are you?  Im good Simon how are you?  This is Bill Knoedelseder.  I covered the recording industry from 1982-1989.  And he says back here in the US the late 80s and early 90s were just a period of decadence in the music industry.  Oh yeah oh my god. The record companies were the cash cows. If you were Warner Brothers your record company was making more money and was more profitable than yourmovie division.  They were flush with bands selling millions and millions of records like REM.   U2.   Nirvana Bon Jovi...   So the money was enormous.  And so record execs were making big bets producing millions and millions of copies of just about everything they were releasing. Everything from Madonna to I dont know probably even the animated rapping character MC Skat Kat.   I mean they were producing so many that even a hit record often left hundreds of thousands of unsold copies let alone a flop like MC Skat Kat. And so what did they do with this surplus?  They wanted to get rid of it. Okay? And so what they would do is they would sell them in bulk for pennies apiece to a network of buyers and resellers.  First theyd end up in record stores labelled as cut outs...  You know a discontinued record is called a cut out because theyve cut it out of their active sales category.  If they did not sell there someone would buy them in bulk for pennies on the dollar again try to sell them somewhere else.  Truck stops car washes drugstores and whatever else.  And finally if nobody wanted these cassettes...  Theyd send it out to be destroyed.  The standard way they did this was to run a saw blade through them cutting about an inch deep into the cassette itself leaving a gash in the plastic and a break in the magnetic tape. And from there unbeknownst even to Bill...  Its getting there in garbage? In like bigfucking barges of trash is that what youre saying?  Exacbarge yes scrap barges.  Wow.  These cut up cut outs were thrown into shipping containers and sent to China where Professor Ye found them as these mountains of scrap.  Itake heart from this the music will get to the people no matter what!  You know?  However for this music to get to the people of China these cassettes needed to be repaired. Which is what Professor Ye tried to do.  Here's what we are gonna do. Bring the tools out here.  Okay.  His theory was essentially  Even if the mechanism was damaged you can take the tape out.  Again Kaiser Kuo.  Splice it and rewind it onto a new cassette body.  It wasnt going to be easy. In fact it was going to be a royal pain in the ass.  Okay. Here we go.  But after sawing a John Denver cassette in half   Oh yeah you went right through. You can see we got the tape itself is split.  Oh yeah.  My AP and really co-pilot on this series Eli Cohen and I also set out to see if we could do this. So first thing's first...  We are going to have to destroy it further in order to bring it back to life.  We had to get the John Denver tape outside of its broken cassette shell. Smashing it with a hammer...   Now we have got some breakage and now it is quite like the experience of cracking open a crab leg or something. There we go.      With the John Denver tape out of its cassette...  We have got screws.  Eli opened up the cassette we would be transplanting John Denver into.  And we taped the John Denver tape onto the new reel of tape.  Yeah.  Snipped off the excess.  Looks beautiful.  Oh fuck!  Struggled a bit.  Dammit!  Okay.  Eventually succeeded.  Okay. It is time to sew the patient back up.  And screwed the new cassette back together.  It looks functional!  Yeah. I do not see why it should not play at this point.  And so we popped it into my tape player.  Big money no whammies.   It does not want to move.  Did not work.  Does not  No!  Wait hold on. Hold on.  We took the tape out and tried to wind it forward manually a bit. Put it back in.  No  Still nothing.  Doctor can you diagnose the patient here?  Itthe host seems to be rejecting its new organ. I think the problem is the Scotch tape.  And so giving it one more shot we manually wound a bunch of tape from the left reel onto the right reel.  So we are losing the first song basically. It might be okay.  All right. Let us try again.  And...   Whoo!  We did it!  Now this tedious painstaking repairing process Professor Ye and others began doing it on a massive scale. Hiring folks to do the labor and distribute these tapes across the entire country. And he or someone like him eventually gave these things a name...  Dakou.  Dakou which just so happens to translate to...  Cut out. We somehow also invented this term.  And they spread like wildfire.  I left China after 89. There werent dakou at that point and I came back in 91 and 92 and they were everywhere.  Even in cities that are not that big.  Far-flung places like rmqi in Xinjiang Dali in Yunnan.  Outside of my home there was a flower shop and the flower shop was selling dakou. Thats how crazy it is.  And they were affordable for Chinese consumers to buy.  And there were so many of these things that the Chinese government really just had to throw up their hands. And so folks all across China got to have their own little Apocalypse Now This is the End moment. And for Hao Fang...    Dakou was there when he needed it the most. The diversity dakou was able to provide him totally altered his life course.  He says without them he definitely would not have become a music critic.    Andso what he felt about dakou if you have to summarize in one word isgratitude.    Without dakou he would not be him today. And Hao Fang thinks all these artists many of them would not be them either. SIMON Because these unregulatable garbage cassettes sparked a musical explosion. And totally reimagined what rock and roll was.    This is Li Yang.    Today he is a musician with tattooed sleeves crawling up each arm. And these dakou tapes are what inspired him and countless others to form bands in the first place.  Do we know the name of his first band?  I am not sure he told me that.  You know everybody's embarrassed by the name of their first band so he probably did not want to tell you the name of it.   Or he kept on saying...    I cannot remember because of the life I have lived. That is all I can remember.    So you know I can only imagine.  And that is Rebecca Kanthor.  Journalist in Shanghai.  Who helped facilitate and conduct our interview with him. Anyhow...  Come as you are as your friend as your   One of the 1st bands Li Yang heard was Nirvana. And he loved it. He wanted to hear more stuff like it but he didnt even know what genre to be looking for.  Mmm..  No. No idea.    In fact he was not even aware there were genres.    There was western music...  Uh-huh.  And there was the music that everyone was listening to in China. Those were the two genres. Because...    Nobody was there to teach us this is metal this is punk this is grunge this is garage this is emo.    We were just not clear on this in the beginning.  I mean all Li Yang had was the recording nothing else. And so he was listening to all of this stuff  With no context.  Again Kaiser Kuo.  No understanding of you know what this particular album is in the history of rock.  No sense that The Beatles came before ACDC. Or that ACDC came before Nirvana. There certainly was no sense of what was quote-unquote good.  So for example the Beatles and Bob Dylan a lot of people complained about their sound they are just you know very common sounds.  Wait wait wait. People thought Bob Dylan and The Beatles were underwhelming?   Yeah.  And in their place what folks were drawn to was  God there were so many so many obscure bands.  For example ...   This really obscure Finnish symphonic metal band.  Called Sonata Arctica.   There were a lot of them that were like that.   Stratovarius get it?   I think also from Finland. Finland was overrepresented here but   Cannibal Corpse.   Theyre a Flordian death metal band. Theyre big.  Sort of.  But I started seeing their cassettes all over in China.  And for Kaiser this is all sort of horrifying.  You know I would say for example you got to start with The Beatles and The Stones and The Who you cant skip because Nirvana does not make sense unless you understand what it was in reaction to.  Well and I totally get that. Like I studied jazz saxophone for 10 years.  Really?  Yeah yeah yeah yeah. And that is all about knowing exactly what came before what.  Right right.  And knowing who played what lick when and quoting those licks in your solos to demonstrate a knowledge or an understanding of the form.  Oh yeah. Yeah yeah.  So I do not know. Like there is value in understanding something in its context.  Oh for sure yeah.  However Kaiser says...  I mean I kick myself now for having ever done this sort of School of Rock teaching.  Hmm.  Because he says of what happened next. Mid-2000s Kaiser's at a music festival in China and who does he run into but...    Li Yang and the band hes fronting.  Called Demerit.    I see these guys. They show up to sound check and they have got gigantic mohawks denim jackets and the spikes on them Chuck Taylors.   Sex Pistols Ramones .  They are dressed like a punk band. Which is what Li Yang was going for. He says in hindsight the stuff he was listening to was...  Hardcore punk.  Punk rock.  But Kaiser notices that under this punk exterior...  They are wearing Iron Maiden t-shirts. I think that is ironic right? They are kind of making fun of Iron Maiden. Ha ha. That is very funny.  Because Iron Maiden is one of the classic heavy metal bands that plays these crazily technical songs with intricate guitar solos. Like punk and metal is just a total musical mismatch. But then later that day when it was Demerits slot to perform.   They get up and they start playing their songs. And they are like a you know punk major chords.  Exactly what Kaiser expected from a punk band.  Kind of brash bratty vocals.  But then part way through the song...  They bust into these dual guitar solos where they areyou know they are shredding in tight harmony.   It is this chimera of 70s US punk and 80s British metal.  And it is like whoa!   I thought in America there is no punk band that would bother to you know apply that much technique and a metal band that would have been okay with that aesthetic but it was great. It was like this is a music I could really get into. Andand so I talked to them I am asking So are not you guys punk?  Like how do you think about these genres that youre blending together?  And so...    They said We do not really care about that.    There was something freeing that he did nothe did not know what it all was and so he...    He did not have any rules. He could just make stuff.    Make music mixing everything together.    The way that he wanted to.  He was able to make music liberated from its own history its own expectations. And all across China other musicians were doing this same thing. Obliviously mixing rock with bebop with outlaw country with classical.  It was such an odd completely disembodied borrowing. It was free of context. Free of obligation. It was like taking a plant away from its soil dusting off any residue of the old soil and putting it in this totally different soil with a different pH level different level of the amount of sunlight. It is going to grow differently and it did.  It is sort of the mixtapeon the grandest of scales.  Exactly. Exactly. And the impact that it had on that generation was just utterly profound.    For him the biggest impact of dakou cassettes was not music it was about him finding a new way to think about the world.    Maybe he did not know he was searching for it but when he heard it he was like Oh!    Yeah that is me!    So dakou it was just like a little window.    And thenpew! Everything came rushing in.  Now what strikes me about all this more than anything is that were all sort of living in this world now. From spotify playlists that span eras and genres to the scatter shot of news we consume and then weave into our own understanding of whats happened. I mean our tastes our beliefs our realities are a collage. A mixtape of decontextualized and then recontextualized snippets. Next week were leaving China and going back to the moment this remixed existence began. Weve got the story of the first splice in our reality and the two men one you definitely know and one you most definitely dont who made it happen.  Mixtape is reported produced scored and sounded by me Simon Adler with original music throughout by me. Invaluable reporting and production assistance was provided by Eli Cohen. This episode also included original reporting from Noriko Ishigaki Rebecca Kanthor and our amazing anonymous Chinese reporter. Id like to take a moment to give thanks to Paul de Gay Juliette Kristensen Rebecca Tuhus-Dubrow Nick Lyons Michael Bull Jiro Ishikawa Hayley Zhao Megan Smalley and Deanne Totto. This episode would not have come together without each and every one of them. Weve got another tape for you next week.   Copyright  2021 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved.
