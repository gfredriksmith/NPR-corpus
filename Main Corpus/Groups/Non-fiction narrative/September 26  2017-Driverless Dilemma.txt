Oh wait you are listen .Okay.All right.Okay.All right.You are listen ...Listening ...To Radiolab. From ...WNYC.C?Yeah.Jad AbumradI am Jad Abumrad.Robert KrulwichI am Robert Krulwich and you know what this is.Jad AbumradIt is Radiolab .Robert KrulwichYeah.Jad AbumradOkay so we are going to play you a little bit of tape first just to set up the ... what we are going to do today. About a month ago we were doing the thing about the fake news.Robert KrulwichYeah we were really worried about a lot of fake news. A lot of people are. But in the middle of doing that report and we we were talking with a fellow from Vanity Fair.Nick BiltonMy name is Nick Bilton. I am a special correspondent for Vanity Fair. Robert KrulwichAnd in the course of our conversation Nick ... And this had nothing to do with what we were talking about by the way ... Nick just got into a sort of a well he went into a kind of nervous reverie I would say.Jad AbumradYeah he was like You know you guys want to talk about fake news but that is not actually what is eating at me.Nick BiltonThe thing that I have been pretty obsessed with lately is actually not fake news but it is automation and artificial intelligence and um and driverless cars. Because it is going to have a larger effect on society than any technology that I think has ever been created in the history of mankind. I know that is kind of a bold statement but-Jad AbumradJad AbumradQuite bold.Nick BiltonUh but you got to imagine that you know that there will be in the next 10 years 20 to 50 million jobs that will just vanish at automation. Um you have got you know million truckers that will lose their jobs um uh the ... But it is not ... We think about like automation and driverless cars and we think about the fact that uh they are going to uh ... The people that just drive the cars like the taxi drivers and the truckers are going to lose their jobs.Nick BiltonWhat we do not realize is that there are entire industries that are built around just cars. So for example if you are not driving the car why do you need insurance? There is no parking tickets because you are driverless car know where it can and cannot park and goes and finds a spot and moves and so on.Nick BiltonIf there are truckers that are no longer using rest stops because driverless cars do not have to stop and pee or take a nap then all of those little rest stops all across America are affected. People are not stopping to use the restrooms. They are not buying burgers. They are not staying in these hotels and so on and so forth.Nick BiltonAnd and then if you look driverless cars to a next level the whole concept of what a car is is going to change. And so for example right now a car has five seats and a wheel but if I am not driving what is the point of having five seats and a wheel? You could imagine that you take different cars so maybe when I was on my way here to this interview I wanted to work out so I called a driverless gym car. Or I have a meeting out in Santa Monica after this and it is an hour so I call a movie car to watch a movie on the way out there. Or office car and I pick up someone else and we have a meeting on the way.Nick BiltonAll of these things are going to happen not in a vacuum but simultaneously. This you know ... Pizza delivery drivers are gonna be replaced by robots that will actually cook your pizza on the way to your house in a little box and then deliver it.Nick BiltonAnd so kind of a little bit of a long-winded answer but I- I truly do think that um that it is gonna have a massive massive effect on society.Nick BiltonAm am I stressing you guys out? Are you are you having heart palpitations over there?Jad AbumradYeah yeah my blood pressure has gone up.Robert KrulwichThis is not good. This is not good.Robert KrulwichSo that is a fairly compelling description of a of a um of a very dangerous future.Jad AbumradYes but you know what? It is funny. Uh one of the thing that ... I mean we could not use that tape initially at least.Robert KrulwichRight.Jad AbumradBut we kept thinking about it because it actually weirdly points us back to a story we did about a decade ago. The story of a moral problem that is about to get totally reimagined.Robert KrulwichIt may be that what Nick is worried about and what we were worried about 10 years ago have now come dangerously close together.Jad AbumradSo what we thought we would do is we are we are going to play you the story as we did it then sort of the full segment. And then we are going to amend it on the back end.Jad AbumradAnd by way of just disclaiming this was at a moment in our development where there is just like way too many sound effects just gratuitous.Robert KrulwichWell you do not have to apologize for it. Those were great sound effects.Jad AbumradNo I am I am gonna apologize 'ecause there is just too much.Robert KrulwichJad AbumradJust too much. And also like we we we talk about the fMRI machine like it is this like amazing thing  when it was it is sorta commonplace now.Jad AbumradAnyhow it does not matter. We are going to play it for you and then talk about it on the back end. This is ...Jad AbumradWe start with a description of something called the trolley problem. You ready?Robert KrulwichYep.Jad AbumradAll right. You are gonna hear some train tracks. Go there in your mind.Robert KrulwichOkay.Jad AbumradThere are five workers on the tracks working. They have got their backs turned to the trolley which is coming in the distance.Robert KrulwichYou mean they are repairing the tracks?Jad AbumradThey are repairing the tracks.Robert KrulwichThis is unbeknownst to them the trolley is approaching?Jad AbumradThey do not see it. You cannot shout to them.Robert KrulwichOkay.Jad AbumradAnd if you do nothing here's what will happen. Five workers will die.Robert KrulwichOh my god . I ... That was a horrible experience. I do not want that to happen to them.Jad AbumradNo you do not. But you have a choice. You can do A nothing. Or B it so happens next to you is a lever. Pull the lever and the trolley will jump onto some side tracks where there is only one person working.Robert KrulwichSo if the  ... So if the trolley goes on the second track it will kill the one guy.Jad AbumradYeah so there is your choice. Do you kill one man by pulling a lever or do you kill five men by doing nothing?Robert KrulwichWell I am gonna pull the lever.Jad AbumradNaturally. All right here's part two.Jad AbumradYou are standing near some train tracks. Five guys are on the tracks just as before and there is the trolley coming.Robert KrulwichI hear the train coming in the ... The five same same five guys working on the track?Jad AbumradSame five guys.Robert KrulwichBacks to the train they cannot see anything?Jad AbumradYeah yeah exactly.Jad AbumradHowever I am gonna make a couple changes. Now you are standing on a footbridge that passes over the tracks. You are looking down onto the tracks. There is no lever anywhere to be seen except next to you there is a guy.Robert KrulwichWhat do you mean there is a guy?Jad AbumradA large guy large individual standing next to you on the bridge looking down with you over the tracks and you realize Wait I can save those five workers if I push this man give him a little tap.Jad AbumradJad AbumradHe will land on the tracks and stop the tr-Robert KrulwichAnd he stops the train.Jad AbumradRight.Robert KrulwichOh yeah I am not gonna do that. I am not gonna do that.Jad AbumradBut surely you realize the math is the same.Robert KrulwichYou mean I will save four people this way?Jad AbumradYeah.Robert KrulwichYeah but I am ... This time I am pushing the guy. Are you insane? No.Jad AbumradAll right here's the thing. If you ask people these questions and we did starting with the first.Jad AbumradIs it okay to kill one man to save five using a lever? 9 out of 10 people will say ...Yes.Yes .Yes.Yes.Yeah.Jad AbumradBut if you ask them Is it okay to kill one man to save five by pushing the guy? 9 out of 10 people will say ...No.No.Never.No.No.Jad AbumradIt is practically universal. And the thing is if you ask people Why is it okay to murder because that is what it is murder a man with a lever and not okay to do it with your hands people do not really know.Pulling the lever to save the five ... I do not know. That feels better than pushing the one to save the five. But I do not really know why so that is a good ... There is a good moral quandary for you .Robert KrulwichAnd if having a moral sense is a unique and special human quality then maybe we we us two humans anyway you and me-Jad AbumradYeah.Robert Krulwich... should at least inquire as to why this happens. And I happen to have met somebody who has a hunch.Robert KrulwichHe is a young guy at Princeton University wild curly hair bit of mischief in his eye. His name is Josh Greene.Josh GreeneAlrighty.Robert KrulwichAnd he spent the last few years trying to figure out where this inconsistency comes from.Josh GreeneHow do people make this judgment? Forget whether or not these judgements are right or wrong. Just what is going on in the brain that makes people distinguish so naturally and intuitively between these two cases which from an actuarial point of view are very very very similar if not identical?Robert KrulwichJosh is by the way a philosopher and a neuroscientist so this gives him special powers. He does not sort of sit back in a chair smoke a pipe and think Now why do you have these differences?Robert KrulwichHe says No I would like to look inside people's heads because in our heads we may find clues as to where these feelings of revulsion or acceptance come from. In our brains.Josh GreeneUh so we are here in the control room. We basically just see is uh Robert KrulwichAnd just so happens that in the basement of Princeton there was this um well ...Robert KrulwichA big circular thing.Josh GreeneYeah it looks kind of like an airplane engine.Robert Krulwich180000 pound brain scanner.Josh GreeneI will tell you a funny story. You cannot have any metal in there because of the magnet so we have this long list of questions that we ask people to make sure they can go it. Do you have a pacemaker? Have you ever worked with metal? Blah blah blah blah blah...Robert KrulwichHave you ever worked with metal?Josh GreeneYeah 'ecause you could have little flecks of metal in your eyes that you would never even know are there from having done metalworking.Oh my god totally Josh GreeneAnd one of the questions is whether or not you wear a wig or anything like that because they often have metal wires in with that.Josh GreeneAnd there is this very nice woman who does brain research here who is Italian and she is asking her subjects over the phone all all these screening questions.Josh GreeneAnd so I have this person over to dinner. She says Yeah you know I ended up uh doing this study but it asks you the weirdest questions. This woman's like 'Do you have a hairpiece?' And  and I am like 'What does it have to do if I have herpes or not?'Josh GreeneJosh GreeneAnd I want to say  ... Anyway and she said you know she asked Do you have a hairpiece? But she uh so now she asks people if you wear a wig or whatever. Robert KrulwichAnyhow what Josh does is he invites people into this room has them lie down on what is essentially a cot on rollers and he rolls them into the machine. Their heads are braced. They are sort of stuck in there.Robert KrulwichHave you ever done this?Josh GreeneOh yeah yep several times.Robert KrulwichAnd then he tells them stories. He tells them the same two you know trolley tales that you told before.Jad AbumradMm-hmm .Robert KrulwichAnd then at the very instant that they are deciding whether I should push the lever or whether I should push the man at that instant the scanner snaps pictures of their brains.Robert KrulwichAnd what he found in those pictures was frankly a little startling. Uh he showed us some.Josh GreeneI- I al- all right I will show you some some some stuff.Josh GreeneOkay let me think.Robert KrulwichTh- The picture that I am looking at is a sort of a it is it is a brain looked at I guess from the top-down.Josh GreeneYep it is top-down. It is sort of sliced you know like like like a deli slice or ...Robert KrulwichAnd the first slide that he showed me was a human brain being asked the question would you pull the lever and the answer in most cases was Yes.Yeah I would pull the lever.Robert KrulwichWhen the brain's saying Yes you would see little kind of peanut-shaped spots of yellow.Josh Greene ... this little guy right here and these two guys right there. Robert KrulwichThe brain was being active in these places and oddly enough whenever people said Yes.Yes yes.Robert Krulwich... to the lever question the very same pattern lit up.Robert KrulwichThen he showed me another slide. This is a slide of a brain saying No.No I would not push the man.Robert KrulwichI will not push the large man. And in this picture ...Josh GreeneThis one we are looking at here this ...Robert KrulwichIt was a totally different constellation of regions that lit up.Robert KrulwichThis is the No no no crowd.Josh GreeneI think this is part of the No no no crowd.Jad AbumradSo when people answer Yes to the lever question there are there are places in their brain which glow?Robert KrulwichRight but wh- when they answer No I will not push the man then you get a completely different part of the brain lighting up.Jad AbumradEven though the questions are basically the same?Robert KrulwichMm-hmm .Jad AbumradWhat does that mean? What does Josh make of this?Robert KrulwichWell he has a theory about this.Josh GreeneA theory not proven but I think ... Th- th- this is what I think the evidence suggests.Robert KrulwichHe suggests that the human brain does not hum along like one big unified system. Instead he says maybe in your brain every brain you find little uh warring tribes little subgroups. One that is sort of doing the logical sort of counting kind of thing.Josh GreeneYou have got one part of the brain that says Huh five lives versus one life? Would not it better to save five versus one?Robert KrulwichAnd that is the part that would glow when you answer Yes I would pull the lever.Yeah I would pull the lever.Robert KrulwichBut there is this other part of the brain which really really does not like personally killing another human being and gets very upset at the fat man case and shouts in effect ...No!No!Josh GreeneIt it understands it on that level and says ...No!No!Josh GreeneNo bad do not do.No I do not think I could push ...No.Never.... a person.No.Josh GreeneInstead of having sort of one system that just sort of churns out the answer and bing we have multiple systems that give different answers and they duke it out. And hopefully out of that competition comes morality.Robert KrulwichThis is not a trivial discovery that you struggle to find right and wrong depending on what part of your brain is shouting the loudest. This is ... It is like bleachers morality.Jad AbumradDo you buy this?Robert KrulwichHm. Uh you know I- I just do not know.Jad AbumradYeah.Robert KrulwichI have always kinda suspected that a sense of right and wrong is mostly stuff that you get from your mom and your dad and from experience that it is culturally-learned for the most part.Robert KrulwichJosh is kind of a radical in this respect. He thinks it is biological. I mean deeply biological that somehow we inherit from the deep past a sense of right and wrong that is already in our brains from the get-go before Mom and Dad.Josh GreeneOur our primate ancestors before we were full-blown humans had intensely social lives. They have social mechanisms that prevent them from doing all the nasty things that they might otherwise be interested in doing.Josh GreeneAnd so deep in our brain we have what you might call basic primate morality. And basic primate morality does not understand things like tax evasion but it does understand things like pushing your buddy off of a cliff.Robert KrulwichOh so you are think then if the man on the bridge that I am on the bridge next to the large man and then I have hundreds of thousands of years of training in my brain that says Do not murder the large man.Josh GreeneRight. Whereas-Robert KrulwichEven if I am thinking If I murder the large man I am gonna save five lives and only kill the one man but there is something deeper down that says Do not murder the large man.Josh GreeneRight.Josh GreeneNow that case I think it is a pretty easy case. Even though it is five versus one in that case people just go with what we might call the inner chimp. But there are other but there-Robert KrulwichThe inner chimp is your unfortunate way of describing an act of an act of deep goodness.Josh GreeneR- R- Right well that is what is interesting.Robert KrulwichThou shalt ... Let us have 10 Commandments for God ... Inner chimp ...Josh GreeneRight well ... Right Well what is interesting is that we think of of basic human morality as being handed down from on high and it is probably better to say that it was handed up from below that our most basic core moral values are not the things that we humans have invented but the things that we have actually inherited from other people. The stuff that we humans have invented are the things that seem more peripheral and variable. But-Robert KrulwichSomething as basic as Thou shalt not kill which many people think was handed down in tablet form from a mountaintop from God directly to humans no chimps involved ...Josh GreeneRight.Robert KrulwichYou are suggesting that hundreds of thousands of years of on-the-ground training have gotten our brains to think Do not kill your kin. Do not kill your-Josh GreeneRight or at least you know that should be your default response. I mean certainly chimpanzees are extremely violent and they do kill each other but they do not do it as a matter of of course. They so to speak have to have some context-sensitive reason for doing so. Uh-Robert KrulwichSo now we are getting to the rub of it. You think that profound moral positions may be somehow embedded in brain chemistry.Josh GreeneUm yeah.Jad AbumradAnd Josh thinks uh there are times when these different moral positions that we have embedded inside of us in our brains when they can come into conflict. And in the original episode we went into one more story. This one you might call the crying baby dilemma.Jad AbumradTh- The situation uh is somewhat similar to th- the last episode of MASH for people who are familiar with that. But the way we tell the story it goes like this.Jad AbumradIt is wartime...There is an enemy patrol coming down the road.Jad AbumradYou are hiding in the basement with some of your fellow villagers.Let us kill those lights.Jad AbumradAnd the enemy soldiers are outside. They have orders to kill anyone that they find.Quiet! Nobody make a sound until they have passed us.Robert KrulwichSo there you are. You are huddled in the basement all around you are enemy troops and you are holding your baby in your arms your baby with a cold a bit of a sniffle. And you know that your baby could cough at any moment.Jad AbumradIf they hear your baby they are going to find you and the baby and everyone else and they are going to kill everybody. And the only way you can stop this from happening is cover the baby's mouth.Jad AbumradBut if you do that the baby's going to smother and die. If you do not cover the baby's mouth the soldiers are gonna find everybody and everybody's gonna be killed including you including your baby.Robert KrulwichAnd you have the choice. Would you smother your own baby to save the village or would you let your baby cough knowing the consequences?Jad AbumradAnd this is a very tough question. People take a long time to think about it and some people say yes and some people say no.Children are a blessing and a gift from God and we do not do that to children.Yes I think I would kill my baby to save everyone else and myself.No I would not kill the baby.I feel because it is my baby I have the right to terminate the life. Um ... so yeah.I would like to say that I would kill the baby but I do not know if I would have the inner strength.No. If it comes down to killing my own child my own daughter or my own son then I choose death.Yeah. If you have to 'ecause it was done in World War II. When the Germans were coming around there was a mother that had a baby that was crying and rather than be found she actually suffocated the baby but the other people lived.Sounds like an old MASH thing. No you do not kill your baby.Robert KrulwichIn the final MASH episode the Korean woman who is a character in this piece she murders her baby.She killed it. She killed it. Oh my god oh my god. I did not mean for her to kill it. I did not ... I- I just wanted it to be quiet. It was it was a baby. She she smothered her own baby.Robert KrulwichWhat Josh did is he asked people the question Would you murder your own child? while they were in the brain scanner. And at just the moment when they were trying to decide what they would do he took pictures of their brain.Robert KrulwichAnd what he saw the contest we described before was global in the brain. It was like a world war.Robert KrulwichThat gang of accountants that part of the brain was busy calculating calculating. The whole village could die the whole village could die.Robert KrulwichBut the older and deeper reflex also was lit up shouting Do not kill the baby! No no! Do not kill the baby!No!No!Robert KrulwichInside the brain was literally divided. Do the calculations do not kill the baby. Do the calculations do not kill the baby.Robert KrulwichTwo different tribes in the brain literally trying to shout each other out.Robert KrulwichAnd Jad this was a different kind of contest than the one's we talked about before. Remember before when people were pushing the man off the bridge overwhelmingly their brains yelled No no do not push the man!Robert KrulwichAnd when people were pulling the lever overwhelmingly Yeah yeah pull the lever!Jad AbumradRight.Robert KrulwichThere was distinct. Here I do not think really anybody wins.Jad AbumradWell who breaks the tie? I mean they had to answer something right?Robert Krulwich Well that is a good question.Robert KrulwichAnd now is there a... Do... What happens? Is it just two cries that fight each other out or is there a judge?Josh GreeneWell that is an interesting question. And that is one of the things that we are looking at.Robert KrulwichWhen you are in this moment with parts of your brain contesting there are two brain regions ...Josh GreeneThese two areas here towards the front ...Robert Krulwich... right behind your eyebrows left and right that light up. And this is particular to us. He showed me a slide.Josh GreeneUh it is those uh sort of area that are very highly developed in humans as compared to other species.Robert KrulwichSo when we have a problem that we need to deliberate over the light ... The front of the brain this is above my eyebrow sort of?Josh GreeneYeah right about there.Robert KrulwichAnd there is two of them one on the left one on the right.Josh GreeneBilateral.Robert KrulwichAnd they are the things that monkeys do not have as much of that we have?Josh GreeneCertainly these parts of the brain are more highly developed in humans.Robert KrulwichSo looking at these two flashes of light at the front of a human brain you could say we are looking at what makes us special.Josh GreeneTh- That is a fair statement.Robert KrulwichA human being wrestling with a problem that is what that is.Josh GreeneYeah where it is both emotional but there is also a sort of a rational attempt to sort of sort through those emotions those are the cases that are showing more activity in that area.Jad AbumradSo in those cases when these dots above our eyebrows become active what are they doing?Robert KrulwichWell he does not know for sure but what he found is in this close contexts whenever those nodes are very very active it appears that the calculating section of the brain gets a bit of a boost and the visceral inner chimp section of the brain is kind of muffled.No! No. No ...Robert KrulwichThe people who chose to kill their children who made what is essentially a logical decision over and over those subjects had brighter glows in these two areas and longer glows in these two areas so there is a definite association between these two dots above the eyebrow and the power of the logical brain over the inner chimp or the visceral brain.Josh GreeneWell you know that is the hypothesis. Well it is gonna take a lot of more research to sort of tease apart what these different parts of the brain are doing or if some of these are just sort of activated in an incidental kind of way. I mean we really do not know. This is all all very new.Jad AbumradOkay so that was the story we put together many many many years ago about a decade ago. Uh and at that point the whole idea of thinking of morality as kind of purely a brain thing it was relatively new. And certainly the idea of philosophers working with fMRI machines it was super new.Jad AbumradBut now here we are 10 years later and uh some updates. Uh first of all Josh Greene ...Robert KrulwichSo in the in the long long stream of time I assume now you have uh three giraffes two bobcats and children?Josh GreeneThat is right. Yeah so two kids and we- we are close to adding a cat. Jad AbumradWe talked to him again. He has started a family. He is switched labs from Princeton to Harvard.Jad AbumradBut that whole time that interim decade he has still been thinking and working on the trolley problem.Robert KrulwichDid you ever write the story differently?Josh GreeneAbsolutely so Jad AbumradFor years he is been trying out different permutations of the scenario on people.Josh Greene... by fire push one of your colleagues in ...Jad AbumradLike Okay instead of pushing the guy off the bridge with your hands what if you did it but not with your hands?Josh GreeneSo in one version we ask people about hitting a switch that opens a trapdoor on the footbridge and drops the person. In one version of that the switch is right next to the person. In another the switch is far away. And in yet another version you are right next to the person and you do not push them off with your hands but you push them with a pole.Robert KrulwichOh ...Josh GreeneJad AbumradAnd to cut to the chase uh what Josh has found is that the basic results that we talked about ...Josh GreeneThat is roughly held up. Jad AbumradStill the case that people would like to save the most number of lives but not if it means pushing somebody with their own hands or with a pole for that matter.Jad AbumradNow here's something kind of interesting. Uh he and  found that there are two groups that are more willing to push the guy off the bridge. They are Buddhist monks and psychopaths.Josh GreeneI mean some people just do not care very much about hurting other people. They do not have that kind of an emotional response. Jad AbumradThat would the psychopaths whereas the Buddhist monks presumably are really good at shushing their inner chimp as he called to it and just saying to themselves ...Josh GreeneYou know I am aware that this is ... that killing somebody is a terrible thing to do and I feel that but I recognize that this is done for a noble reason and therefore it is it is it is okay.Jad AbumradSo there is all kinds of interesting things you can say about the trolley problem as a thought experiment but at the end of the day it is just that. It is a thought experiment. What got us interested in revisiting it is that it seems like the thought experiment is about to get real.Jad AbumradThat is coming up right after the break.Amanda DarbyThis is Amanda Darby calling from Rockville Maryland.

Subscribe wherever you get your podcasts.Jad AbumradJad Robert Radiolab. Okay so where we left it is that the trolley problem is about to get real. Here's how Josh Greene put it.Josh GreeneYou know now as we are entering the age of self-driving cars ah this is like the trolley problem now finally come to life.Oh there is cars coming! Oh-The future of the automobile is here.Oh there is cars! Ah-Autonomous vehicles. It is here.The first self-driving Volvo will be offered to customers in 2021.... never. Ah ah! Oh where is it going This legislation is the first of its kind focused on the car of the future that is more of a supercomputer on wheels.Oh! Oh there is a car coming! Jad AbumradOkay so self-driving cars unless you have been living under a muffler they are coming. It is going to be a little bit of an adjustment for some of us.Ah!Hit the brakes hit the brakes.No Jad AbumradBut what Josh meant when he said it is the trolley problem ...Josh Greene... come to life ...Jad Abumrad... is basically this.Jad AbumradImagine this scenario.Josh GreeneThe self-driving car now is uh headed towards a bunch of pedestrians in the road. The only way to save them is to swerve out of the way but that will run the car into a concrete wall and it will kill the passenger in the car.Josh GreeneUh what should the car do? Should the car go straight and run over say those five people or should it swerve and and and and kill the one person?Jad AbumradThat suddenly is a real-world question.Josh GreeneIf you ask people in the abstract... Jad Abumrad... like what theoretically should a car in this situation do ... Josh GreeneThey are much more likely to say ...I think you should sacrifice one for the good of the many.Josh GreeneThey should just try to the most good or avoid the most harm.Jad AbumradSo if it is between one driver and five pedestrians ...Logically it would be the driver.Kill the um driver.Be selfless.I think it should kill the driver.Jad AbumradBut when you ask people forget the theory ...Josh GreeneWould you want to drive in a car that would potentially sacrifice you to save the lives of more people in order to minimize the total amount of harm? They say ...No.I would not buy it.No.Absolutely not.That would kill me in it? No.So I am not gonna I am not gonna buy a car that is gonna purposely kill me.Hell no. I would not buy it. For sure no .I would sell it but I would not buy it.Thank you very much. Have a good evening.Jad AbumradSo there is your problem. People would sell a car and an idea of moral reasoning that they themselves would not buy. And last fall an exec at Mercedes Benz face-planted right into the middle of this contradiction.Welcome to Paris one of the most beautiful cities in the world and welcome to the 2016 Paris Motor Show home to some of the most beautiful cars in the world. Jad AbumradOkay October 2016 the Paris Motor Show. You had something like a million people coming in over the course of a few days. All the major car-makers were there.Here is Ferrari. You can see the LaFerrari Aperta and of course the new GT4CLusso T. Jad AbumradEverybody was debuting their new cars. And uh one of the big presenters in this whole affair was this guy.Christoph von In the future you will have cars where you do not even have to have your hands on the steering wheel anymore but maybe you watch a movie on the head-up display or maybe you want to do your emails. That is really what we are striving for.Jad AbumradThis is Christoph von Hugo a senior safety manager at Mercedes Benz. He was at the show sort of demonstrating a prototype of a car that could sort of self-drive its way through traffic.Christoph von In this E-Class today for example you have a maximum of comfort and support systems.You will actually look forward to being stuck in traffic jams will not you?Christoph von Of course of course. Jad AbumradHe was doing dozens and dozens of interviews through the show and in one of those interviews ... Unfortunately this one we do not have on tape ... He was asked What would your driverless car do in a trolley problem-type dilemma where maybe you have to choose between one or many? Jad AbumradAnd he answered quote ...Michael TaylorIf you know you can save one person at least save that one.Jad AbumradIf you know you can save one person save that one person.Michael TaylorSave the one in the car.Jad AbumradThis is Michael Taylor correspondent for Car and Driver magazine. He was the one that Christoph von Hugo said that to.Michael TaylorIf you know for sure that one thing one life can be prevented and that is your first priority.Amanda AronczykNow when he said this to you ...Jad AbumradThis is producer Amanda Aronczyk.Amanda Aronczyk... Did it seem controversial at all in the moment?Michael TaylorIn the moment it seemed incredibly logical.Jad AbumradI mean all he is really doing is saying what is on people's minds which is that ...No.I- I would not buy it personally Jad AbumradWho is gonna buy a car that chooses somebody else over them?Jad AbumradAnyhow he makes that comment Michael prints it and a kerfuffle ensues.Save the one in the car. That is Christoph von Hugo from Mercedes ...But then when you lay out the questions you sound like a bit of a heel because you want to save yourself as opposed to the pedestrians.Does not it ring though of like just privilege you know?It does yeah it does.  wait a second. What would you do? It is you or a pedestrian. And it is just you know I do not know anything about this pedestrian. It is just you or a pedestrian just a regular guy walking down the street.Ah screw everyone who is not in a Mercedes.Josh GreeneAnd there was this kind of uproar about that uh how dare you drive these selfish you know make these selfish cars? Uh and then he walked it back and he said No no what I mean is that uh just that we th- that we have a better chance of protecting the people in the car so we are going to protect them because they are easier to protect.Josh GreeneBut of course you know there is always gonna be trade-offs.Robert KrulwichYeah.Jad AbumradAnd those trade-offs could get really really tricky and subtle. Because obviously these cars have sensors.Raj RajkumarSensors like uh cameras radars lasers and ultrasound sensors.Jad AbumradThis is Raj Rajkumar. He is a professor at Carnegie Mellon.Raj RajkumarI am the uh co-director of the GM-CMU Connected and Autonomous Driving Collaborative Research Lab.Jad AbumradHe is one of the guys that is writing the code that will go inside GM's uh driverless car. He says Yeah the sensors at the moment on these cars ...Raj RajkumarStill evolving ...Jad AbumradPretty basic.Raj RajkumarWe are very happy if today it can actually detect a pedestrian can detect a bicyclist a motorcyclist. Different makers have different shapes sizes and colors.Jad AbumradBut he says it will not be long before ...Raj RajkumarYou can actually know a lot more about uh who these people are Jad AbumradEventually they will be able to detect people of different sizes shapes and colors. Like oh that is a skinny person that is a small person tall person black person white person. That is a little boy that is a little girl.Jad AbumradSo forget the basic moral math. Like what does a car do if it has to decide oh do I save this boy or this girl? What about two girls versus one boy and an adult? How about a cat versus a dog? A 75-year-old guy in a suit versus that person over there who might be homeless? You can see where this is going.Jad AbumradAnd it is conceivable that cars will know our medical records and back at the car show ...We have also heard that term car-to-car communication.Christoph von Well that is uh also one of the enabling technologies in highly- uh automated driving. Jad AbumradMercedes guy basically said in a couple of years the cars will be networked. They will be talking to each other. So just imagine a scenario where like cars are about to get into accidents and right at the decision point they are like conferring.Jad AbumradWell who do you have in your car?Jad AbumradMe I got a 70-year-old Wall Street guy makes eight figures. How about you?Jad AbumradWell I am a bus full of kids. Kids have more years left. You need to move.Jad AbumradWell hold up. I see that your kids come from a poor neighborhood and have asthma so I do not know ...Raj RajkumarSo you can basically uh tie yourself up in uh knots uh wrap yourself around an axle. We do not think that any programmer should be given this uh major uh burden of deciding who survives and who gets killed.Raj RajkumarI think these are uh very fundamental deep uh issues that society has to decide at large. I do not think a programmer uh eating pizza and sipping Coke should be making the call.Jad Abumrad How does society decide? I mean help me imagine that.Raj RajkumarI think it really has to be an evolutionary process I believe.Jad AbumradRaj told us that two things basically need to happen. First we need to get these robocars on the road get more experience with how they interact with us human drivers and how we interact with them. And two there need to be like industry-wide summits.Bill Ford Jr.No one company is going to solve that. Jad AbumradThis is Bill Ford Jr. of the Ford company uh giving a speech in October of 2016 at the Economic Club of D.C.Bill Ford Jr.And we have to have ... Because could you imagine if we had one algorithm and Toyota had another and General Motors had another? I mean it would be ... I mean obviously you could not do that. Jad Abumrad'ecause like what if the Tibetan cars make one decision and the American cars make another?Bill Ford Jr.So we need to have a national discussion on ethics I think uh because we have never had to think of these things before but the cars will have the time and the ability to do that. Jad AbumradSo far Germany is the only country that we know of that has tackled this head-on.One of the most significant points the ethics commission made is that autonomous and connected driving is an ethical imperative. Jad AbumradThey ... The government has released a code of ethics that says among other things self-driving cars are forbidden to discriminate between humans in almost any way. Not on race not on gender not on age nothing. ... says priorities like these should not be programmed into the cars. Raj RajkumarOne can imagine uh a few clauses being added uh in the Geneva Convention if you will of what these automated vehicles should do. A globally-accepted standard if you will.Jad AbumradHow we get there to that globally-accepted standard is anyone's guess. And what it will look like whether it will be like a coherent set of rules or like rife with the kind of contradictions we see in our own brain that also remains to be seen. But one thing is clear.Oh there is cars coming! Oh oh there is cars! Ah Jad AbumradOh there are cars coming.Feel this-Jad AbumradWith their questions. control it. Oh dear Jesus I could never ah! Ah! Oh where is it going! Goddamn Bill. Oh my god. Jad AbumradOkay we do need to caveat all this by saying that the moral dilemma we are talking about in the case of these driverless cars is gonna be super rare.Jad AbumradMostly what will probably happen is that like the planeloads of people that die every day from car accidents well that is just gonna hit the floor. And so you have to balance the few cases where a car might make a decision you do not like against the massive number of lives saved.Robert KrulwichI was thinking actually of a different thing. I was thinking even though you dramatically bring down the number of bad things that happen on road ... You dramatically bring down the collisions you dramatically bring down the mortality you dramatically lower the number of people who are drunk coming home from a party and just ram someone sideways and killing three of them and injuring two of them for the rest of their lives.Robert KrulwichThose kinds of things go way down but th- the ones that remain are engineered. Like they are calculated uh almost with foresight.Jad AbumradMm-hmm .Robert KrulwichSo here's the difference. And this is just an interesting difference like Ah damn that is so sad that happened. That that guy got drunk and dadada and maybe he should go to jail.Robert KrulwichBut You mean that the society engineered this in?Jad AbumradRobert KrulwichThat is a big difference. One is operatic and seems like the forces of destiny and the other seems mechanical and pre-thought through.Jad AbumradPremeditated yeah.Robert KrulwichAnd there is something dark about a premeditated expected death. And I do not know what you do about that.Jad AbumradWell yeah but in-Robert KrulwichEverybody's on the hook for that.Jad AbumradIn the particulars in the particulars it feels dark. It is a little bit like when you know should you kill your own baby to save the village.Robert KrulwichOkay.Jad AbumradLike in the particular of that one child it is dark. But against the backdrop of the lives saved it is just a tiny pinprick of darkness. That is all it is.Robert KrulwichYeah but you know how humans are. If you argue back that yes a bunch of smartypantses concocted a mathematical formula which meant that some people had to die and here they are there are many fewer than before! A human being just like Josh would tell you would have a roar of feeling and of anger and saying How dare you engineer this in! No no no no no!Jad AbumradAnd that human being needs to meditate like the monks to silence that feeling because the feeling in that case is just getting in the way!Robert KrulwichYes and no. And that may be impossible unless you are a monk for God's sake.Jad AbumradSee we are right back where we started now. All right we should go.Robert KrulwichJad you have to thank some people no?Jad AbumradYes oh uh this piece was produced by Amanda Aronczyk with help from Bethel Habte. Special thanks to  Edmond Awad and Sydney Levine from The Moral Machine Group MIT. Also thanks to Sertac Karaman Xin Xiang and Roborace for all their help.Jad AbumradAnd I guess we should go now.Robert KrulwichYeah. I will um-Jad AbumradI am Jad Abumrad.Robert KrulwichI am not getting into your car.Jad AbumradRobert KrulwichIf you do not mind. Just take my own.Jad AbumradI am going to rig up an autonomous vehicle to the bottom of your bed.Jad AbumradJad AbumradSo you are going to go to bed and suddenly find yourself on the highway driving you wherever I want.Robert Krulwich No you will not.Jad AbumradAnyhow uh okay we should go.Robert KrulwichYeah.Jad AbumradI am Jad Abumrad.Robert KrulwichI am Robert Krulwich.Jad AbumradThanks for listening.Received today at 41 PM.Josh GreeneAll right.
