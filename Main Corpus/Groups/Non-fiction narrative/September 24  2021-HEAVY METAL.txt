     I am Latif Nasser. This is Radiolab. Today a story about how we humans rearrange the elemental stuff all around us and how one man's pursuit of a basic truth about the Earth revealed in an extraterrestrial explosion a 2000-year-old Peruvian skeleton even a strand of his lab assistant's hair changed the very air we breathe. It comes to us from reporter Avir Mitra.   So I guess we will start it ...     ... with this guy Clair Patterson. He goes by the name Pat.     This is from an oral history from 1995.         And so Pat's tribe ...     Did all the things you do growing up in the country.     But he washe was ...   This is science journalist Lydia Denworth.   He was in some ways a farm boy but ...     He was the kind of kid who asked his mother all kinds of questions about the world. Like ...     Things like that. He set up a chemistry lab in his basement when he was 12.   In high school he you know was always like ...     ... correcting his teachers.     He was just always always fascinated by how the world worked. And he had the ability to see beyond what others saw. You know he made leaps.   So like for example this is a kid from a small town. He goes to a small high school.   Yeah.   Small college. And graduates and his first job out of college he is working ...     For the Manhattan Project.   Oh wow.   Now to back up a little bit. At the beginning of World War II around 1940 there were these European scientists.   Like Einstein and others.   Who were immigrating to the US and telling anyone who would listen the Germans were making a bomb. An atomic bomb.   And they were pushing the Americans to make sure that they did not get behind the Germans.   And so when Pat graduated some of his professors pushed him ...     And help the American effort to create a nuclear bomb.   So Pat enlisted got shipped down to Oak Ridge Tennessee.   With his wife Laurie.   Laurie Patterson she was also a scientist. Brilliant chemist in fact. And also worked on the Manhattan Project. So anyway ...   And Oak Ridge was one of those places that they made a city overnight.   75000 people in the end were working and living there.     To these top secret state of the art laboratories.     And I do not think he knew what he would be doing when he got there but he ends up dead smack in the middle of the whole thing.   Like dead smack in the middle of the bomb?   Yeah. His job at Oak Ridge was to make the actual stuff in the bomb that goes boom which was uranium.   Hmm.   And uranium is an interesting characteran element really. It is the heaviest element that occurs naturally at least. So like you know every element is made up of three things protons neutrons and electrons.   Mm-hmm.   Protons and neutrons are in the middle. They are kind of what define the element. So every element has a different amount of these things. And uranium has the most of them. Like just to give you as an example hydrogen has a weight of one helium four carbon has like 12. But uranium's out here. It weighs 238. It is just huge.   Right.   All right? So that makes itand this is keyunstable. Because the thing you need to do with a nuclear bomb is to break an atom apart. And uranium? Like I think of uranium like a guy who is walking around with like a ton of grocery bags. You know he is just holding way too many bags.      You know walking from the grocery store back to his car and you know this dude's just not going to be able to make it. Along the way he is gonna drop a bag. And that is basically uranium. It is just too big. It is holding onto too many things. So now if that is just a couple uranium atoms mixed in with other atoms here or there it is no big deal. But if you can put a thousand uranium dudes in a parking lot overfilled with grocery bags and if you just like threw an apple at one of those guys or threw a grocery bag at one of those guys right?   Right.   That dude's gonna drop the bag. And then that bag is gonna fall and kind of tumble onto the guy next to him. He drops two bags. And then four dudes around him tumble and fall and just drop some more bags.   Right.   It is gonna set off a chain reaction basically. And that is where ...   Right.   ... shit gets nuclear. So Pat's job at Oak Ridge was to use this newfangled machine called the mass spectrometer. And what that does is it isolates different elements in regular rocks. So finding uranium in granite rocks. He is pulverizing these rocks isolating uranium purifying uranium. And he basically just spent two years doing this. And then August 6 1945.     The United States dropped the U bomb the uranium bomb.     When the bomb exploded temperatures on the ground reached over 7000 degrees Fahrenheit. Tens of thousands of people were killed instantly. And that is just from the energy of the explosion. But then what happens is something arguably more horrifying because when a uranium bomb explodes now there is all this uranium around just spewing out all these protons and neutrons. And even if you did not get killed by the bomb those protons and neutrons they are gonna go right into your body.     And if there is enough of it around it is literally gonna tear your body apart from the inside.     And that is exactly what happened in Hiroshima. Then we dropped a second bomb on Nagasaki.     Pat said you know as this 22-year-old kid straight out of college he never really fully understood the scope of what he was doing. And that thesethese mentors of his ...     After Japan surrenders you know Pat and his wife were given these commemorative pins that said Manhattan Project-A Bomb. And according to his wife they just threw them in the trash.   Soso what is that? Like is that regret or anger or shame? Or like ...   I think it was probably all of those things. I think he felt like this thing that had sort of inspired him and moved him and defined his life which was basically just like curiosity about the world understanding things had kind of been taken advantage of and sort of used to create this real horror. And so he just wanted to get away from all of that. I think he just wants to get back to doing science that is free of all of that.     But that is not quite how it worked out for him. So after the bomb project Pat and his wife Laurie move back to Chicago and he enrolls to get his chemistry PhD at the university there the University of Chicago.     And one day this professor comes up to him.     Look I am trying to answer a question. How old is this rock that were sitting on? Like how old is the Earth?   We did not know that?   No.   Nobody knew the age of the Earth.   People had been trying to guess at this for a long time.   It started with somebody adding up all the ages of everybody in the Bible.    Which got us to about like 6000 years old.   It is not right.    And then you know people start finding dinosaur fossils and it is like okay. Well I guess this has to be a little longer than that. But still no one knew exactly how much longer.   Hmm.     So Pat's professor says to him This is perfect for you its pure chemistry.         And then his professor said to him ...     It is gonna be duck soup. Which I guess is a way of saying it is easy.   That is mythat is my favorite Marx Brothers movie.   Duck Soup?   Yeah.   Hmm.   Anyway. Okay sorry. Keep going.   Okay so Pat's got this job now right? No making bombs it is just this pure scientific question. But the crazy thing is the key to answering this question is the same thing that caused all this horror in the atom bomb.   Okay.   So ...   Intrigued.   So basically uranium is sitting around in all these rocks on Earth doing its thing right? Over time it slowly drops a proton or neutron here or there. And since it is just mixed up in other rocks it is not a huge deal. But while it is not really hurting anyone it is doing something else it is decaying. It is actually changing into a different atom a different element. So over time really really slowly as it spits out protons and neutrons the uranium atom turns into like thorium then turns into radon and turns into bismuth. Ultimately it turns into lead. And lead is stable. So it is just gonna be lead forever as far as we know.   Mm-hmm.   And the thing about this decay is that it happens at a very predictable rate. It is very very slow but scientists figured out that like say if you start out with a rock that only had uranium when it was formed now if you look at the rock and you see I do not know a gram of lead you know how long it took to make that lead you could tell how long that rock's been around.   Got it.   That basically means that you have a super accurate clock hidden inside every rock.   Clock rocks.   Clock rocks.   Got it.   But the problem with rocks on Earth when you try to date them theyre just not good dates. No I am just kidding.      The thing about rocks is they ...   People look at you funny yeah.   Yeah it is just awkward you know? No but the problem is that you know when you figure out the age of that rock that is great but it just tells you the age of that specific rock. It just tells you how old that particular rock is. Like that is all you really know.   Yeah. How do you know that is the oldest rock or there is another rock that is even older? Or this one actually was just made yesterday in a volcano. Like who knows?   Yeah exactly. That is the problem. The Earth is just a chaotic place you know? And so somehow you need to get your hands on a rock that you know for sure formed at the same time as the Earth.    And how could you possibly do that?   Well what Pat had to do is go to the very center of an explosion that about a thousand times bigger that the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. Which happened thanks to nature actually. Not humans.   Okeedoke.   Out in the middle of this desert in northern Arizona. It is like red rocks flatlands. All you could see for miles.   All right here'soh all right.   I actually went there. Met up with this guy.   Hello!   Avir right?   That is right.   How is it going?   Hey.   Michael.   Michael Schwab. He is a tour guide.   So where do you want to do this? Do you want to go out toto Picture Rock all the way out there and do this?   Yeah I think that would be cool. Maybe we could just like walk and you could teach me.   Yeah absolutely. Follow me.   So yeah he walks me on this path. And we are walking and talking until we get to the edge of this ridgeline.   Oh my God!   And looked down into this huge crater.   Just imagine the biggest hole that you could ever possibly grasp and then just amplify that.   I do not know how to describe this because it really just looks like someone set off a bomb in the middle. And it is just a perfect circle.   Almost perfect circle yeah. It is difficult to describe in words.   And basically it is this huge crater in the middle of the desert that is almost a mile in diameter. And it is ...   If you put the Washington Monument down there at the bottom ...   ... deep.   ... we would actually be eye level with it.   No you gotta be kidding me.   Most people when they come out here do not even know what to do with themselves. They just sit in awe of it.   Actually went out talked to some people who were out there.   Big hole right?      It is kind of messing with my head a little bit.   It is scary.   Fascinating.   A lot of people can determine which way it got here but I see it as the Majesty of God's hand.   It is kind of a miracle how this crater got here. But to explain a couple of years before Patterson was going to answer this age of the Earth question astrophysicists had strong enough telescopes that they were able to look into the heavens and see how other solar systems had formed. And what they were seeing is that solar systems form at the same time.   Forms at the same time as what? As ...?   In other words like with our solar system you might think oh Jupiter formed first and then maybe Earth formed later.   Right.   But no. They all happened together.   Got it.   But one planet that should have become a planet for whatever reason did not clump together right. And it formed the asteroid belt.   Hmm.   And in that belt there was this big rock. About like 150 feet long half the size of a football field. And for countless years it was just hanging out floating in space. So it is just vacuum sealed in space not getting changed. And then one day another rock very gently tapped it. And that set it very slightly off of its course. And year after year after year its orbit is now bringing it ever so closer and closer to the sun.   Hmm.   And eventually 50000 years agoMike likes to imagine it was early summer ...   Yeah I like to say July 4 this thing hits. It is the best firework show ever.   So July 4 48000 BC.   Ice age.   This whole desert was grassland. And people hadnt even crossed the Bering Strait to get over here yet.   Right. So you had creatures like Melly the melancholy mammoth Sid the sloth.   And that day had they looked up they would have seen this huge flaming rock.   It would have looked like a great ball ofalmost like a bit of the sun came down.   Hurtling towards them very fast.   About 26000 miles per hour fast. And then next thing you knew ...   This flaming rock came falling out of the sky slammed into Earth in a huge fiery explosion.     Now when this meteor struck there was so much force that the meteor itself was just like disintegrated. Most of it disintegrated. But ...   In here we have a picture of the crater.   ... some of it survived the impact.   But we also have front and center the largest fragment of meteorite we have recovered from this site.   Wow!   And youre welcome to touch it as well.   Whoa okay yes. You were not lying. This isall right how big is this thing like in terms of size?   This thing is about three feet in length. So the first thing you will actually notice is that it is not totally smooth.   It looks like Swiss cheese.   It looks like Swiss cheese.   Kind of looks like an arrowhead type of shape.   Or as I am looking at it now it kind of looks like a lopsided dinosaur skull.   Yeah it does look like a dinosaur skull.   But arguably my favorite thing is that people worry all the time like Oh does not anybody try to steal this?   Right. Because I am considering it.   If you tried to pick it up and somehow you bring it back to your car you can have it. Because it weighs 1406 pounds.   This three foot thing?   Weighs just under a ton.   You gotta be kidding me.   Mm-mm.   Do you mind if I try to lift it?   Absolutely.   All right here holdhere let us put this down here. Hold this and point it at me. All right. Okay I doI have been doing squats and deadlifts so ...   Good luck.   I just want to give you a heads-up that I may be the one.   Good luck.   All right so I am just gonna put my arms around this thing.   Okay.      It is a very futile effort folks. It is just not happening.    Holy crap. I cannot even budge it.   No you cannot. But ...   Can we try together? No? All right. All right.   Okay so now how is this gonna help Pat determine the age of the Earth?   Well he knows that this rock formed at the same time as the Earth. It is been perfectly preserved in space and ...     Oh my God it sings!   Yeah.   Whoa.    it is metal.     This is a solid piece of metal.   Yep. 92 percent iron and 7 percent nickel. And then that last one percent is 80 other trace elements.   Including lead.   Ah! Ba-da-bing ba-da-boom you just measure that thing with that thing and then you got the age of the Earth.   Kinda. I mean like look these are tricky equations tricky tools. It is not easy. So before you start measuring the meteorite you want to justhe just kind of wants to go practice on regular rocks like regular granite rocks just make sure that you know his technique is down.   Got it. Because you have to measure it so precisely.   It is gotta be so accurate. You really do not want to be making mistakes. So Pat takes a piece of granite and the machine spits out these results that are totally confusing.   Hmm.   Like his numbers are way off. There is way too much lead in the rock.     Like this rock would have been formed a gabillion years ago.   And he is just saying there is way too much lead there is way too much lead. And he could not figure out ...     But one day he is like let meyou know what? Let me just run a blank sample.   Something that chemists do when they want to just test their system is you just run it ...   Like instead of putting this piece of rock in here let me just run a blank.   And so when he did that he still got like a whole lot of lead.   So he is like Okay my blanks are not blanks.   So he knew that it was coming from the laboratory.   This is a contamination issue.   Right.     Okay.     So first he started with glass beakers he was using.   The vials are the first thing you are gonna look at. So he tests the vials. And he goes Shit.     These glass vials are made with lead so let us get some new vials.   Right.   So gets new glass vials. Special order never made with lead. Runs a sample again. It is still off.   Huh.   And so then he is like You know what? In the sample where I put the granite I also put some water in it. And he realizes actually the water is coming from lead pipes.   Ah.   And so he is like Oh crap. That is the problem. So he has to triple distill the water boil it off make sure he catches it in a vial that has no lead in it to make sure that his water does not have any contamination from the pipes it came through. So he runs the sample and it is a little better but there is still lead there. So now he is like obsessed. And Patterson he is working in this lab.   And it was pretty grubby.   He looks at the walls and he is like ...   There is peeling paint.   So he tests the paint.   It was in the paint.   So they repaint the walls. But still ...   There was way too much lead.   Then he looks at his desk where the mass spectrometer is sitting on and he figures out every joint in the desk is soldered together with lead.   Oh man.   So he needs a new desk new chairs with no lead. And then he uses Saran Wrap to cover every desk and every chair and every object in the room.   .   And still too much lead.   Wow!   And so he thinks maybe there is some lead in the dust on the floors. So he starts mopping the floors. He gets the lead numbers to come down a little bit. And then one day he notices a co-worker's lipstick is messing up his samples.   Hmm.   So he tests the makeup and he is like Okay there is lead in there too.   Wow.   We cannot wear makeup in this lab. And he eventuallyhe starts to get the lead number lower and lower. But then one day he is working in the lab and a little piece of his hair falls onto the desk and the lead numbers shoot up.   He said you know Holy shit!     It is on him.    Wow! He is the contamination himself!     And so he shaves his head.      But then one day he decides Okay well I am just gonna test my skin. And he ends up seeing that there is a bunch of lead in his skin.   Oh no!   It is everywhere.   There was lead in absolutely everything. And in the end he made peoplethey had a little anteroom and you had toyou literally had to strip down to your underwear and put on this Tyvek suit.   Which gets washed in acid.   And have little booties on and put plastic over their hair.   He builds positive pressure air vents so the air is constantly blowing and pushing anything inside the lab outside of the lab. So even if you walk in with a little microgram of lead the air may push it out.   Hmm.   He basically invents what we now call a clean lab.   Hmm.   But he ultimately gets his samples down his blank samples down to 0.1 micrograms. So that is one tenth of one millionth of a gram.   Oof!   And that took years.   But is that still too much?   No that is fine. And so after this he is finally actually ready to go to Canyon Diablo get this meteorite and actually measure the damn thing that he was trying to do from the beginning.   And so he took these precious samples ...   He puts the sample into the mass spec.   ... and it was late at night he was there by himself.   Just basically turns the crank and boom pops out a number.   Which was four-and-a-half billion years.   And that isis thatis that like way ...   That number is the age of the Earth.   Wow!   It is just a number but what it represents and it is this fundamental truth. And in this moment he is the only human being who knows the truth. He now has this window to that moment the formation of not just the Earth but the entire solar system. Sun the planets the moons the rings around Saturn me you everything comes from that.   I mean it was so exciting for him. He thought he was having a heart attack. He went to visit his parents in Iowa the next day and he made them take him to the hospital but he was fine. It was more like a lot of adrenaline coursing through him.   He calms himself down and hes like Here I go I got the number. He publishes it in a journal. And it is justyawns.      Like nobody cares.     So it definitely did not get into any textbooks it was not in the press. Seven years of his life has gone by.   So it was not ducks?   It was not.   What is a hard soup to make?   It was like foie gras or something I do not know.   Yeah okay. Thats good because it is also duck related I feel like.   Yeah yeah.   Okay.     Like this process of figuring out the age of the Earth sort of unveiled this truth about the world to him which is that we are totally contaminated with lead.   Right.   I am contaminated you are contaminated. Every living thing is just filled with lead. And now that he is seen that helike he cannot turn away from that vision. Like I almost think of it like The Matrix you know? When you go into the matrix and you see those little green numbers falling or whatever and you just see the world for what it is which is just like this thing that no one else is seeing you cannot look away.   But what happens when no one believes what you are seeing? Back in a minute.       Latif. Radiolab. Back with Avir who started with a story about uranium which has since now decayed into lead.   Yeah which I think is probably a boring topic. It is like talking about The Beatles you know what I mean? It is just like everyone kind of knows about The Beatles. And lead. You know you could talk to anybody everybody now knows like oh lead is bad for you. You know lead in paint chips like do not eat lead. But you know back in the '50s people really just did not care about this. They did notthey were not thinking about lead. And science of the day said sure lead poisoning is a thing. If you work in a mine and you you know do not wash your hands and then you eat a burger after touching lead ...   Right.   Then sure you will get lead poisoning. We have known that for thousands of years. But it is not like we are working in a lead mine you know?   Right.   But for our dude Pat he is like No no no. Come on. Like something is going on here. And he is like the only one who sees it.     That we are living in a dream. Like we are living in a lead mine.     Okay. So Pat's finding all this lead in his lab. He is stripping down to his underwear shaving his head. And he is telling people and they are just like Dude who cares? Like it is just your lab.   I definitely would have said that. I would have been like Okay. Yeah. So it is like an experimental nuisance like that -- I get that. You have proved that.   Right. But Patterson believes no this has to be bigger. Which leads him to this question which is okay there is a lot of lead in my lab but is there a lot of lead out in the world?   So ...   Lydia Denworth again.   He started by looking in the ocean.   So first thing he does is he gets a boat.           He has a big problem with sea sickness but he is just like whatever.     He goes out collects a bunch of water from the Pacific Ocean takes the water back analyzes it. And sure enough ...     There is a ton of lead in the ocean.     Proof!     And did it make waves in science or the public?     A lot of scientists were like ...     If you say so. I do not really know. I also do not really care you know? But he is more convinced than ever. I mean he starts walking around campus wearing a gas mask.   And a lot of people thought he was just plain crazy right?   Everyone's like dude lead is natural it is probably always been there. This is not some new crazy thing. But Pat just does not believe it. There is no way it is been like this forever. And then one day he gets into a conversation with a friend who gives him this idea.   That the place to look to understand the amount of lead in the air in the past ...   Is the permafrost of the snow in like Greenland or Antarctica.     And lead if it was in the air ...     It would come down out of the air and settle into the snow and it would never leave because that snow and ice did not melt.   And then the next year there is another snowfall. It does not melt. And then the year after that there is another snowfall that does not melt.     And the snow starts to like layer on top of each other almost like the rings of a tree. It justit is just preserved there.   Because it is permafrost. It is permanent frost. It is like it is permanently there. Right.   Yeah. Permafrost. So now it is 1964. He goes out to Greenland.   And he took his 15-year-old son with him.    Well I thought it was pretty cool.   This is Pat's son.   My name is the same as his. Clair Cameron Patterson III actually.   He goes by Cam.   Always have.   Basically you know they fly out to Greenland to this military base called Camp Century.   When you arrive there in a helicopter you do not see anything except antennas and a few trailers and oil barrels.   And snow. Snow that goes three miles deep. So Pat and Cam put on all this gear.   Dressed up in plastic suits.   Gloves.   And ...   Went down into this tunnel.   That went down into the ice.     And they cut out like four-by-four chunks of ice from the wall.   We had a melting trailer up on the surface.   So they melt down this ice ship it all the way back to the lab. And this is where Pat can really start to see the history of lead over time. And what he finds is that starting in like 1700 that there was basically no lead at all. Like nothing. And then in like 1750 with the start of the Industrial Revolution you see the lead levels start to go up and up and up and up.   Hmm.   Until 1930 the lead levels skyrocket straight upward. And Patterson's like ...     What the hell happened in 1930?   Well The thing that changed was ...     Suddenly ...   There was leaded gasoline in the air. So ...   Long story short ...   In 1921...   Car makers were trying to figure out how to get rid of something called engine knock.   Engine knock.   Knock. So like .   Which is the pinging and bucking that engines do and it slows down their efficiency.   And so there were chemists trying all sorts of different things. And eventually they put a teaspoon of lead into some gasoline.   And the engine knock stopped immediately.   Instantly gone. And people loved it. People wanted it. By 1960 90 percent of cars were using leaded gasoline. And Pat's sort of looking at his results from this permafrost and he is like ...   Holy smokes!   This cannot be good.   Yeah.   It is everywhere. And he wrote this paper that basically said that lead had contaminated everything in the Earth and that it is coming from leaded gasoline.   And this time when his paper goes out into the world ... no one cared.    Nope.   You know he sounded like a crackpot.   Cam says around this time at home his dad would sort of lose it.   Get all excited and ...     Talk about the idiots that did not understand anything.     Because there were a lot of people being like okay sure there is more lead in the air but that doesnt mean there is more lead in us. Next he basically gets a hold of 2000-year-old ancient Peruvian skeletons.   Mm-hmm.   And takes their teeth grinds up their teeth and measures the amount of lead in their teeth.   Okay.   Then he compares that to his own children's primary teeth.   Oh funny. It is like baby teeth. Yeah.   Their baby teeth yeah. He actually finds his children's teeth have 3000 times more lead than the Peruvians.   Oh God that is terrible.   And still people dont care.   Whoa!   Because they are like Okay there is more of it in us. Seems fine. It is not making you sick.   And when they say making you sick they meant you know killing you making you blind making you have seizures things like that right? Putting you in a coma.   I mean you know it is not uranium you know what I mean? It is not like people's hair and skin is just falling off and they are just vomiting blood you know?   Right.   So ...   It is more subtle than that.   Maybe more subtle. That is the question you know? Is this harmful?   Right.   And ...   And what is the harm?   And what is the harm right? But what I think is interesting is Pat doesnt try to answer that question.   Huh.           To be clear Pat was convinced that lead was harmful he just was not interested in doing the research that showed exactly how or to what extent or how to fix it.     And Patterson would share his data with them.     He would show them his techniques. And a lot of these people would go on to use this stuff to show just how harmful lead was.     And while he knew that this was a good thing to him it was like this slippery slope that led back into this messy world of human motivations and into policy and politics.   And the thing was Patterson was so difficult to work with that he often didnt get invited to be on the national committees that were deciding things.   And one of the few times he did he shows up in DC and they are talking about What should wewhat should we make recommendations to reduce the level of acceptable lead in the environment to? And he just says it should be zero. That is the acceptable level. And so theythey do this without him. He refuses to sign the final report and he writes at the bottom Dr. Patterson does not wish to be associated with this report. He writes his own addendum. He just writes this line The mining and smelting of lead within the human environment is actually a monumental crime committed by humanity against itself. Period.     Regardless the EPA did slowly start catching up to the science and banning lead from things.     But to Pat that was not the purpose of science not like real science. For him science was how it was when he was a kid you know? Where science is not about solving some problem.     And now that Pat had been able to prove what the natural level of lead should be he was really just left with this simple question     He started looking at ice cores that went all the way back to 800 BC and what he found was this was not the first time that this had even happened you know? Like Greeks Romans every empire has poisoned themselves with lead.     And at this point Patterson's question starts to shift. It becomes just a question of why are we this way?     He actually starts writing a book and it is ...     ... all over the place. It is about ...     ... neural pathways ...     ... it is about ...     ... problem-solving ...     ... human civilization the nature of scientific thought.   He worked on this idea for years and never really seemed to get anywhere. And it was tough on him.   Cam said over time he noticed his dad grew angrier more jaded and talked less spent less time with his kids. And on December 5 1995 he has an asthma attack in his office and he dies. He was 73.   Less than a month after his death January 1 1996 the EPA banned the greatest source of all lead on Earth the one that had driven Pat crazyleaded gasoline. And obviously lead is still with us today. Like that is very clear. But in the years since Patterson's death the amount of lead on the average freeway has decreased by 97 percent. And the average lead in people's blood in America has decreased by 94 percent. And lead experts say that all of that resulted in a five point increase in preschoolers' IQ. And just as a side note the age of the Earth still stands at 4.5 billion years old which is exactly as Patterson had calculated 70 years ago.   But what really struck me when reporting this story is like how little recognition Clair Patterson got over the course of his life. But eventually some of his students banded together to nominate him for the Tyler Prize which is an environmental award. It is kind of a big deal. And he actually won the award eight months before his death. But by all accounts including his own he took no pride in it.                 Reporter Avir Mitra.
