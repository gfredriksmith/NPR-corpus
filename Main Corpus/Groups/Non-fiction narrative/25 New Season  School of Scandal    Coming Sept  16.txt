 I am Gregory Warner host of NPR's ROUGH TRANSLATION. As we enter this uncertain election season one thing we know for sure - things are going to get dirty. And I am not just talking about the U.S. campaign trail.  I raised both my middle fingers and shot  rapid slurs at the justice system.  Starting September 16 we bring you a new series - ROUGH TRANSLATION's School of Scandal.  There are lines that should not be crossed. Do not cross them.  We will take you around the world to meet people calling each other out...  All of these comments are scrolling across the screen.  ...And taking each other down...  We are just going to take out all our anger on censorship in general on you.  ...To try to change the status quo...  It is a good feeling in a bad moment. Some of us have to now really come to terms with how do we then go from here?  ...Because sometimes a little scandal can help you see what is really important. We are going to meet fan fiction writers fighting Internet censors in China...  Where it is like negative influence or pornographic suggestions.  ...Indians calling out caste privilege in Silicon Valley.  Many feel a little bit uncomfortable but they say thank you for saying the way it is. I am like there is no other way I could have said it .  And in Uganda a poet with nothing to lose battles a dictator by baring it all.  Everybody had ignored me. I tried so hard and nobody cared.  ROUGH TRANSLATION's School of Scandal - that starts September 16.  But that day they got it.  Listen and subscribe.  You do not need a bullet or a bomb. You just need your boobs.  Why? Why does that work?  Scandal like .
