       Gonads episode three. I am Molly Webster.   Hello?   Hello are you still there?   I am still here.   And this is my mother Mary Webster.   Yes.   But -- but yeah the bedbugs are such a freaking pain.   Oh it sounds awful.   You have to vacuum all of the baseboards you have to vacuum the floors. You have to vacuum the doorjambs because they crawl up the walls when they are trying to get away.   Oh Molly that sounds awful!   So I recently called my mom for -- I guess to catch up but also ...     I had a work question.      That is been bugging me.     Was on my mind.   Yeah.   So I asked her Mom I have been working on this story. And it made me wonder what you would have named me if I was a boy.   You would have been named Daniel.   Hmm.   Dad always liked the name. And if we ever had a boy Dad said he was gonna name him Daniel. And I said Oh! If that is what you want go for it you know? Because he did not want a Junior he wanted a Daniel. He wanted a little Danny.   Instead he got a Judy Chrissy Peggy and Molly.   Your poor father.   The -- my lucky father!   If you had come out boys you would have been Daniel yes.   Wait. All of us?   No. Well you see -- no we wanted Daniel for a boy. Not for everybody.   You were just ready.   Yeah well we did not know. When a boy came out it was gonna be a Daniel you know what I mean? That was it.   So this is just gonna sound ridiculous but I called my mom because all these stories that we have been doing in this series they do make you think about fate. Like even if you think about the first one where they are the primordial germ cells and they are holding on to all sorts of possibilities and futures and then ...     Chromosomes step in and -- poof -- no more infinity. You are just like shunted onto a path. I guess -- I guess asking my mom about Daniel was just like a clumsy way of getting back to what feels like a really pristine moment. Like a moment where no decision had been made. Where you exist totally unblemished by life and choice and fate. Unless maybe life is not so fateful.      Case in point David Zarkower.   Hello.   Hi.   Actually I am just going to -- I do not like correcting people but I will just correct you. My name is pronounced Zarkover.   Zarkover?   Zarkover yep.   Because it is a 'w' right? I am not misspelling it in my head.   It is a 'w' yeah. Just you know for the sake of my parents I pronounce it with like a 'v.' It is essentially Polish.   That is good. And you work at the University of Minnesota?   Yep. That is right.   What do you do there?   Genetic cell biology and development.   That is -- that seems scary.   It is broad.   Anyways the reason I called Zarkower was because I came across a series of experiments that he did that just straight up kicked me in the gonads.   Okay so ...   To begin ...   This was back in the early 1990s.   Zarkower was working in a lab doing genetic stuff.   In worms and flies and mice and things. And ...   One day ...   Presto. We got lucky.   Da da da da!   He and his team discovered a brand new gene.   Yep. That is right.   They saw it in mice and gave it a name.   I unfortunately I am responsible for this. It is DMRT1.   DMRT1.   DMRT1 yep.   Demert-one.   I keep trying to say DRMT ...   Yeah it is -- it is a nightmare. I am very sorry for that.   And what was interesting was that this gene was in mice ...   But also in humans.   And in the male mouse it was expressing itself in the testes. I never know how to say it. Testis?   Testes? Testes.   Testes? Testicles?   Testis.   Is that a single?   Yeah.   Hmm.   Okay.   So yeah. So we found this gene and humans had it in the testis. And the question we had was whether it was doing something or not.   Like you have got genes in your eyes that are making chemicals that are making your eyes the color they are.   This gene DMRT1 ...   What is it doing?   We wanted to know if it is involved in maybe making sperm.   Or ...   Maybe it just hangs around it does not matter.   It does not do anything.   You know we do not know.   And so they are like Let us mess around with it and see what happens. But you cannot do that experiment in humans.   No.   So instead they get some adult male mice.   Perfectly normal fertile males.   That are making sperm.   And we use some fancy molecular genetic tricks.   And so basically ...   It is kind of mean trick but it is genetics.   They cut the gene out and then they take a slice of the testis and they look at it under the microscope.   And it did not look like what we would have expected.   And what they expect to see is that these are the cells that help make sperm in the testis and normally they are kind of tall and lean.   Long and skinny.   But suddenly ...   They were different.   With DMRT-1 gone they had gotten smaller and rounder. And Zarkower was like ...   This was not something that was supposed to happen.   What is going on here?   What are these things?   And then he realized that the cells are making estrogen and he was like Oh I think what is happening is that the cells in the testis turned into ovary cells.   Wait what?   And ...   Wait. This is a male mouse.   Yes.   So you are saying this male mouse now has ovary cells in its testicles?   Yes this -- these are cells that are changing their sex.   That is insane! Can we just have like an exclamatory moment? Like where you -- where you like Whoa is that -- that is possible that happened? What is -- you know?   What do you say? For us anyway the greatest of all scientific exclamations is That is weird! So we had a That is weird moment.   And just to take this weirdness like one step further a group of scientists did a similar experiment in adult female mice where they did like the same ...   Fancy molecular genetic tricks.   Only this time they knocked out a female gene in the ovary. And when they went to look at it ...   The ovary is trying to kind of reorganize itself into a testis.   Wait.   Mm-hmm?   You are saying in both cases there is one gene that is flipping the sex from male to female or back?   Yes.   One gene.   One gene.   How many genes do we have in our body?   I do not know. Like tens of thousands?   Whoa. And just one is doing this.   Which is ...   Weird.   A weird concept to think of because we typically connect like sex or gonads to chromosomes. At least I do. Like an X and a Y.   Right.   Is a girl and a boy. So how could a gene step in and reverse that?   Yeah because I thought chromosomes were lots of genes. They were these like massive things. One gene is so tiny.   Genes are tiny chromosomes are much bigger. And I think the answer to that is that when you get down to sex like what makes us one sex or the other it is not -- it does not work exactly like we thought. Like take for example the X and Y idea. This like chromosomal narrative we have of biological sex it is a specific way of thinking about things from a certain moment in history that we are potentially starting to rethink.   Huh.   I think it is helpful to see sort of like the history of how we understand sex in -- in a longer time-frame. So let me bring in this guy.   I am David Page biology professor at MIT.   Okay where do we start?   Oh my gosh. Well we are gonna go -- so let us see we could go off the rails in any number of directions here all of which would be quite -- quite productive. But let us see. So let us go back to the 1890s.   Yeah that definitely is 1890s.   So ...   So genetics was in its infancy. Mendel peas all that was happening.   And people had been pondering for millennia where do boys and girls come from?   Now when it came to how you look people thought Mom and Dad? Clearly involved.   Because people had realized you know that children ended up growing up looking something like their mother and their father.   Like maybe you have a chin like your dad and nose like your mom and hair that is a little bit of both.   There was a kind of blending ...   Of mom and dad to make you you.   Right. But ...   When it came to why you were the sex you were?   Hmm.   That was a mystery.   Because ...   There was no blending.   You ended up being like either your mother or your father.   One or the other.   Therefore it must not have anything to do with heredity. It had to be imposed from the outside in some way.   So people came up with all kinds of ideas for what made you a boy or a girl.   The phase of the moon at the moment of conception.   Cold dark moon? Definitely a girl.   The state of the economy.   Would not be surprised down economy? Girl.   Yeah.   Everything that was bad was given to women. There was what the mother ate mom's body heat stress.   All sorts of crazy things. And then in 1923 ...   We started looking elsewhere ...     ... for an answer.     Chromosomes.   Chromosomes.     In 1923 a scientist looking down the barrel of a microscope discovers two new chromosomes.   An X and a Y.     But I just want to hit pause here.   Okay.   I came to find out actually from David Page that the X and Y chromosomes do not look like an X and Y.   Wait. They do not look like the letters?   Oh no no no.   No when they first discovered them.   They were blobs.   Under the microscope they just looked like these misshapen clumps.   I would say kidney bean-like.   The X looked bigger the Y looked smaller but that is it.   That is so interesting because there is something about the shape of the X and the shape of the Y which read as gendered letters.   That feels so -- yeah.   Yeah because like the Y has a little stem on it which is sort of penis-like.   Penis-like. There is like a duality or something in the X which feels like you know ovaries and breasts or something. Like there is like -- there is something about those letters. So I was totally shocked when he was like There is no real reason they got those letters. It was totally arbitrary. Anyways when they found these chromosomes ...   It was clear that if you had ...     Two X chromosomes you would develop as a female.     Anatomic female. And if you had a y chromosome ...   So your X Y.   You would develop as an anatomic male.     That was the thinking.     But then that idea it got more complicated.   Yeah.   Yeah when did you intersect with this story?   The summer of 1979.   Page was at MIT.   First year of medical school. And the DNA revolution ...     ... was just beginning.     He was involved in what he describes as like the precursor ...   To ...     What would become the Human Genome Project. Working with a group of senior scientists who were envisioning maps of the human genome.     And we began to look back at some exceptional human individuals who had not been understood previously.     Women ...     ... who had an X and Y chromosome.     And they were also looking at men ...   Who had an altogether male anatomy.   Penis testes.   But whose chromosomes appeared to be those typical of a female.   XX. And for Page and other scientists they are like Oh there must be something more happening here than just like the chromosome. There must be something deeper going on here.   So we might actually be on the trail now of the secret.   So scientists across the world start looking at these people's chromosomes.   And what we found was that a few XY females were actually missing a little bit of the Y chromosome.   With these XY women a little bit of the Y was not there.   And the bit of the Y that the XY females were missing was the same bit that was present in the XX males.   Meaning somehow a little bit of the Y chromosome had gotten onto one of the Xs of these XX males.   And so it was becoming very clear that this must be the bit that matters.   And around 1990 ...     Scientists in Britain announced they would found this one gene on the Y chromosome.     What they found is that of the 200-odd genes on the Y chromosome there was this one single gene that acted as the switch.     The grandmaster switch.     So it is not X and Y as a whole it is one tiny piece. So back in the first episode there were those primordial germ cells. And they had to go on that super long journey to get to the gonad cathedral. And on the journey when they got to the cathedral they were full of potential right? They could be anything. They could be male they could be female they could be whatever your version of anything is. And then when they get there there is a moment where like we said fate stepped in and just -- whoosh! -- like swept all their possibility away and said You are one thing and this is the thing you will be This gene is fate. This gene these scientists discovered if it shows up then you shoot off down the path that is sperm testis male. And if it does not show up you shoot down the path of egg ovary female. And the scientists gave this gene a name SRY.   Uh-huh.   Which is like Sorry. It was like You are a man. Sorry!   So it sounds like we have gone from like crazy ideas about what makes a boy or a girl to chromosomes to now like this little gene.   Yeah.   But the SRY gene that you just mentioned is different than the gene that I just heard about from -- I forget his name.   Zarkower.   Zarkower.   Zarkower yeah.   Zarkower.   Zarkower yes.   It is. I think ...   It is different? Is that the same gene? Or is it ...   DMRT-1 is a different gene than SRY. But this -- this is what is so crazy about DMRT-1. Okay primordial germ cells they are in the embryo. They are waiting to become something and then SRY shows up.   But just comes on for about a day and then it goes away.   But once it turns on it then starts this like cascade of gene after gene after gene that all sort of say You are male you are male you are male. And what all of these genes do is they create chemicals that send out signals that start forming and shaping the testis.   And as soon as the testis begins to develop.   On turns the fourth gene.   DMRT-1.   Zarkower's gene.   And it clearly is important for finishing the job of making a testis.   But the thing is most of these other genes that make the testis turn off but DMRT-1 ...   It does not go away at that point. It stays active.   Forever. In the womb when the testis is just growing and then when you are born. And through you know childhood your teenage years adulthood. Like until you die DMRT-1 is on. And if you take it away like Zarkower did the cell will actually change sex. Which leads you to believe that DMRT-1 is actually preventing a cell from switching sexes.   That is right.   So I called Blanche Capel who is the geneticist from our first episode. And she explained that what all this means is that that other path the path that you did not take in the gonad cathedral it never went away. It is actually still there. You carry it with you always. It is just that that gene has been shushing it.   Yeah.   Wait. I am repressing the other pathway my whole life? Like ...   I think -- we think so. Yeah.   Really?   Yeah.   There is like a parallel universe male Molly?    Yes I -- I think there is. There is a parallel universe male Molly.   Wow! That is just cool!   Wait. When you say this gene has been shushing the other Molly what does that even mean?   Huh. Okay so you can think of it like this the code for that other Molly who I will call Daniel that code is still in my cells. And Zarkower says that what this gene does is it sort of -- one of the things this gene does is it sort of patrols and it makes sure that Daniel genes do not turn on.   Basically what this gene's been doing it turns out is playing whack-a-mole.   Basically just going around and being like Daniel no. Off. Daniel no. Off. Pew pew pew. And it does this maybe every day.   It is like an election that is always being kind of challenged. SRY cast the deciding vote and male happened. But there is a recount every now and then. And if DMRT-1's not there to say Nope still male then you can go the other way.   So now I understand why you are so obsessed with Daniel because -- because it is not just an idea he is like trying to get out.   And it does go both ways. Like you know there is SRY and there is DMRT-1 but they have found these key genes in ovaries that you can turn on and off and have similar results.   Why would our -- why would our bodies be set up this way? Like you would think once a decision gets made that you just make that decision and be done with it. Why would there always be the possibility of unmaking the decision?   That is a good question and I will answer that after break. But first I am gonna call my sisters.          All right back to Gonads. I am Molly Webster.   Everyone say their name or hello.   Okay it is Chrissy.   Dude!   Peggy?   Yeah.   Hi. Hi how are you?   I am great.   And these are my sisters Judy Chrissy and Peggy.   Okay so I will tell -- so I am gonna tell you guys the thing. It is not even that big of a deal but it is just sort of funny.   Oh my God!   Oh no. Okay.   You are pregnant.   I am not pregnant. I am not -- no no. I just want to tell you about some reporting that I have been doing and then a funny thing that Mom and Dad told me. That is all it is.   Okay.   Mom had an affair.   No! Oh God. That would be ...   One of us does not belong. It is Chrissy.   Yeah.   This is ridiculous. The third episode is basically about how we all carry in us like the opposite self that we never became. So -- so I called Mom because I was like What would male Molly have been like? Like did you guys have like a name for male Molly?   Mm-hmm.   And they were like Oh we would have called you Daniel.   No! That was what they were supposed to call me. They were so desperate to use Daniel.   And it turns out that we were all supposed to be called Daniel.   That is the big reveal?   It is not a reveal!   There is an inner Daniel Webster.   Yes!   Jesus Molly!   Oh man! Are you surprised that your name would have been Daniel Webster? That you would have been a Daniel?   No.   No?   No! I think you all knew that right?   Peggy did you know that?   I -- I did not know that.   I do not feel like my inner Daniel Webster would have that much of a different life than I have. So but I think you guys honestly -- not to railroad this conversation but I think you guys lucked out because I was the one that was raised with the hopes that there was like some Daniel lingering in me.   Is not Daniel Webster like a famous dude in history?   Yes.   Oh.   I took a picture of a statue of him once and send it to Dad because I was supposed to be Daniel.   Who is Daniel Webster?   He is a boring white dude.   Well of course he is. We knew that part.   He served as senator from Massachusetts and was the Undersecretary of State under three presidents.   Well someone Googled fast.   I think he is just a regular like old white lawyer dude.   Yeah they are all racist. Or sexist or ageist or just a douchebag.    All right. Well ...   Great. Peggy got her giggles in. It is all been worth it. All right. That is all I got.   We love you Molly.   I love you guys. Goodbye.   Love you!   Bye.   Bye Molly. You are amazing.   Okay bye.   I am sorry about your bedbugs. Bye.      Okay so to catch everybody up we have learned that we are all carrying around with us another path. We all have our own inner Daniel Websters and we are constantly shushing it. Or them. Whatever. So my question for Zarkower was like why would I carry this path with me if I am always turned -- like if I am just turning it off?   Um.   Do you have any answer to that?   I wish I had the answer. So the -- we do not really have an answer. It could be as boring as well it does not really matter because normally no molecular geneticist comes in and hacks out DMRT-1 or turns on FixL-2 or whatever. So why solve a problem that you have not created? That -- that is quite possible but boring. The more interesting answer is that this is an evolutionary holdover from a common ancestor with fish.   Okay so this ancestor would be our great-grandparent 16 million times removed which means 400 million years ago a fish swam out of the depths of the ocean crawled onto land and took like squelching steps forward and forward and forward and forward and forward through millions of years of luck and chance and fate until finally getting to you and me and ...   Ooh hello?   Hello.   Can you hear me?   Yes can you hear me?   Yes I sure can.   Bob.   My name is Bob Warner. I am a research professor.   Studies evolution and marine biology.   At UC Santa Barbara.   What is your attraction to the ocean?   Well the whole idea that there is a different world under there.   Well I am just going to Attenborough the shit out of this. So down in the waters around the Florida Keys there swims a remarkable fish.   The bluehead wrasse.   It is a very common coral reef fish.   This is Marshall Phillips.   Graduate student at North Carolina State University.   She like Bob studies blueheads.   Yes!   Anyways down in the keys are some ...   Primo spots.   Nice patches of reef.   That might have a group of say a dozen ...   Blueheads.   And in that group there will be a single large brightly-colored male.   Just one of them.   Yeah.   About the size of your hand.   With a blue head.   And a shiny blue-green body.   It has white and black stripes right behind its head.   That go black-white-black.   That we very technically call the Oreo.   And if he is got a big Oreo?   Well that is a sexy male .   And then the rest of the group is essentially a harem of lady-fish.   And the ladies in the group ...   Are little and yellow.   Very pretty.   That kind of swim a little slower watching out for things.   Where the male is ...   Flashy. Darting all around.   Much more aggressive.   And so this one male and this harem of females will basically spend their entire lives on this one patch of reef.   Where they mate every day.   Each female with that one male.   All that entails is the male and the female will dart up in the water column together ...   And then at the same time he will release his sperm and she will release her eggs.   And then they dart right back down.   And then a different female same male go up. Egg-sperm.   And dart back down.   And then again different female same male. They go up.   Down.   And this is what they do every day.   Over and over.   Kind of sounds like a cult of the 1960s.    But say something happens to this male.   Well say a predator comes along and he chomps that male.   So the alpha male ...   Is eaten up.   Dead.   Yep.   Gone. Now the question is what happens to the ladies? You would think it would be chaos because their whole system's been thrown out of whack.   But within minutes to hours ...   Life finds a way. Somehow the ladies pick who will be the next male.   The ladies have it pretty well worked out who is the largest.   Do they all start like eyeballing each other like ...?   They do not line up or anything.   Okay.   Hmm. Am I bigger than you? No. Like but somehow they figure it out.   And so once they establish who the largest female is she starts to change her behavior. She gets a little more friendly ...   Towards the other females.   She will swim up to them.   Do this little wiggly dance.   Sort of waving her pectoral fin at the ladies.   Which is not really something they do as a female ever.   And then ...   As time goes on ...   Her body starts to change.   She will get a little bit bigger.   How do you just suddenly get bigger?   Testosterone.   Her brain starts sending signals to produce tons of testosterone.   Testosterone is taking over.   And as she starts to grow ...   A little bit of blue starts to appear right at her nose.   Her scales start to change color.   And sort of spread backwards right at her chin and spread outwards.   Until her head is entirely blue. And then these dark stripes start to form.   Those will eventually become that black-white-black Oreo.   And the other thing that starts to happen is her ovaries start to disintegrate.   These are the most valuable cells in the body and now suddenly they are being destroyed.   And then they start to rebuild themselves into testes that start producing ...   Sperm. Really rapidly.   Wow!   It is nuts. It is absolutely incredible. And then sex cult is back.   There is a new dominant male at the top of the heap.   But ...   At first he is not very good at being a male.    Like he does not quite know when to dart up and when to spawn.   It is just like a teenager who does not know how to talk to girls.   But eventually he gets the hang of it.   And can produce baby blueheads.   And the cycle of life continues!    That is a good Attenborough.   Thank you.   That is crazy that they just disintegrate their insides and then rebuild.   But the funny thing is if you ask Bob about this stuff ...   No in fact ...   About how these little lady fish completely transform he is like Meh.   Yeah I hate to admit that but yeah.   It is not that shocking.   The shocking thing is how many fishes change sex.   It turns out it is a lot of fishes.   Nearly all the wrasses.   Your blueheads your fairies your flashers.   Parrotfishes.   They actually look like parrots.   They change sex. Most of the big groupers.   The tiny gobies.   Damselfishes. Everyone asks about clownfish.   Finding Nemo.   Yes they change sex.   But they do it a little differently.   They go from male to female.   Up with the clownfish matriarchy. Bob says we are dealing with like ...   Hundreds.   A whole lot of sex-changing fish.   Easily.   Wow hundreds!   Yep.   But here's a really crazy thing. It is not just fishes.   Some shrimps worms ...   Alligators.   If you include all of the animals in which their sex goes a different way than you would think ...   Flies lobsters.   Bananas.   Lizards birds.   Mussels snails slugs.   Chickens.   Chickens?   Oh eels.   Frogs. It is just amazing. And wait 'til we get to turtles.   It is a whole zoo in this conversation.   I know.   So why would fish -- like why would -- or why would any animal did change sex?   Well I think sex change increases your fitness. You have more young either eggs that you produce or eggs that you fertilized than you would as a -- as a single sex.   In other words it just ensures that you can pass on your genetic material. Like if you are the fishes on the reef and the male disappears you are stuck and there is no -- your DNA goes nowhere. But if you can become a male ...   Hmm.   You can make sure that your DNA goes somewhere and then like all the other fishes in your little kingdom go somewhere.   Okay so now let me ask you the next obvious question. You have told me that we come from the fish.   Yes.   They have got this flexy-sexy thing and that we have it to some degree.   Mm-hmm.   Daniel lurks within you and is being actively suppress every single day. So can we be like the fish?   Yeah it does make you think of that. Zarkower says that ever since he did those mouse experiments he gets this question a lot.   Yeah yeah. There is some interest from the transgender community and whether this could be something that would be helpful. But we cannot do it. We technically cannot ...   Zarkower says it is unethical and at this point probably even technically impossible to take that gene away. And even if we could removing a gene just will not physically reorganize us in the way the fish do. He says at most ...   You might be able to produce your own natural sex hormones of the type that is more aligned with your gender identity.   Oh pretty crazy you could even get the body to do that. But the reason we cannot actually do the full-on switch is because humans -- male and female humans -- have developed internal reproductive plumbing that is so different from each other it would be impossible at the drop of a hat to switch.   Well so then -- then this makes me confused.   Well ...   Is this to use Blanche is word from a few episodes ago is this bi-potentiality that is still is there?   Yeah.   Latent. Being suppressed. Is that a legacy thing that is just fading away? Or is there -- is it there for a reason? It is there for a reason in the fish. Is it there for a reason in us?   Does it serve a purpose?   And therefore will be there with us ...   Always.   Always.   Or maybe even get stronger?   Yeah it is ...   No I asked Blanche that.   I do not know. I do not know. I do not have a good answer for that. But it ...   Do you think anyone does? Or is this like a ...   No I do not think anyone does. I think we are all trying to figure out why it would be the case. And most people ask the same question you asked why would this be true? And I do not know why it would be true.   Even if we do not know why just knowing that that other path is there just below the surface you know almost like wanting to express itself does make you think a different way about how rigidly we define ourselves.   I think we like to bend people as male or female and we have always put people in two piles. But I think there is a tremendous amount of middle ground. Even when you are just talking about you know things like the level of testosterone you are making or the level of estrogen you are making or the shape of your genitalia or many other features that we bend as male or female. I think there is a lot of -- there is a lot of variation between the two piles. And maybe we just have not appreciated the variation that exists naturally in our population.
