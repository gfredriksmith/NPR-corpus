     Before we get started just a note. This episode contains some strong language as well as content that may not be suitable or at least ready for younger ears. It is an episode about Sex Ed. Okay thanks.     Hey I am Molly Webster. This is Gonads episode six and it is our last episode . I am gonna go cry after this is done but first I want to share with you this really fun thing that Team Gonads did in May. And that is we did a live event on Sex Ed. You know if you have been listening to this series we have been looking at the biology of biological sex and sex determination. And one of the things we kept thinking was like man now that we know how complicated it is like how do we teach this stuff? And how do we teach this stuff in a climate where people are really polarized and divided? And thinking about all this Sex Ed it just felt like more than a radio story. You know if you bring up Sex Ed with anybody they have stories they get excited they get animated and it really felt like something that would live quite beautifully in a live space in a live event. You know almost like recreate the Sex Ed classes we all may or may not have gone through. So today we will be bringing you clips of that show and it starts with Jad Abumrad.   Hello hello! How are you guys doing?     All right! So so so excited you are here. So I guess I should just say welcome to Radiolab Sex Ed!     That is a sentence I never thought I would say. In the 15 years I have been doing this show I never anticipated this moment where I would be on-stage saying that to a live group of humans. But you know here we are. And I grew up in Tennessee so I actually did not have Sex Ed. So I am looking forward to learning something tonight. Please welcome to the stage Radiolab's Molly Webster!     Hello? Hello hello hello. Whoo! This kind of feels like my Sex Ed class which was like nerve-wracking and you are not sure how it is gonna go . So to start the night we are gonna go down South. Mississippi 2011. The state passes a law that places some restrictions on Sex Ed notably when it comes to talking about condoms.   The law specifically says no instruction or demonstration on the application of a condom.   So that is Sanford Johnson. He is a sex educator in Mississippi. And so on the one hand you might think no big deal right? It is just a piece of plastic. Kids can figure out how to use it. We do not have to show them everything. But Sanford says it is not really that easy.   I will tell you a story from when I was a high school teacher here in the Mississippi Delta because ...   The school brought in a guest certified sex educator to talk to the kids about sex.   He said this quote that has -- it has stuck with me for 15 years now. But he said when you make a condom in the time it takes you to drive it from the factory to the store it loses half of its effectiveness. And then he said that in the time it takes you to drive it from the store to your house it loses another half of its effectiveness. And in the time it takes you to take it out of the wrapper and actually put it on it loses another half of its effectiveness. And I was thinking that is not how math works!   So Sanford and all of his teacher friends were like well if this is what kids are being told maybe we really do need to do those condom demonstrations. But the question is how. So for Sanford this all came to a head at a teacher training that he was at. So the teacher training was to train teachers in how to teach Sex Ed and as part of the training one of the teachers was like up in front of the group and she was supposed to explain how to use a condom. Because this is the caveat in the law. You can talk about a condom but you cannot explain or like show how to use one. And so this teacher ...   She was a hand-talker. So as she talks she pantomimed a lot and as she was reading the steps like she could not help but actually pantomime how to put on a condom. And somebody from the state department said I do not think you should do that. I really do not think you should do that. Like that is a condom demonstration.   Talking with her hands was now illegal.   And it got to the point where as she is saying the steps she actually has her hands behind her back and like that is how she is giving -- like that is how she is going through the steps. So we thought it was the most hilarious thing in the world.   It is hilarious yes. But it is also like we need to tell these kids about condoms and we do not really know how to do it. And so thinking about this the next day Sanford came up with something that I think might be one of my most favorite things on the internet.     It is kind of this like grainy in the shadows iPhone video in which Sanford Johnson is standing there with one foot barefoot while he is holding a white tube sock and a sneaker. And remember according to Mississippi law he is not allowed to perform an actual condom demonstration with a condom. So what he does is he holds up this tube sock to the camera and he says ...     This video lives on our website and you should absolutely go watch it when you are done with this episode. This video is delightful but it served a larger purpose for us which is that it reminded us that there are a lot of different ways to have conversations about sex and the body. And we thought okay what if for our live show we try to reframe the conversations happening around Sex Ed? What if we use metaphor and euphemism and comedy maybe even a little meditation as a way to navigate all the stuff swirling around Sex Ed whether that is a law in Mississippi or just the general awkwardness that comes with this topic. So to do this one thing Sanford and sex educators from all across the country told us was that a key part of a Sex Ed classroom was a question box where students could drop in anonymous questions and then the teachers would pull them out and answer them to try and facilitate discussion. So we thought what if we make our own question box and try and answer the questions with this reframing? So we gathered questions from listeners Reddit Sanford fifth graders. It is in no way comprehensive but we gave it a try. To kick us off here's Majel Connery singing the first question. This is just her a mic and a vocoder.   What are periods? What are periods? Oh what are periods? Oh what oh what are periods?   It is really an unbelievable pain. It feels like someone's shoving a knife up inside me and then turning it slowly but with no rhythm that I can track so I can never quite get my head on top of it of predicting it. It feels like I am like in hell and I cannot move.   That is Sindha Agha. She is 24 a filmmaker. And she is talking about what she goes through every month when she gets her period. Now periods sort of a weird topic still a little taboo hush hush. I say paternalism maybe. Like it is a little hard though roughly half the planet does not get them. And even if you do every period is so different they are kind of hard to talk about. But Sindha has seemingly found a new language for discussing her period and it is with kind of an unexpected companion. Some background ...   So I have endometriosis which is a reproductive illness that one in 10 American women have where your endometrium which is usually the lining of your uterus that gets shed during your period starts growing in all these places it is not supposed to. So on your organs and your intestines.   Wait it actually starts growing outside of your uterus?   That is what endometriosis is.   So each month -- and I had no idea about this I feel embarrassed as a 35-year-old woman to have gotten to this point and not known this but each month your body tries to push out all that extra tissue that is in places and it cannot.   It cannot get rid of it.   And so it is very painful. And you can take birth control to help eliminate the pain which Sindha did for many years but then she started getting depressions and all these complications and so she had to stop. And as soon as she did the pain came rushing back.   I got my first period off of birth control. I was maybe 22 years old. And it hit me when I was at the airport in Casablanca in Morocco alone because I was traveling back from Liberia.   She would been making a documentary for the BBC and was about to fly home.   And I got my period and I had like 30 minutes 'til I was supposed to board my flight to JFK to get back to the United States. And all of a sudden I could not move.   She said she just sort of froze in place in front of the food court.   And a janitor ended up coming up to me and being like Are you okay? in Arabic. And I was like I kind of speak French I do not speak Arabic. And he was like Are you okay? in French and I respond and I was like oh I do not know how to say 'period' in French.   He was very helpful but the pain was so bad she was just like I have to call somebody.   And I still had wi-fi so I called my dad.   Which I was kind of surprised about. Like I am pretty close to my dad but he is not the period guy. Maybe we are old-fashioned I do not know. So we called them both into the studio to talk about it.   All right.   Okay so I am Gul Agha. I am a professor and I am her dad.   I asked him what was it like to get that phone call.   You know it was hard for me because I could not do anything. It was sort of helpless and all you can do is sit there and feel the emotions but not be able to you know ...   I feel really bad for you yeah.   Gul said that on that call while Sindha was in the Casablanca airport and he was all the way in Illinois he just started trying to do everything.   Close your eyes take a deep breath. What are you feeling?   Meanwhile Sindha's literally ...   I sound like I am having a baby. In labor.   Yeah it is like being in the labor room.   She was crying and moaning and Gul's trying to make her feel better. He is like tossing out all these ideas but the pain's still really bad.   And then my dad said Think about a color. Like think about the color red. And then shift it to a different color in your brain.   In that moment Sindha became 11 years old again. It was her first period and the pain was terrible.   I was laying in bed. My mom could not be there. And she was you know almost always there but she had to be at work and I was having really bad cramps. So it was my dad and my uncle leaning over me trying to help me and I was just like mortified but I was in too much pain to like really worry about it. And my dad turned on Gregorian chants and he burned some incense and he started waving it over my head and he was saying like Just track the smoke with your eyes and just follow it. Follow it. Okay. Imagine you are the smoke and you are just floating. And I was really committing to this. I was like Okay I am the smoke! And then he was like Okay close your eyes. Imagine a color. What color you seeing? I was like Red. Obviously because I was on my period.   Sindha realized in that moment she could actually see the pain. It was a thing that had a shape to it that she could identify.   And then he is like Okay and now try to change it into a different color with your brain. And I was like I guess blue.   Sindha found herself thinking back to that moment and once again talking to her dad and trying to transform the color of the pain.   I remember standing on the little staircase that leads up to the plane and I was like gripping onto the bar trying not to fall over and like gritting my teeth just like clenching my jaw. And I was just like Okay the color red. Okay I see it. Yeah I see it. All right. Okay come on. Turn into something else. Pink maybe. Okay. All right whew!   And she says standing there about to board the seven-hour flight it actually helped.   I mean I was still in really bad pain but mentally I can -- I can stay here.   Sit inside of it.   It is like it is to be non-judgmental.   Yeah.   It is like okay I am feeling pain let us really feel it.   It is very Sufi because in his -- in Sufi tradition and Sindhi culture ...   And so Sindha and her dad are from Southern Pakistan.   You do not like try to avoid suffering. Instead you just try to express it. Like when someone dies there is literally professional wailers that you hire to come wail and cry with you right? Or maybe you do not pay them but you were telling me about this.   Yeah that it is common. Yeah. Yeah and you know and every time somebody comes visiting the whole story is repeated and then the professional wailers start to ...   Crying. It is their job to like express suffering.   And it is to get you to cry again.   It is not to be the crier if you cannot cry? It is actually to get you keep going through it.   Yes.   To keep crying to keep pushing through the feeling.   Right.   So sit with the pain that is point number one. And point number two is pain to me seems pretty dark. I do not know about you but I do not know if I would actually think about a color. But Sindha said for her family it is not that surprising because her dad's like a little obsessed with color.   You know he would always wear like Post-It note hot pink bright orange purple.   You are wearing purple right now. Is that culture or is that just you not caring?   Well there are many people in the culture who ...   Like men wear pink.   Pink not unusual. Red is more common.   And Sindha's laughing here but if she was being honest she would say that when she was a kid this color palette ...   Well this used to really embarrass me. Now I am proud of it. Sorry.   In the end color was a place that she and her dad were able to meet. And then just keep meeting because the month after Morocco another period more pain. She called her dad. The next month another period more pain. She called her dad. And then the next month?   Yeah.   What are you saying and doing in those moments?   So the first thing I am trying to do is just to get her to be in the color rather than sort of trying to switch it right away. You know can you really feel it?   Yeah I will close my eyes and I will focus in on where the pain is and what it feels like and I let it just kind of shoot up into my brain. And it feels like kind of like if you watched like a watercolor kind of like wash across a page you know? And everything's red all of a sudden. And the first thing I think is Aha! Yeah that is it. Like I have identified it.   Trying to be one with it in a way. And see what do you see what do you feel?   And then I try to just kind of shift the color. It will start like you know changing the tint a little bit into orange and it is like mixing with the red and then pushing it all the way to something different like a pink you know? It is like a wash. And it gets like thicker and thicker and then all of a sudden the wave is coming in a different color.   At this point in the live show we put onto the screen these amazing images. They are hyper-saturated poppy surreal and they are made by Sindha. If you want to see them you can go to Radiolab.orggonads and and check them out. Sindha's inspiration for these photographs is what she sees in her mind's eye when she is in incredible pain and she is able to capture the images and write them down as her dad is coaching her through these color meditations.   Think of the sea think of clouds. Think of blue. Just consider the vastness of the ocean.   Yeah that is a classic.   Goes on and on. And waves come and waves go.   My dad he thinks a lot about the scale of the universe and the scale of all time.   And nothing stays and nothing is permanent.   And our smallness and how insignificant our unhappiness and our suffering is when you think about all of that.   Waves come and waves go.   And he just makes me feel -- it sounds weird because he is very loving but he like makes me feel how little I matter and it calms me down.   Think of waves. The vastness of the ocean. It goes on and on. And waves come and waves go. And nothing stays. nothing is permanent. It all just seems very real and yet it is gone. And it continues. And it is gone. and waves come and waves go. And it is a sea of blue. And then imagine you are one of those bubbles just for once. Your pain is one of those bubbles. It will increase and then it will just pop and be gone. And then more waves will come.   Hmm.   That is cool!   That was good. That was actually realistic.   You still call him?   I always call him.   And how do you like schedule that? Like for you I would almost be like Oh crap! Is today the day she is gonna call? And like how do I book my afternoon?   It is in your calendar.   It was -- yeah it is in my calendar.   What is the ...?   My period is in my dad's calendar.  He is blushing!   That was filmmaker Sindha Agha and her father Gul Agha. We will be back with Radiolab Live Sex Ed. The final episode in the Gonad series.         This is Gonads episode six. This is our live show about Sex Ed. So far we have talked about condom demos without any condoms. Periods. We even went on to talk about the deeply important topic of what happens to all the bananas after condom-banana demos but we ultimately went on to discuss a question that is one of the primary reasons I wanted to do this show.   Anything anything anything is there anything off limits?   What you will find is you can get together a room full of people who you think have the same opinion on what should be taught in Sex Ed in schools but once you boil it down to the nitty-gritty and the fine details you realize everybody draws a line somewhere. And to wrestle with that line drawing we got together a panel of really smart people who think about this and we presented them with real-world scenarios we ran into while reporting this issue and we tried to have them do something where they like waved flags for when they thought a line was crossed or for when they supported the line that was being drawn. I am not sure if the flag thing worked but you may hear reference to it.   And so I would like to welcome to the stage -- I am gonna move. Maybe I should not. I am gonna stand here and then they will come and then I will go. Education historian and author of the Sex Ed book Too Hot To Handle John Zimmerman. Muslim youth activist Dalia. And sex educator Ericka Hart.   Okay. So the first one. December 1st 1994. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders who was appointed by Bill Clinton condoned the idea of teaching schoolchildren to masturbate as a way of avoiding the spread of AIDS. She was asked by Dr. Rob Clark a psychologist at a UN AIDS conference about the prospects of a more explicit discussion and promotion of masturbation as a means to limit the spread of the virus. And she began her reply by saying she was a very strong advocate of Sex Ed in schools at an early age and quote As per your specific request in regard to masturbation I think that is something that it is part of human sexuality and is something that should be taught.   I think masturbation is really really important. And I think that people should learn about it and I feel like it should be like taught as part of like a Sex Ed curriculum. But for this reason? Absolutely not. I think like she really like politicized that reason and it was used not for her own sexual benefits but as like a way to downplay AIDS and be like This is terrible. I do not want anyone to know about this or deal with this. It is like I do not -- this seems like a red flag to me.   Interesting. John?   This episode was completely miscast and misunderstood. It was an invented media non-event. It was cast it was reported as Joycelyn Elders saying that she thought that in schools teachers should teach students how to masturbate. That is not what she was saying. What she was saying was masturbation's a part of human sexuality and people should be informed about that. That is very different than saying we are gonna teach them how to masturbate.   Mm-hmm. Which I would then pose to the panel like would you go as far as doing a how-to in a Sex Ed class? How to masturbate? Or do you just introduce it as an idea?   We are talking about now in K-12 schools?   Well we can talk about what -- if there is a yes in there I would want to know what age. If there is a no I am curious if that is age-related.   You cannot necessarily teach how-to. And I think also speaking to what you said about Joycelyn Elders this is another example of how race and sexuality gets conflated. Or not necessarily conflated but definitely comes to the table that Joycelyn Elders was like literally essentially lost her career talking about this which just shows the anti-Black origins of ever talking about sex and how our bodies are used and on the lines but when we start talking about ways that we can actually own them it is now a problem. And the other part of that is that you do not -- cannot necessarily teach someone how to have -- how to masturbate Cosmo. You cannot really do that because everybody has a different body right? And everybody's bodies function differently. Like for example me I am a breast cancer survivor. I do not have nipples. So to be like Oh you can stimulate your nipples that would be triggering for me because I do not have that body part. But if you just say touch your body in the ways that feel good for you like I told my fifth graders yesterday. And they were like What? Like what does that mean? I am like Any part of your body you can touch and that is called masturbation right? So now they know what it means and there is not this weird thing around this Am I doing it right Miss? Which I get questions about all the time. Like Am I doing it right? I am like Does it feel good to you? Then yes.   This has been a hugely contested question across American history and ...   Masturbation specifically?   Yes specifically. And if you -- if you do not want to read about masturbation do not study sex education because you find it is the most contested subject. And the reason is is it is explicitly and only about pleasure right? It is not about procreation. And even though I expect that many people in this audience think that sex is for pleasure it is important to understand that there are you know some 330 million Americans and not all of them agree with that premise right? Some of them think that it is only reserved for heterosexual marriage and it is only reserved for procreation. And that is why they object to discussions of masturbation because masturbation by definition does not fit that framework.   I was gonna say what is the role that like religion has in this? Because masturbation is so tightly tied to you know I was raised Catholic. Definite no-no right? It is -- it is so tightly tied to that. I wonder how do you respect sort of like religious space when you want to introduce a topic like masturbation?   I mean a lot of my students will say things like well for example God is a man. And I do not necessarily agree with that but I have to kind of hold space for that. That is their understanding of it. So same thing with masturbation where it is like I cannot masturbate because I am Christian or I am Catholic. I am like Okay so you will not masturbate then. But I still have to talk about masturbation as you are in my Sex Ed class. And that is a topic that I am gonna talk about it and not necessarily not talk about because there is some students who are religious. It is like you do not have to opt into everything that I am saying. It is just knowledge for you so you do not go around shaming yourself or someone else for engaging in such behavior.   John?   It is really -- it is really difficult you know? I mean there is shockingly little Sex Ed in this country and there are a lot of reasons for that. But one reason is that we differ so fundamentally about sex and sexuality. You know I mean we are here in lower Manhattan. This is not a representative audience. Okay?   Yeah. Yeah.   And sex is tied to use a loaded word our most intimate ideas of ourselves as human beings. And many of those are faith-inflected you know? And so if you look at Western democracies what you find is people that object sex education now they often cluster among two groups white Evangelical Christians and also recent immigrants especially immigrants from the Muslim and the Hindu world you know? And these are often groups that agree about nothing else but in the UK and Sweden and Canada and the United States every account of their shared objections every newspaper account must use the headline 'Strange Bedfellows.'   Yeah.   I have never seen a single journalistic account -- because it works perfectly right?   Yeah.   I mean these are people that basically agree about nothing including immigration right? But this is hard. And it should be hard for people like myself on the left because we say we value diversity but we also want this thing called comprehensive sex education. How are you gonna square that circle?   Dalia you are nodding. Do you have any thoughts?   Yeah so I was raised Muslim and I think it is not a do not teach your kids about sex. It is more of a it is an unspoken heterosexual we use it to procreate type way. And I hate like feeding into this like American narrative of like Muslims are like all straight cis heterosexuals but I am like fuck ...   They are not!   But I am like we are not. But also that is how a lot of us were raised unfortunately. And like with new generations coming in we are like all queer and whatnot. But -- but it is hard to navigate sex in general let alone masturbation because there is a stigma that is tied not just within the religion but within our own communities depending on where we are coming from.   Okay. So this one happened at a charter school Rocklin California. So kindergarten class a student can bring in a book and the book can be read during story time. And so for one of the weeks a transgender student brought in a book called I Am Jazz which is a book about a transgender kid. The teacher read the book in class. And then there was a really interesting reaction from the parents. Like Holy crap! We were not prepared for this. Our kids came home with -- very confused and tons of questions. And I thought that this was an interesting one because a lot of what we have been talking about is sort of formalized Sex Ed and this is informal Sex Ed.   I do not necessarily think that it is informal per se. I mean it is just about a person's experience. And what cis-normativity does which is cis meaning like the world is very cisgender dominant is like This is weird. Now we are gonna -- maybe we should have had a letter about this. You did not need a letter about talking about George Washington or the Civil War or the Vietnam War or World War II so why is it that when you are talking about a trans person that now you need to be warned that you are gonna talk about this.   Dalia what about you? I know when we were talking backstage you said you could go either way on this one.   Yeah because my only thing my only qualm is like cis people do not know how to facilitate discussions about gender with their kids obviously. Especially if you are in kindergarten and you are asking like Am I a boy am I girl? Like these questions that you are too scared to ask. So I wish that the parents knew about it just so they would be able to facilitate a conversation. So it would have been like a productive experience for the kindergarteners themselves. A letter like if -- a letter would have been okay. Like I am kind of like a letter would have been better because so that way they would have been able to know about this beforehand. So like the kid would not come in at like 00 p.m. and be like I do not know what is happening. This is what happened at school today. So if they knew about it beforehand I feel like it could have been a more productive conversation. Yeah.   John any thoughts?   Look it is really hard. I share the sentiments that we just heard about cis-normativity and I am deeply supportive of trans rights. But I am also supportive of public schools and I understand that they are under threat. All right? And I think that there is a really delicate balance here. If you want people to support your public schools you cannot at the same time transmit the message that somehow they just did not get this thing this sex thing right and we the school have to intervene.   Hmm.   There is a fear. I mean I think -- and what you were saying there is a centering of institutions in this country. It is like oh the institution needs to be upheld. Like oh do not mess up the school. The school is gonna fall apart. And if the school falls apart then we have nothing rather than centering the most marginalized. And I think to think that a school is gonna fall apart but not trans folks and non-binary people and genderqueer people and to not think about their experience is a mindfuck for lack of better words. So I think what is missing in sex education is talking about intersectionality which is not just this celebration of various identities but talking about the ways in which people are impacted by systems of oppression. So actually talking about that when you talk about masturbation is this really something that someone has access to? If you are talking about putting on a condom why is it that Mississippi the poorest country in this country has no -- cannot talk about condoms? Like that is really a function of race and class right? And really being mindful of that and really bringing that into your classrooms and people do not necessarily do that. They are like Oh let us just talk about sex and let us just have this conversation and not be mindful of the things in which like people are also bringing to the table.   Yeah. John?   I agree with all of that. I just think that a true and honest intersectional approach would also acknowledge that a lot of recent immigrants to this country find a lot of these themes anathema do not think they belong in a public school. Believe that they are familial and religious matters and not school matters. I am not saying I agree with them.   Mm-hmm.   I am saying though that an honest intersectional approach would have to acknowledge that. Would have to take account of the fact that we are a diverse society and many of our recent immigrants -- not all but many -- find these themes inappropriate for a public school.   But that is the opposite of what I said. I said it matters that you actually talk about where people are from and that you actually get interested. And if someone is dealing with being documented they probably do not want to talk about masturbation.   As the conversation went on I would not say that we ever actually came to a consensus on any single scenario. And you can feel it gets thorny. But what was brought into the room were all of the different things that go into thinking about how lines are drawn in Sex Ed. So race immigration class maturity body type age. And we went on to discuss other scenarios. Some of my favorites are ...   Bondage in ninth grade?   Introducing bondage to ninth graders.   I am gonna say 12th grade.   Or live BDSM demonstrations.   Attendees were warned ...   Because yes that has actually happened on a college campus somewhere. We are not able to play all those for you here on this podcast but we are gonna do is play you the final segment of the night which is a batch of questions from what is sort of the quintessential Sex Ed target population.   Oh lightning round!   Okay so I will just do a little thing. So last week we heard about this sex educator who made an amazing discovery. This educator was teaching a workshop at a middle school in southern Maine and they were talking to the school nurse. And as they talked they saw that on the nurse's desk there was this like overflowing envelope. And she asked what it was and it turns out the nurse said Oh those are my fifth graders' Sex Ed questions. And so we obviously were like we want those. Thank you very much for telling us this story. And they are pretty great. And so we are coming to the end of the night. And like all Sex Ed classes we have only gotten through about five questions. And so one of the things Sanford tells me that they do is they will do a lightning round where they just try and like whip out answers. So to help us out from The Tonight Show and Comedy Central please welcome our very own self-proclaimed Sex Ed expert Jo Firestone.   Hi!   Do you want to stand far apart or closer together?   I think we should stand here.   Okay!   So Jo.   Yes?   What made you our sex expert?   Well you asked and I just said it. And I do not -- I actually probably have had sex less than everybody here.   But you felt ready to answer these questions.   I mean I figure at that level I think I could handle it. And I just want to say I am very nervous about the speed.   Okay. Okay. It is a lightning round.   I understand.   All right.   It is raining outside. Oh!   Oh okay. I am ready.   Okay. There is no ticking.   Unless you want there to be.   No I do not want ticking.   Ready?   Yeah.   Does breast milk taste like carton milk?   No!   I take long hot tubs. Does that mean I will not make a lot of sperm?   What? I ...   This was not mine.   Right of course. No you have so much sperm.   Yeah.   Yeah do not worry about it. Lots of sperm.   How long do you have sex for?   Two to twenty.     The time of this lightning round.   Yes. Yeah.   I heard my friend lives off donuts and McDonald's. What do I do?   Oh passion and love.   How big can a penis get?   Huge.   Why do we do this anyway?   Because it is -- we do not want to do math.   My mom buys me books that answers my questions. I still want to ask her my questions but I do not want her to get mad. What should I do?   Oh definitely take her out to lunch.   Other girls have developed but I have not. Can I use a cream? I think it is any cream you can think of.   I mean I think creams are always good. Especially in winter. I would say go for it you know?   A little coconut butter?   Yeah it is gonna happen eventually. Just keep it -- you know moisturize it right?   What happens when two sperm reach an egg at the same time?   Twins!   Can people have sex with objects?   Yeah!   How does a girl not get the sperms?   She is shoes them away.   Why do kids start to like each other in fifth grade?   It is exposure. It is just exposure.   You surround them long enough you just start ...   It is a horrible cycle. Home-school them.   How does a penis fit in a vagina?   It is really hard but there is -- there is a lot of maneuvering and I would say use -- use each other.   When girls are still young does milk come out of their breasts when they squash them?   I guess it depends how hard you squash them.   Why do girls have the baby and feed it and help make it and the boys do not have to do anything but help make it?   It is so fucked up it is so fucked up. Yeah.   Yeah.   I do not understand. I wonder that. Can I keep that one?   Yeah. Yeah. This is a rain-related one.   Yes!   Can a penis shrink or grow because of the weather?   Yeah!   Anyone?   Yes?     I have a crush on someone. How do I tell her?   Oh obviously hidden messages. Definitely do not be direct. I would say gifts.   I had the white clear oily substance on my underwear. What should I do?   Oh laundry!   Why when a boy sees a girl he likes his penis hardens and sticks up?   It is the eternal question. And I guess the answer is it is -- the penis is guiding you towards what you should be doing which is your homework.   And that is a show!
