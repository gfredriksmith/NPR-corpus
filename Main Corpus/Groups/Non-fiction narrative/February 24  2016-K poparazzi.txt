   Are you surprised that this is so popular?   Am I surprised? You know what I am surprised about? I am surprised that this morning I was walking to the subway and I was like Man I want to listen to my K-Pop playlist.   I guess I am a little surprised with that myself. Take a note Robert.   And I did listen to it and it was amazing. And I -- it is undeniable.   Okay I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab.   And today -- oh sorry.   No no. You go. Today a story from our reporter Alex Young.   Hi.   Hi!   Well just to set it up this story for us connects to one we did a few podcasts ago about Gary Hart and the moment when how we covered politics changed. This story is about a similar change that is happening right now right in front of our eyes in South Korea.   So we are going to travel a few thousand miles.   Yeah. And in this one all the usual dynamics you would expect in this kind of story get totally flipped.   It is not about politics this time. It is about music and fans.   Yeah.   It is gonna sound a little bit like a music piece as you already heard but really it is a puzzle. If you really admire someone and love them and so on how much do you want to know about -- about them really?   Yeah. Is it tell me everything or tell me nothing? And if someone does try and tell you everything at what point do you say stop? Ready?   I am ready.   Where do -- where should we begin?   Well I think before we get to like the moment that I am very excited about I need to kind of give you guys a little bit of the world in which all of this is gonna happen.   Okay.   Okay.   And so we are gonna start with this woman.   When I tell my friends about it I kind of describe it as a prison but it is a prison you decide to walk into.   Okay so this -- this is Sarah Wolfgang.   I was a former trainee for a K-Pop group in Korea and I am here to talk about that.   Sarah is Korean American. She was born in America.   But I actually grew up in Korea. My parents both worked for the military.   And you were living in Seoul?   Correct.   Okay.   Yongsan Seoul.   And Sarah says that her whole K-Pop adventure it all started for her because when she was growing up ...   I really never liked school.   Mm-hmm.   So my parents were kind of wanting me to do something else. Like they still wanted me to finish school but ...   They encouraged her to try out acting.   To go to auditions try out for school plays. And when I was in high school ...   About 15 years old.   I think maybe 10th grade.   Her headshots ended up getting passed to a South Korean record company.   And when we received the phone call they were like Oh hey you want to come in and audition for a K-Pop group? And I was -- I actually denied it. I really did not want to do it.   Oh.   But then she thought maybe this will lead to an acting job.   So I went in and then they were like Okay. They put me in front of a camera and they were -- they asked me to sing. And I am not the best singer.   But that does not seem to matter to K-Pop.   Nope! Everything you know can be touched up really well.   To make a long story short they end up offering her a contract.   Of more than five years.   And as part of that contract ...   We were asked to move into the dorms.   The what?   They are these facilities that all the agencies have for their idols in-training.   They described it like a boarding school.   All the kids kind of live together.   And so I moved in the dorms with six or seven other girls.   And it was here that Sarah says the company basically kept them under lock and key.   Well they did not lock us in there but we were not allowed to leave. It is like one of those cockroach prisons or like those ant prisons you can walk in but you cannot walk out.   Wait why is she doing this again?   Well let me explain to you guys just like how phenomenally huge K-Pop is.   Okay.   K-Pop actually started in Korea in the early '90s but like in the last five or so years it has just spilled out into the rest of the world. And by some estimates it was generating like around 5-billion a year. And then if you throw in like K-Drama K-Soap Operas which is called the Hallyu Wave that Hallyu Wave in 2012 was valued at 83-billion.   Jesus!   Really?   Yeah. And nearly all of this is based on a kind of fantasy.   Because K-Pop stars are you know products of fantasy world.   That is Professor Suk-Young Kim.   Theater Studies at University of California Santa Barbara. I study K-Pop industry. You know stars are the embodied forms of Manga and Anime and all these unrealistic figures that do not exist in real life. So they have to have just surreally beautiful face beautiful body. You know excessively long legs round eyes pale skin flowing hair. They are not a creature of this world. They should not be you know? They can only exist in fantasy world.   And that fantasy that is what they are trying to manufacture in those dorms.   Like they wanted us to lose weight. So we would wake up at like 00 or 00 a.m. in the morning and then go hiking.   Sarah says after the hike they would come back eat breakfast.   Which usually consisted of lettuce.   Then they would have dance classes singing classes.   And then we have lessons of I think they are called like humble lessons.   Where basically this guy would show up to the dorm.   And he would teach us to bow correctly. So like we would have to bow in unison so that we seemed as like one big happy group.   They were not allowed to have cellphones.   No.   Computers.   Nope.   Or a relationship of any kind.   All companies pretty much do not want you to be in a relationship.   And in fact Suk-Young told me that in 2011 ...   That one of the members of 2NE1 which is a girl group managed by YG Entertainment revealed that their management said they should not be dating before age 29.   What?   They should not be dating because stars belong to the public to the fans.   And that was the thing. It was like a purity thing.   You know that pure angelic virgin Madonna image.   This by the way is K-Pop writer AJ Park.   Editor-at-large at Soompi.com. Like girl groups they used to call them like nation's fairies. You know they had this pure chaste image to them. And the boy bands too. Because that -- being single makes them more marketable and appealing.   And AJ says that is -- that is the main takeaway. Of course there is all kinds of cultural observations that you can make about this but the main driver here is economic. The founders of K-pop knew back in the early '90s that the fans would love the stars even more if the stars were not just beautiful and perfect but they also seemed somehow available.   You would be surprised how many K-Pop stars come out and be like Oh I have never had my first kiss yet.   And they are like 19-20 years old.   Kind of like I have not had my first kiss. Will it be with you? You know feeding the fantasy kind of thing.   But wait. Wait is that all that different than America? I mean did not you feel weirder or stranger or something-er when -- when like I do not know Catherine Zeta-Jones married that guy whatever his name is.   Yeah yeah.   I do not even want to think about his name. Because it changed things for me.   Me too.   I mean I did not have that feeling. I mean I do not know.   What? Come on. What about -- okay you are always going on about Meryl Streep.   Yes.   What did -- is she married by the way?   To me. But she does not know it. She is married to a -- to a very quiet man who is a sculptor you know?   And how does that make you feel?   I lurk around at his shows to see like what does he got that I do not have?    No but that -- my point is that -- I mean American celebrity culture has fantasy woven in too.   Of course. Of course it does.   Yeah but there is a big difference.   In Korea that fantasy world it is so extremely controlled.   Way more than in America according to Suk-Young Kim. And it is controlled not just by the agencies.   But by the fans to the extent that it defies all of our common sense.   What do you mean?   I will give you an example. This one I heard from Professor Suk-Young Kim and also writer Leslie Tumbaco.   I am the editor-in-chief of Seoulbeats.   It is a big K-PopK-Entertainment site. Okay 2008 there was this new girl group.   Girls' Generation.   Called Girls' Generation.   Girls' Generation was a nine-member all-girls group. That was like appearing on like music shows and like variety shows. Being promoted as like the girl next door all cute and you know like the ideal girlfriend kind of idea.   And Leslie says that on some of these shows Girls' Generation would appear with boy bands.   You know who were also promoting at the same time groups such as Super Junior SS501 and DBSK. Okay so these three groups in like various shows they would be like standing next to each other on stage talking to each other during variety shows. And ...   This is where we kind of get into the cultural stuff. There are several times when they are on stage with one or more of these boy bands and they are kind of taking the microphone from the host or whatever and kind of just nodding their head. Whereas the boy bands are like doing these deep bows. Some of the fans are seeing this and they are thinking that is disrespectful.   Why? Why would that be disrespectful?   Well the thinking is that since Girls' Generation is a new group they should be bowing much more deeply than their sunbaes or their seniors.   Being a rookie group is a big deal in Korea because seniority is something that people hold very strongly. And so as a rookie you have to show deference to the superior you know senior groups.   Oh so they are not showing respect.   They are not showing deference.   Just in the bowing?   That is how some of the fans were taking it. But I mean aside from all that and this is the key is that some of the fans thought that the Girl's Generation girls were flirting with some of the boy bands. Like you know like these little sidelong glances or teasing them.   And so that interaction seeing that fans were very very very upset about that. And so all the fans of the three groups ...   The three boy bands.   Got together and decided to do a black ocean.   What is that?   We are gonna get there. We are gonna get there.   Okay.   Fast forward to June 7 2008 all of those bands that were on those TV shows are playing this big K-Pop concert.   This event called ...     Dream Concert.   A huge stadium show. Like more than 40000 fans. And Suk-Young told me that there is one thing you need to know about fans about K-Pop fans at live events. They all have light sticks.   And they come in different colors.   Because each band has its own color.   Super Junior for example has blue. And when they appear on stage you see this sea of blue light sticks waving in support of their stars on stage.   So they played for a while. When SS501 comes out the whole place just turned to light green. Show goes on. TVXQ comes to the stage they were like the biggest band at the time and then up go thousands and thousands of these ruby red glittery lights. And at some point Girls' Generation takes the stage. And here's the thing. Pretty much as soon as they walk on stage ...   All the people in the audience turned off their lights sticks.   What?   Suddenly there was blackout in the whole auditorium.   Everybody stops clapping screaming. Silence.   Are you saying like the whole -- like everybody? 40000 people?   Yes. And if you look up pictures of it it was a stadium performance. The entire stadium was black.   No way!   Yes way! Look at this picture.   Oh my God!   What are we looking at? Oh this is the ...   It is totally black!      It is like a whole football stadium.   Oh my God!   This is not Photoshopped or something?   No because if you look down in the corner you can kind of see the pink Girls' Generation section.   Oh yeah. There is a little box.   Like a little boop of pink.   Pink is their color?   Yeah and then everything else is black.   Girls' Generation had to sing and dance to this silent crowd.   Had anything like this ever happened before?   Never.   Well how on Earth did they pull that off? How could you get this many people doing the same thing?   Okay so the way that these shows happen at least at these Dream Concerts is that different sections of the auditorium belong to different fan groups.   Oh so they sell it as zone seating.   Right. So the fan clubs actually get to like dole out the tickets. And during the show there is this moment where some of the fan club leaders stood up and held up these signs that said Quiet.   Dude!   This is -- this is that upsetting.   Yeah. What do not you understand about this Robert?   Because it seems like -- it does not seem like the most weighty sin I have ever heard. A little blink of an eye a little leaning forward a little failure to bow. But that is just the difference I guess.   Okay wait a second. If you -- if you would allow me to frame for a second.   Yes.   So what have we learned so far? We have learned that this is a global phenomenon.   This is a nightmare. Total nightmare.   It is a global phenomenon born of the nightmare of these stars who seem to be tightly held in check by everybody the fans the agencies everybody. That is what we know so far.   That is what we know so far.   Okay.   And this sort of tight control is how it operated for quite a few decades. But -- and this is why I wanted to do this whole story in the first place -- just a couple years ago in walks this guy and he just messes everything up.     We sent an interpreter with a mic over to the Gangnam District in Seoul.   Gangnam Style.   To speak with a guy named Lee Myung-Joo. But you know he told me to call him Mr. Lee.   Hello?   Hello.   Hey!   I hopped on the line from our studio in New York.   Want to get started?   Yeah are you guys ready?   Yep.   Okay so here's the story.      In the early 2000s Mr. Lee he was working at a news organization called Sports Seoul which did all kinds of things not just sports. They also did like business and entertainment.      He was actually in charge of all the online news. And while he was there I think it is fair to say that he took his reporting very seriously. Like he always had this idea in his mind.      That I believe any contents that can be published that is possible to publish should be freely published. That is the kind of culture that would be better to have.   So he was a guy who believed in an independent press. But he also knew that there were certain things that he just could not report on.      That certain subjects like politics were just dangerous.   How? Why? What are you talking about?   We actually need to back up a little bit. Put this into a little bit of context. So between -- like after the Korean War between say the '60s and the '80s South Korea was under a series of military dictatorships. And there was basically a censorship of the press. Things got a lot better in the '90s when they turn to civilian rule but even today the government still has a branch that goes around the internet and deletes websites for their content. So this is the -- this is like the world in which the press is living in.      So getting back to Mr. Lee. It is 2010 he is at Sports Seoul having dreams of independence and he feels like politics is a little tricky. So he does what to me feels like a little bit of a Trojan horse move.      Basically he says if I cannot do independent reporting in politics I will just sneak it into celebrity news.   Oh!   So ...      So we looked on the internet for Hollywood news and media in the UK and looked at what they were doing.   So he studied The Sun US Weekly TMZ.   Wait he studied TMZ?   That is what he said. You know how they take their pictures? How close do they get?   Because there is not -- there was not paparazzi in Korea. And we decided to apply that to South Korea.   So what kind -- what kind of tactics did you use to get the photos in the first place?   We decided the best way to do the reporting is you know by hiding in the car.   Their first target were these two stars Jonghyun who is an idol from a boy band called Shinee. Huge band. And an actress her name is Shin Se Kyung.   First you have to go through the information-gathering process.   So they tailed both these stars on and off.   For one month.   Whoa!   To get a sense of their movement patterns.   You know and they figure out that they have this pattern of meeting up in front of her apartment really early in the morning like 00 in the morning or something and they take these walks. So late October 2010 ...   It came to a point where we could not miss the opportunity.   They call this -- I guess they call this ...   The D-Day. The dating day.   Which I think is pretty funny. And on this particular day one of Mr. Lee's reporters stakes out the apartment. And the two stars meet up to take their walk and you get the very first paparazzi photos as far as we know in Korea.   Huh. What do these photos look like?   So these photos are so -- well I think they are so cute. It is these two idols you know walking down the street hand in hand under these yellow street lights and they just look like they are in their own little world. There is this one photo where he is pulling back her hair and I think he is putting like an earbud in her ear and they are maybe they are sharing a song they are listening to a song together.   Aww!   He is got her purse on his shoulder. You know he is just holding her bag for her.   What happens when the photographer guy runs up and goes click click click click click in their face?   Well the guys at Sports Seoul kind of drew this line. They were like we are gonna keep back a distance from the celebrities.   Oh so there is a silent click click click coming through a car window.   Right.   Do they see the guy?   No they do not. And that is why these photos they are -- it is not like that typical like hands in the face photo. They just look totally serene.   At this moment these two innocents are truly innocent. They have no reason to expect anyone to be out there at all.   Right. Because you know before this moment there were not paparazzi photographers stalking celebrities like this.   This is Eden right here. This is Eden.   Yeah this is ...   Just before the fall. Let us move onto the fall!      Mr. Lee said right before they published and this has sort of become their tradition all of the reporters got together and stayed in the office all night. And everybody was on pins and needles because you know they did not know. They did not know what was gonna happen. Are people gonna be outraged? Are they gonna be totally excited about this? They just had no idea what was gonna happen.   And you also will have no idea what is gonna happen. Until after the break.       Jad. Robert. Radiolab. Back to our story from reporter Alex Young.   So when we left off we were talking about Lee Myung-Joo. Mr. Lee. And he and his team had just captured the first paparazzi moment in South Korea. They had taken a picture of these two stars.   The photos were pretty dark and ...   Super grainy.   Totally paparazzi-style. Like shot in the night. Probably from a zoom lens like thousands of yards away. It was hard to tell the photographs really.   He says that they all got together in their office. They were just about to publish no idea what was gonna happen.   And when we first published them ...   Nothing.   Really?   Really?   Yeah.   Seriously?   Oh come on! I am kidding!   The general response was ...   People went crazy!   Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. The photos went viral. It just took the whole country. There was an incredible amount of web traffic. Like so much that our servers were breaking down.   So people clicked.   Oh yeah. When it all comes down to it people really want to know. At first they just -- you know they just inundated the website trying to look at these photos. But then they were like Oh! Oh no! So then they rushed over to the fan sites and four of the websites from the boy band the guy crashed. Shin Se Kyung's website which is called a minihompy page it just gets flooded with comments.   Rumors vile comments about how the fans felt betrayed.   People were like posting defaced pictures of her.   In typical sexist ways she got the brunt of it.   This is always the way it is right? Just like in America that is the way it happens in Korea.      You know when I talk to Lee Myung-Joo he -- he was the first one to recognize that. Usually when this kind of scandal breaks it is the woman who gets it worse.   Yeah. Yeah. So how -- how did the agencies respond?   Shock. In the beginning you could tell that the companies were not prepared because their official statement would be like We need to talk to the celebrity about this. Or We had no idea this was going on. And you could see that the companies were struggling.   There is actually you know a couple times later on where God the fans got really crazy. And they would actually protest at like their live shows or whatever. And then pretty much the next day like after the protest the idol at the center of that scandal would just kind of vanish. Like they would just take a indefinite hiatus from all their like promotional activities.   Like you mean like the agencies just yanked them?   I mean yeah. That was the suggestion yeah.   And did the agencies say anything about that to you?   No one would go on the record with me but I did talk to some people over email and they said that you know when fans react this way they are kind of forced to take drastic action.   So they kind of confirmed that they were disappearing idols?   They confirmed with me that they were taking action.  But here's what ends up happening.      Lee Myung-Joo says you know that very first scandal that they broke yeah they got a lot of backlash but it showed them that ...   What worked in the foreign media could also work in South Korea. So it gave us strength to keep experimenting.   So in 2011 Lee Myung-Joo and like a couple of the people from Sports Seoul they break off and they form this company called Dispatch. And then the following years 2012-2013 this is a really important chunk of time where they just start pumping out scandals.   We must have done more than 10 stories small and big. Do you want to hear the list?   I do want to hear the list.   First off There is Park Jeong she is dating Mr. P. Then there is Goo Hara who is with Junhyung. Then there is Tachyon who gets caught with Jessica. Rain dating Kim Tae Hee. And you have Yuna dating Lee Sun Hee. Sulli that was like a crazy one. And of course we all remember Baekhyun and Taeyeon.   I do not remember.   Oh I remember. But according to see Suk-Young Kim you had so many scandals and such a short period of time.   Headlines after headlines after headlines at such a frequent rate that we fans became somehow desensitized by this news.   It shook us. And I am going to put myself in there now yeah. It shook us.   According to writer AJ Park what you saw after this crazy onslaught of scandals is well a couple things. So the paparazzi ...   Became a trend something that all the Korean entertainment news started picking up.   There starts to be all these other paparazzi companies that come out.   Competitors?   Exactly. Just like Dispatch but with a different name. But the craziest part I think is that you start seeing celebrities tiptoeing out and telling the truth about their lives.   Little by little the celebrities would get more comfortable about revealing it themselves.   For instance in 2012 on this talk show ...   Kwon Hee who is a member of this K-Pop boy band he made waves because he explained that celebrities date in cars.   In order to get away from all these new paparazzi ...   They park by the Han River and they have their dates there.   And there are parking lots where multiple celebrities park and have their secret dates inside the car. This is something that people always sort of suspected was the case ...   But it was kind of like the first time it was just out in the open like that.   And I think that the audience reaction is like super telling because you can hear it in the tape they are laughing.   So he is breaking the spell and what you expect is Gasp!   Yeah.   And what you get is ...   Casual laughter.   So that is a sea change.   That is a real sea change. So -- and this happened in just two years you are saying?   We probably have to say five years.   Yeah but still I mean that is -- see this actually does make me think I mean well first of all it is interesting to think of paparazzi as liberators. In this case.   Totally totally.   Because we are used to think of them as like scum. But I mean if you pan out here's literally the thought I am having. Like there is a tendency because we are dumb westerners to sort of see what happens in places like Korea as being very different from us. Like culturally separate.   Yeah.   But this -- to hear that they change that quickly makes me think in some way that we are all very similar.   Hmm.   Or maybe we are all headed to the same place and like tabloid is the great equalizer. And maybe we are all gonna just end up all of us in post-Kardashian hell. Like literally this is how far they traveled in five years and literally in another five years you will have the Kardashian family of Korea.   Right right right.   Just dishing all the time and making sex tapes on their own or whatever it is.   I also thought the same thing. You know being from America you are like well this is just inevitable. But I -- I actually do not think so anymore.   Hmm.   AJ told me a story that really changed my mind.   It was like -- it was our Watergate. It was our K-popgate. It was -- it changed everything.   This story it revolves around this one young female solo artist Ailee. She is just hugely popular. I mean they actually call her the Korean Beyonce and in 2013 she was just killing it. By this point Ailee has a couple albums out her YouTube videos have millions and millions of views. But then in November 2013 a bomb drops.     What happens is this guy cold calls Dispatch. Mr. Lee actually picks up and he recorded this phone call between them. And the guy tells him I have nude pictures of Ailee. Mr. Lee tells the guy We need to know how you obtained these. The guy says I received them. From who? The singer. The singer gave them to you? Yes. Why? I was her boyfriend.   What exactly is he asking?   So he is calling Dispatch to see how much these nude photos are worth. And when I was talking to Mr. Lee about this he said that in that moment when he was on the phone ...   As a reporter I was greedy about the story and the information.   He said that he wanted those pictures. But what he ends up telling the guy is We do not want your photos. And then if you keep listening to the phone call you can hear him start getting really upset with the ex-boyfriend. Like This is not right. You are crossing a line. So to make a long story short Dispatch turns down the photos and the photos somehow make their way to a competitor's website.   This one American K-Pop website called AllKPop who was pretty big. They were probably the number one K-Pop site at that time.   In the world?   For English speakers.   Oh for English speakers. And they published the naked pictures.   They are the ones who published the naked pictures.   Cannot remember if they censored it or not but if they did it was not a very good job. Like you could see.   So the photos come out. And what would you expect to happen?   Some anger maybe? A little bit? And then basically people just click on the pictures.   No. What actually happens is instantly the entire K-Pop world bands together black ocean-style and just comes out against AllKPop. The agencies they start threatening to sue this competitor website starts this boycott. And in just a few days the figure was like 22000 Twitter followers just stopped following them. Really their -- their reputation just tanks.   It was a warning to them. You know do not mess with us. And so they really have not -- I mean I have not really followed them in a while but they have not recovered since then.   But what I think is the most surprising part of this is just three days after the photos come out was the night of one of South Korea's biggest award ceremonies called the Melon Music Awards. And you know scheduled for that night Ailee was supposed to receive one of these Top 10 Artist of The Year awards. And I think to everyone's surprise she actually showed up. And about two hours in ...     You know they call her name and she stands up walks to center stage goes to the presenters. She takes a bow and she looks -- I think she looks fraught or at least overwhelmed. But then she faces the crowd. At one point her face kind of cracks. She puts her head in her elbow and she starts crying. She says It really means a lot to me that you supported me that you believed in me despite everything that is going on. Thank you. And then she walked off stage.   For me this story shows that they are gonna draw a line in the sand that is different from ours.   For now. Or for a long time? Or can you say?   I mean when I asked AJ Park the same question ...   Do you think that it is going to go the way of the west?   I mean she said no way.   I do not think it is ever gonna be that way.   Why not?   I mean culturally Koreans we are a little more strict. And also I think there is also a part where we look at the U.S. and we are like Come on guys. You know like we see them as an example of let us not totally go there.   So like the U.S. is a cautionary tale or something?   Yeah like do not ever get to that point guys.   And maybe this is one of those ones where you really wonder like is there a cultural difference that runs deep enough that you can say 'shh' to the part of you that says I want to know I want to see I want to hear. And I ...   You think that that ultimately there might be a ...?   I do not know.   Part of me thinks that as the -- when it gets so easy to know the most intimate details about anyone we will all give in. I do not know there is part of me that just feels that way about humans.   Yeah I do not know. I have to go with Robert on this one.   Well I am gonna have to go with Ailee.   Oh me too.   Thank you Alex.   Thank you.
