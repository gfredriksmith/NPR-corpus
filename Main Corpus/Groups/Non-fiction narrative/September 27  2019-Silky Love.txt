       All right Bobby. Would you like to -- would you like to do it?   Yeah. Go ahead and start me and I will just go -- I will just take it through.   Okay.   Three two one. Hey I am Jad Abumrad   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab.   And today I have brought us a little -- a little story.   Hello!   Lucy?   That is ...   Robert!   Oh great! Okay ...   A sort of slippery mystery.   Slippery mystery. Okay.   And the mystery comes from this woman Lucy Cooke.   I am the author of The Truth About Animals.   And it is a rip-roaring ...   Which is filled with strange stories.   It is really -- like we are like feasting on this book. Okay.   So Lucy -- so Lucy wrote a book and the book is actually a collection of animal profiles which come from her journalism.   And I just -- I love it. I love it a lot. And so I called her up and we just started talking about ...   Frogs.   All sorts of animals.   Bats.   Sloths.   The island of dwarf stone sloths in Panama.   I have no idea what that means.   We talked about birds.   Birds are like turtles?   No no no no no!   We talked about ...   If you are a female panda ...   Bears.   What you are really looking for in a male panda is one that can squirt his pee quite high up a tree.   But what I really wanted to talk to Lucy about ...   Well I am gonna stop right there and switch quickly to eels.   Was eels.   Because we only have 33 minutes left and I do not want to ...   Oh my God and the eel's so good.   And the eels are so good.   Because as you will soon learn the story of the eel is really -- and this is strange to think about -- the limits of human knowledge.   Yeah are you ready to rock and roll?   You could just start with like tell me when you first -- you know first encountered this creature.   Oh I was a very geeky only child and what I loved to do more than anything else in the world was my father sunk an old Victorian bath into the garden and that became my Narnia. And I would sort of disappear into this watery kingdom and you know was obsessed with creating the perfect pond ecosystem out of this rather sterile tub for human ablution. It became my -- it was -- it was -- it was everything to me. So every Sunday I would nag my dad. Can we go to the ditches of Romney Marsh? Please Dad! And he would sort of take me off and we would go. He made me a net to catch things with out of a pair of old net curtains that I would sort of trawl through the ditches of Romney Marsh and catch all these wonderful creatures. You know pond skaters and newts and frogs and -- and I would bring them back to my -- my tub. But eels became my holy grail because the thing about eels -- I do not know Robert have you ever tried to catch one?   No I would never even think to try to catch them because they are ucky and slimy and they remind me of snakes.   Yeah. No I wanted to because I wanted to have all animals much like Noah. I wanted all animals to be represented in my pond.   You had a list!   Yeah I had a list. And the eel it was impossible. I caught them but then trying to grab them with my own bare hands was always a complete disaster because they are as you say extremely slippery. They would just slither out of my hands and then shoot off in the grass more like a snake than a fish out of water.   But had I managed to get eels to join my -- my happy pond party I would have been a little bit horrified because I now know they would have eaten all the other guests because they are voracious predators and they will eat any other creature that they can get their mouths around including each other.   Which Lucy explained was proven rather graphically in a famous 1930s experiment in France.   Yeah. So basically in the 1930s there are a couple of researchers in Paris who placed a thousand elvers which are young eels they are about three inches long in a tank of water. And they fed them every day. But even so after a year of the 1000 elvers there were only 71 left.   Because they all got sick and died or what?   No. They ate each other. And so the 71 survivors a year later were three times as long as they were before. And then three months later after what a local journalist reported as daily scenes of cannibalism there was one champion that was left and it was a female -- whoo-hoo! -- measuring a foot in length. And she lived four more years on her own and could have lived a lot longer if the Nazis had not invaded Paris and inadvertently cut off her supply of worms and she died.   So ...   Those Nazis have got a lot to answer for. The eel story has got it all.   It does. It has everything.   It is got it all. It is even got Naz -- it is got Freud it is got Nazis. It is got an international gonads championship. It is got everything.   Wait. International gonads championship.   Yes yes. Because there has been and there still is a very simple question we have been asking about eels and that is where do they come from?   That is a question?   Yes. People have been fishing them and eating them and hunting them and studying them as you are about to find out forever and ever and ever. For such an important animal it is remarkable it has kept the secret of its origins from every human being.   Wait how can it be -- how can it -- how can that be that -- how can that be true?   It is not for lack of trying.   It is taken a very very very long time to try and figure out the mysteries of the eel.   And Lucy says this question where do eels come from?   That is something that has tormented men of science since Aristotle. So he thought that eels were spontaneously generated by the action of water on mud and that the worm casts that we see in sand were actually embryonic eels boiling out of the earth.   Wait a second. So water would slap slap slap slap slap against seashore rocks or sand or something and then -- squirt! -- up would pop an eel?   Yeah. Exactly. That was -- that was Aristotle's solution. That was not his finest hour. And then the great Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder he thought that eels rubbed themselves against rocks and the scrapings came to life.   You mean like it is dandruff? Like eel dandruff? Like rub rub rub rub -- boing! -- I have got a baby?   Exactly yeah. The ideas of where they came from were utterly fanciful. You know there was one Reverend Bishop who claimed in the Middle Ages that he would seen eels being born out of the thatching of his roof. There were others that thought that they came from dewdrops but only at certain times of year.   Well what about when you get a microscope? Like these are the superstars of science. So van Leeuwenhoek he looked at them right? So he could have seen it.   Yeah. So he thought that they gave birth to live young like mammals do because he sort of got his microscope out and he looked inside an eel and he thought he saw little baby eels swimming around inside a bigger eel. But actually what he would seen were parasitic worms inside a swim bladder. So he was wrong.   What about Carl Linnaeus? As long as we are dealing with the great -- Linnaeus who categorized all life did he have an eel idea?   Yeah he did. He thought that they were -- gave birth to live young. But the unfortunate thing was that he was actually looking at the wrong creature. It was not an eel. It was a very similar-looking fish called an eelpout which is a completely unrelated type of fish. So he was very wide of the mark.   So let me just -- let me get rid of the clutter of all of these non-Italians. Because in your story it turns out that Italians are the ones for -- I guess because they are -- they have eels in their rivers they just thought We have got to figure this out. I noticed that Leonardo in The Last Supper are the disciples eating eel for their Passover Seder? Is that what is going on there?   I believe so. I think there are -- there are eels on the table in the painting of The Last Supper.   Okay.   So I mean the Italians who are very good with food took a great interest in the riddle of the origins of the eel. And at a time in the 18th century while Italy at that time was a load of warring states there was no sort of sense of national identity. And the -- there were a sort of small band of Italian scientists who decided that somehow that they would -- they would forge an identity for their nation not through revolution but by finding the gonads of the eel. It is a novel approach to politics.   Yes! Did they succeed in Italianizing the gonad? Like did they find them in Italian eels?   Oh they made a lot of attempts basically. So it started in 1707 when a local surgeon found an unusually plump eel amongst the many thousands that were caught every day on the Po River delta. And he sliced it open and he saw what he thought was an ovary and eggs and he sent this pregnant fish to his friend the esteemed naturalist Vallisneri who hastily proclaimed the centuries-long search for the evils -- the evils? -- the eels' private parts was finally over. And unfortunately he was wrong. But this then sort of ignited this interest amongst the Italian scientific establishment who decided it was a matter of extreme importance to find the true ovaries of the eel and they came up with this plan. They thought I know what we are going to do. All we have to do is put out there a reward.   Like if you find the gonads of an eel you will get a thousand ducats.   Exactly. So what happened was they got an eel stuffed with eggs but unfortunately the wily fisherman had filled his eel with the eggs from another fish.   Oh! He cheated. He put in another -- oh!   Yeah he cheated. So there was a bit of a blow for the Italians' gonad hunt. And that went on pause for about 50 years. And then in 1777 a fresh fat slimy suspect flopped up on the shores of Comacchio and it was examined by the great anatomist Carlo Mondini who was a professor at the nearby University of Bologna. And he realized that the frilled ribbons inside the eel's abdomen were not fringes of fatty tissue which is what they would previously thought but they were the female eel's evasive ovaries. So bingo! Ovaries found.   Wait. Frilled fringes. What exactly did the ovaries look like?   So if you think of a -- if you think of seaweed.   Mm-hmm.   When you open up a female eel there is a little place in the middle of her tummy that looks like little wispy bits of flesh with little dots on the end.   Oh that look like seaweed.   Yeah.   That is the ovaries?   Yeah. Turns out that those are their ovaries.   How did they -- how did they miss that?   I do not know. You know I think you -- they do not look like anything like mammalian ovaries they do not look like other fish ovaries so they just -- they were hiding in plain sight.   And so then the male ovaries do you have any sense of what those ...?   The male testes they are called.   The male testes I am sorry. Yeah male testes.   Testicles still missing though. And what is amazing about the eel story which is just absolutely extraordinary is we now have another character who turns up. The mission to complete the eels genital jigsaw you might say fell to an unlikely character Sigmund Freud.   He is an eel hunter?   Well he was a student at the time at the University of Vienna and it was his first ever academic job was he spent a summer trying to track down the testicles of the eel. He was -- he was investigating the claim of a Polish professor who had claimed that he had discovered the testicles of the eel but he had not saved them or he had not used a microscope or for some reason there was no proof. So Freud was given the task of proving this claim. So for weeks every day from 00 in the morning until 00 in the afternoon in a hot smelly laboratory he sliced open long phallocentric fish in search of their testicles. Freud was completely consumed by it and -- and failed. He just -- he could not substantiate this Polish professor's claims and he moved on to look for the seat of desire in -- in another animal namely the human.   So Lucy says now jump ahead about 30 years to around the 1890s.   A male eel finally exposed itself. And it was to this chap Giovanni Grassi.   An Italian biologist who one day ...   Found an eel swimming off the coast of Italy.   Scooped it up brought it back to his lab cut it open. And saw finally and with certainty this is a little cloudy -- cloudy how he knew this but he said Yup. These are the right things. This is the testes and those are the sperm.   Nothing short of miraculous.   So did he get a big like -- a prize? A reward?   Well I like to think that there was an enormous great big cup shaped like a pair of testicles.   Okay let us just plop -- let us just keep that thought in our heads and move on.   But okay. So testes located ovaries located.   Right.   Two great mysteries of nature solved.   But there is another one. There is another even bigger one.   Mm!   Where do they go to do this thing? Where the testes and the eggs go -- squick squick -- and make a baby?   What do you mean? Where like in the water?   In the water yes.   But ...   But where on Earth?   Huh.   On Earth Jad. That turns out to be an even deeper mystery. That is after the break.     Radiolab. Okay so Robert you left us with the eel mysteries one and two solved.   We know where their sex parts are yeah.   Testes located ovaries located.   Right. Now you want to know how they have sex and where they have sex.   I do not -- it is funny I did not -- I mean now that you ask the question I do want to know the answer but I was not ...   Well this has proven to be Jad a very hard question. And it was only a while ago that we found a clue.   Grassi was on a bit of a roll. So he would found the testicles of the eel.   And the clue was found by our Italian scholar Grassi.   He does something incredibly ingenious because as early as the 1850s there were these tiny weeny transparent fish the shape and thickness of a willow leaf with bulbous black eyes and these -- grrr! -- snaggly gruesome buck teeth had been documented washing up in huge numbers on the shores of Italy. And these sort of minuscule monsters were just sort of dismissed as just another one of the many many millions of nondescript marine creatures that inhabit the sea. But Grassi he thought to himself I think that those are actually -- they are not an adult fish. They are a larvae of a fish.   Oh so they are a baby. I just do not know what they are about to grow up and to become.   Yeah. And what he did that was so incredibly clever was that he counted their vertebrae and it averaged at about 115. And then he looked for a match in an adult species of fish and he found it in the European freshwater eel. It is just an -- an amazing piece of biological detective work I think.   And it revealed that baby eels were living along the coastlines and then washing into the mouths of rivers all over the world. Italy and Spain and Japan and ...   And where are we right now?   The great state of New York.   We are on the Fall Kill Creek in Poughkeepsie New York where this creek enters the Hudson River.   We have eels right around here in New York City.   We do.   We do. In Poughkeepsie.   About 75 miles north of New York City.   So our producer Becca Bressler and I went up to Poughkeepsie to meet this man Chris Bouser.   I am the Hudson River estuary educator for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation.   And Chris explained to us when these tiny little baby eels ...   Like little pieces of transparent linguine.   ... arrive in the Hudson River ...   They are only about two inches long. And they arrive here by the hundreds of thousands. And then they quickly when they get here?   They start transforming.   Going through these physiological changes that makes puberty look like a kid's birthday party what these eels go through.   Basically these little eels settle down at the bottom of the river.   And blend in with the river bottoms.   And grow ...   And grow ...   And grow and grow and grow and grow and grow.   There is only one way to see how big the eels in there are and that is to go in there and see them. We want to catch you some adult eels. Or ...   I am happy to do it. Not exactly happy to do it. I am just kind of ...   Or if you would rather just get the eels our team can go ahead and get them right now.   No no no no. I am not gonna wuss out on this. I am gonna do this.   Keep going then.   Okay.   Just keep going.   But let me ask you. Like the first time you actually touched one with your own hands what -- tell me what it felt like?   Silky love. People think of eels as being slimy. No they are satiny silky. They just feel like these beautiful muscular well-adapted miracles of evolution. You cannot touch an eel or hold an eel in your hand without feeling some weird love and wisdom coming to pass.   Do you have any brothers and sisters?   I do. They think I am strange.   Okay. So ...   How am I gonna catch anything with these rubber gloves?   Ah! Here comes Aiden to show you how.   Chris and a few of his colleagues and Becca and I we put on these canvas overalls rubber boots rubber gloves.   This is for you.   And we were given nets.   Oh!   This is what we are gonna be using to catch the eels.   Okay.   Scoop them with that net!   Okay.   And one of the researchers she was netless. Instead she had this long metal rod that connected to a backpack.   When -- I am going to turn the backpack on. Whenever the backpack is on it is putting electricity in the water. So ...   Basically electrical current comes out of the backpack into the metal rod into the water ...   To gently stun and coax these eels out of their hiding places.   And once that happens that is my cue to grab one.   All right. So is everybody ready?   Ready. Yes.   Sarah Monk you are in charge. Sarah Monk's giving directions now.   And so we walked out deeper into the creek.   Okay. We are now mid-creek.   And eventually we stopped. And Sarah the researcher with the backpack ...   All right. Backpack on.   ... sent some electricity into the water. And ...   There is an eel!   Up they came.   Oh there is one right there. There you go.   One after another these long shiny creatures slithering through the water.   There is two eels in here.   Some of them are over three feet long. So I tried to net one.   Oh! That was not a small one! Whoa! Almost had it.   Wait before you do that. Everybody look up here and smile just because it is a great picture. Go get them!   Everybody ready?   But I just kept missing and missing ...   But I did not catch any.   ... and missing. Until finally in my net a two-foot long shiny eel.   If you want to take your glove off and touch it with your bare hand you are welcome to.   Yes I would love to.   You can feel that silky smooth ...   Silky love coming my way. If I can get off my rubbery glove for the silky love. Okay mister eel. Ooh yeah it is kind of -- it is kind of silky. Yeah. Oh he does not feel bad at all. What do you think little fella?   Do you feel any danger?   No. I am going to call her Florence. Florence the eel. Hey here's your tail.   I should say that eels can survive out of water even crawl through the grass for hours. But eventually I did let Florence go back into the water only to learn from Chris and his team that Florence was not actually was not a Florence. That Florence in fact was not either a male or a female. Because this particular eel did not have ovaries or testes. And in fact most of the eels that we saw on that day in the river did not have ovaries or testes and were all sexless.   Hmm.   Because this is the thing that happens the world over is that when eels are in rivers they hang out they grow they get bigger and they are waiting essentially for this moment that comes almost at the midnight hour of their lives. It is -- it is like the ringing of a bell. When just as they are about to get their long-awaited ovaries and testes they come up from the bottom of the riverbed and then they make their way down the river and back out into the sea. And then they just disappear. You cannot find them.   What do you mean they just disappear? They -- like they cannot follow them?   They cannot be followed.   Oh is that why it was so hard for them to find the sex parts because maybe the ones they were finding ...   Well they had to find an older one yeah.   That did not have them yet.   Yeah.   Oh that explains a lot of it. Yeah.   So they are like the opposite of salmon. Salmon start in the -- in the rivers and go down to the sea. Spend a long time in the ocean and then come back up the rivers. This is the -- eels are the un-salmon.   Oh interesting.   They -- they start in the ocean somewhere. They go up to the rivers they get big and mature then they head back to the ocean somewhere. The question is where?   Oh interesting.   Nobody knows! I mean this is weird. Like ...   Do they all go to the same place?   Well you will find out.   Okay all right. Well shall I -- shall I try and tell the story of Johannes Schmidt very quickly then?   So back to those early days of scientific eel-hunting in the late-1800s nobody had seen an adult eel out in the sea strange as that may be. But then there is this guy ...   Oceanographer Johannes Schmidt.   Who thought Well wait a second. The eels we know go out somewhere into the ocean die and have babies. We see those babies showing up at the tops of rivers all over the world so let us track the babies backwards he thought. Starting with the biggest ones then look for smaller babies then smaller babies still. And the smallest smallest babies will probably be right at the nest where the parents die and those babies are born.   It is worth noting that Johannes Schmidt was described as being and I quote Pathologically ambitious.   Because remember what Schmidt's looking for are these tiny tiny little eels.   The shape and thickness of a willow leaf.   Like a three-inch long translucent piece of wiggly flesh. So small. And we are talking about the Atlantic Ocean. So like how are you gonna pull this off?   Well he had rather fortuitously -- he would just married the heiress to the Carlsberg Brewery and they were probably the best lager company in the world for an aspiring oceanographer to hitch his wagon to because they were known to fund ocean exploration. So he would married the heiress and then he was then because he had all these funds he was able to spend after she would married him he then disappeared to sea for 20 years.   20 years!   Combing the world's oceans.   From Cairo and Alexandria all the way to Virginia.   With progressively finer nets.   Looking for smaller and smaller and then smaller baby eels.   His breakthrough came in 1921 when he found one that was a quarter of an inch long which he presumed could be no more than a day or two old.   And Schmidt found this eel ...   Slap-bang in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle.   In the Sargasso Sea. First of all it is so far away from Italy and Spain and Europe it is kind of near the Carolinas off North America. And it is a very strange place.   It is unusually salty. It is filled with an underwater forest of sargassum seaweed and very very very deep. I think at some places it is four miles deep.   Whoa!   It is the only sea the only thing we call a sea that does not have land around it. It is this zone of very quiet water surrounded by roaring currents going in a big circle around it.   And the idea is this is the place where all eels come to have their babies?   No not all eels. Because there is eels all over the world. But for the Atlantic eel the Sargasso is the place. At least that is -- that is the theory. Because since Schmidt's big discovery in 1921 we have been trying to confirm it. So for instance a few years ago scientists in Europe tagged 400 eels to see where they would go. They went into the Mediterranean but most of them died and very few got out into the Atlantic. And you know a few of them went kind of wandering toward Africa. Then a year ago roughly there was another story about a single tagged eel.   Can you tell me the story of that eel?   I sure can.   It was an eel that started up in the St. Lawrence River in Canada who would eventually become a female eel.   She heads south sniffs around. According to the tag she then heads due east.   Heads first towards Scotland then reverses her way back to Maine.   And starts a quick beeline south. I do not mean south-ish. I mean south. South like she is following one of the magnetic longitudes of the planet. She heads down and somewhere at the edge of the Sargasso Sea the tag comes off. We do not know if it falls off we do not know if it was eaten. We do not know what happens. All we know is that is the end of the road of the tag but the fate of that female eel we do not know.   Exactly. And we do not know because even today -- and in fact I got an email yesterday from perhaps the world's leading eel scientist and he explains to me that sadly after many many many years much effort and millions of dollars spent still no one had managed to actually track an eel all the way from the rivers of Europe to the Sargasso.   But they tried right?   Exactly. They -- they sunk swollen eel temptresses into the Sargasso hoping that they would attract males and they could catch them in flagrante and then finally prove that -- that definitely it was observed eels mating. But still it is never been seen it is never been witnessed.   Maybe the guys are not there. Maybe they got the wrong place. Or maybe the guys are shy or maybe the guys know a science experiment when they see one and are just not gonna tell. I do not know which of those three.   Or they are actually breeding on the moon and falling out of the sky raining on the Sargasso. We cannot -- we cannot rule that out.   We do not know where exactly. We do not know how exactly. But somewhere in the Sargasso Sea there is the miracle of a fertilized eel egg.   Miracle because no one's ever seen it?   Correct. Ever.   In the wild.   There is a secret sauce with eels that we have not solved. Forget the Coca-Cola recipe eel sex is the real mystery of our generation. And we think we know roughly where in the Sargasso Sea it happens but that is a think not a know. We have never witnessed in the wild eel egg fertilization.   Well I know you are not an eel. So let me ask you like have you imagined where all the -- let us assume for the sake of argument that there is a place that Atlantic eels go to and it is a place where they have sex and it is a place where they have babies and it is a place where they die. In your imagination what does that place look like? Speaking as a human.   In my imagination and make sure that line makes it in  in my imagination and again this is without any proof but in my imagination I like to think of some deeper waters of the Sargasso Sea somewhere between Bermuda and Puerto Rico. It is a quiet place. It is a dark place. It is beyond the reach of all but the barest of wavelengths of light up top. And I think that with these eels you know I have often wondered do they pair off discreetly? Is there sort of a massive orgy of eels that happen? And I like to think of eels as once they get there there is got to be some sort of primitive ichthyological celebration that feeling of My gosh! I have finally accomplished a 30-year 3000-mile journey! All of us have! But I am gonna go back to what we were talking about how much I love the mystery. I do not like to overthink it.   Oh you do not want to even think about this.   I do not want to overthink it. Because again I almost respect and love the mystery so much that I see like in the eel movie right? Fade to black. Cue the music the fireside lighting you know? Slow dissolve. Fade to black. Tah-dah.   This piece was produced by Becca Bressler and Matt Kielty. Special thanks to the men and women of the Hudson River Estuary Program who helped us with this project and brought their equipment and their bodies and -- and their strange clothing down to the creek. And to Clay Hiles of the Hudson River Foundation who set us up with these folks and to Kim Airstrup.   And to all eels that are on the cusp ...   Yes.   ... of that great journey into the unknown.   Who still will not tell us what they know.   Deep -- deepwater nursery ...   Yeah. Thank you eels.   ... of mystery.   Yes.   Keep doing it eels. Keep doing it.   And they are doing it by the way right around now. So it is in the -- in hurricane season.      So for a variety of reasons these animals are just not telling.   Okay.   We gotta say goodbye now.   Okay. I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich. Thanks for listening.        Copyright  2019 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved.
