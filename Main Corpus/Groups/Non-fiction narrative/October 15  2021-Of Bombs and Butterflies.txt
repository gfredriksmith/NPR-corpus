  I will start. No no. I think you should start because this is your story.  Okay. I am Latif.  I am Jad.  This is Radiolab and today we have been working on this story a long time and it feels kind of disproportional because it is likeit is a big story about a little thing.  Yeah. I am gonna pretend I do not know what the little thing of which you speak. What is this story that you are about to tell me and about what?  This story is about a tiny fragile critter doing its best to survive in a hostile world and whether we should help it or let it die.  Damn. Okay.  Okay so let us begin with ...  Okay numbers are running at the bottom. And I will just use this like a phone.  Nick Haddad.  So maybe let us just start with a phone call I think right?  Yeah start from the beginning.  Early 2000s Nick is sitting in his office.  North Carolina State University.  This was actually his first job as a professor.  Yeah I was a professor in zoology.  Still pretty new. Young guy. And one day he is sitting in his new office when the phone rings. And on the other end of the line is someone from Fort Bragg the US army base. He was like Why the hell is the army calling me?  Yeah when I got a call from the army I for sure furrowed my brow.  The first thing the army guy says is Look there is this endangered butterfly on our base.  The thing's on the precipice of extinction.  And we need your help to save it.  Why would the army care about this one butterfly?  Well because this butterfly you cannot find it anywhere else. Fort Bragg is its only known habitat on planet Earth. Since it is listed as endangered the military has to save it. Like that is the law that is the Endangered Species Act. Which is why they are calling someone like Nick Haddad to try to help them save it. Now Nick he is an ecologist he is a conservationist but ...  I am not an entomologist. I do not know much about other insect species.  Technically he is not even a butterfly guy.  Had you heard of that butterfly before?  I had never heard of the butterfly before. At the time I probably could have named one rare butterfly. Everything else was you know just common.  So he looks this thing up you know just to see what he is working with. And the name of this butterfly is the Saint Francis' satyr.  Is that a 'D'seder?  S-A-T-Y-R. Satyr.  Oh! That sounds like a mythological creature.  I know right? It does.  Like a half a horse and a gargoyle or something.  As opposed to like a Passover dinner.  Yeah okay.   Okay so it was first discovered and identified in 1983. At the time it was estimated there were less than 100 butterflies left.  Wow!  And ...  This butterfly had a feature that just played right into my hands. They are like perfectly timed to an academic year.    He was like you know what? After I am done teaching for the year I will just drive down there a few days in the summer. Maybe it will take a summer or two. It sounds like a fun little puzzle.  So it was a no-brainer for me.  No big deal. He says yes.  I was confident that yeah I was gonna be the person to set it on the right path.  Totally.  I mean there was no question to me that I was the person who could oversee its recovery. I will say there I am a naive optimist.  Naive because it is almost 20 years later he is still trying to save this little flappy creature. He often loses sleep over it. And even though this little butterfly is about the size of a quarter this thing has entirely upturned his idea of life and death and creation. And destruction.   Okay.  2002 Nick goes to Fort Bragg. To start off he just needs to figure out like how many of these Saint Francis' satyr butterflies are there on Fort Bragg. So he and his students they basically like trace along 40 miles of creeks and streams.  And the first year we determined the population size to be about 1000 butterflies outside the artillery ranges.  Wow.  He is like Huh. Oh wow! This is like actually not as bad as I thought.  A thousand. I dunno. Does that seem like a lot or a few?  Pretty good.  Well it turns out it is just almost nothing. I mean if you rounded up a thousand butterflies and could just hold them in your hands you could smash them down to the size of I do not know a softball or something.  So not great. But he is like that is still more butterflies than the hundred that that original paper said that there were. This thing seems to be surviving on its own. Let us just wait see what happens come back next summer.  My approach to conservation was literally hands off.  So they come back the next year and count is slightly higher. They are like okay great. But then two years later things started going like really badly.  And then it was down and down from there.  And they find out that one kind of little thriving vibrant population they had it is gone. So they are like okay whatwhat just happened? And Nick does a little detective work and what he figures out is it is due to flooding.  Was flooded over by a beaver.  There are beavers at the base. Beavers build dams. Dams cause water to build up and then that water is enough to drown the caterpillars who are eating the grass-like sedges. So obviously no caterpillars no butterflies. So Nick pieces that together but pretty quickly another population goes down.  And that one was because of a catastrophic wildfire that just scorched everything.  These fires often get started because of the artillery range. And as you can imagine these little paper-thin wings of a butterfly do not do well with fire.  So here I was just keeping a hands-off approach to a butterfly's habitat and the butterfly started to decline.  So he is thinking Okay. So my hands-off approach did not work. We need to do something. Maybe I have to go in and protect it. And seems pretty clear the problems are flooding and fire. So let us just remove those problems.  So how does he get rid of those problems?  Well the fire is a bit harder to manage because it is more unpredictable. But the beavers he was like Yeah we need to do something about these beavers. There is truly only one person fit for the job.  In my office I became where I was kind of the beaver liaison for our office.  Brian Ball a biologist who works with the Army.  So like when there is any kind of beaver issues ...  He is your guy. So Brian brings out the big guns.  A beaver deceiver. Basically a pipe through the dam.    And a beaver deceiver iswhat they do is they take the dam and then they basically like just punch a hole and then put a pipe through the dam so that like the water is still going through but the beaver does not realize. So it is a beaver deceiver. But it did not always deceive the beaver.  And we destroyed the dam four or five times.  They would basically go in with their hands and just break up these dams. That did not always work.  So I put fences up I think four times.  Still the enemy would not give up. So in one case they actually evicted the beaver.  I guess you could put it that way yeah.  They would like take the beavers and they would like put them in the back of a truck and take them somewhere else. And then just be like Okay here's your new home. Once the beavers' suitcase of twigs were unpacked in the new home no more disturbances. Nick thought Okay now the butterflies will come back. But then ...  I called to get reports from my graduate students to get you know daily updates on were these butterflies in the places we would hoped? Were there abundances high enough to sustain the population? And the answer to both of those questions is no the butterflies just disappeared.  He cannot even tell why anymore.  Another population was lost. The next year another the next year another.  There are years where he goes out to places where butterflies were thriving the last time he was there and now he does not even see a single one.  It was very surreal.  I mean it was almost in an instant.  It was ait was mind-blowing how quick it happened.  So they went from in the early '80s a hundred butterflies to the early 2000s 1700 butterflies to now in 2011 75 butterflies.  What had we done wrong?  Nick himself is in really bad shape. Like the way he talks about it he feels guilty.  I mean it was frustrating it was humiliating. Here I am the conservation biologist the scientist thinking I am the one. I am the savior for this butterfly. And yet exactly the opposite is happening.  Like imagine you are inheriting a thing at its best and then you watch it and it slowly is slipping out of your fingers and then it gets to its worst it is ever been.  Yeah absolutely it weighs on you. If we mess this up you know this thing could disappear forever.  Well that is it for the butterfly.  It is like Oh if this now goes down it is me that is let planet Earth down on this.  This butterfly was going extinct on my watch.  So then what do you do?  So what I have not told you is that Nick had a sort of Hail Mary shot which is that back in the early '90s long before Nick actually got there some army people had seen these butterflies on an artillery testing range but that area was closed off to civilians. Nick had never been allowed access.  Why was it closed off to him?  These are very serious places. Like these are deadly places. At some points in the year bombs are going off 247. Like just to give you a sense like there was an explosion where soldiers multiple soldiers special ops soldiers three of them went to the hospital one of them died. And while Nick was working there they had had an incident where a civilian had snuck onto the base was trying to salvage like scrap metal from old bombs.  And blew himself up and died.  Oh my God!  Given that circumstance of course the military had to clamp down.  So very dangerous place. And he does not even know if the butterflies are still there. Like they were last seen decades ago. But Nick and his biologist colleagues feel like this is just crucial for the survival of the species so he is like I have to go find out. They beg the folks in charge of the base to let them onto the artillery range. And the powers that be agree.   Now the tape you are hearing Nick recorded it back in 2020.   And that first time he was allowed to go on the condition that he go with ...  Okay. So I call it sounds of freedom. You have the sounds of freedom going off 24 hours a day here.  ... Tracy Johnson.  My expertise in the military was you know ordnance.  They are called EODExplosive Ordnance Disposal.  What is ordnance?  Bombs hand grenades rockets. Pretty much anything that goes boom. That is how I was in a situation where I was able to meet Nick.  And so for the first time ...   Nick is allowed to enter the artillery range.  The first trip I remember it in detail. My eyes were wide open.   Lines of soldiers were pointing their guns. Soldiers are being parachuted out of planes onto landing fields.   The thing you really notice is the explosions.  Bomb areas continuously bombed or you know artillery.  Absolutely.  Constant detonation of ordnance.   They have to wait for a green light to tell them that live fire has ceased. So eventually green light turns on.  And I am like all right let us go.  We head out to look at what the butterfly's habitat looked like.  And they start walking.  They follow me because I got to go first and make sure that the path is clear that there is nothing dangerous that they are gonna step on.  First Tracy then Brian who is pointing the way. And then ...  I go in.  Nick. And he is sort ofin his head he is picturingwhat he told me he was picturing was this like pockmarked moonscape. Like you know the image they have in like every high school history textbook of like World War I trench warfare? Bombed out trees and like just dirt and mud and like holes in the ground like that kind of thing?  Yeah.  So that is what he is expecting.   I am just looking on the ground for things that I might step on that I should not be stepping on.  And there is definitely some of that.   I walked with ...    Trepidation.     But as they kept moving deeper and deeper into the range ...  We ended up in the swampy area.   It is going through just a dense thicket of shrubs and vines. I am getting scratched up by thorns and ...  You know the growth gets thicker in places.   There are more animals creeping around.  I seen the biggest snake I think I have ever seen in my life that day. Huge cottonmouth. A fat boy. Yeah he is big.  I have always been kind of a snake frog salamander type person. And so I am the one that is always looking for snakes.    And so we break through crash through the vines.   Nick says they came to these pockets where ...   Honestly my mouth was agape at that. It was so beautiful.  What?  It is a healthy wetland forest.   All kinds of flowers.  Hundreds of orchids.   There are all these birds.   Bobwhite quail.  Red-cockaded woodpecker.  It is like a symphony going on for sure.  It is a garden of Eden.  It really was. I mean it was ...   Incredible.  So he is walking through this area ...  My head's you know watching the ground and his head's up in the air you know looking for the butterflies.  And pretty quickly Tracy she goes ...  Oh wow! What do we have here?  Oh is that one of your butterflies?  This little brown butterfly sitting on the underside of a leaf.  And he is like Yeah. Yeah that is one of my butterflies.   Within a matter of seconds I saw a Saint Francis' satyr.   And then I walked on for you know a few more feet.   And there was another and another and another.  So there were 60 off the artillery range that he was like preciously protecting and like holding onto as the last gasp of the species. And in 15 minutes he just saw 50 of them.  There they were.  These things are thriving here. Like they are thriving!  I was exhilarated. I mean that is the only feeling I had is well exhilaration and relief. They appeared to be safe. Something that was happening inside the artillery ranges actually did a better job of managing habitats for the butterfly than whatever we were doing outside the artillery ranges.  Like why are they thriving here and not out there? What is different?  What caused that dynamic?  Like the butterflies are cheating on him or something. Like he is like What do they have that I do not? Like what was the artillery range giving to you that I was not? And what he starts to realize is basically that like everything he knows about the Saint Francis' satyr everything he knows about conservation everything he knows about life and death is wrong.  So first there is basically no people to muck with the ecosystem.  Fort Bragg has got a lot of areas that are not disturbed and have not been disturbed for hundreds of years you know thanks to the ranges. And that creates that little pocket of opportunities.  Because there is no people they leave beaver. So beavers they create dams.  Those dams they do flood they do drown those caterpillars but they also do other things.  Beaver abandon the dams. And it is behind those abandoned dams where sediments have accumulated that provide rich soil that then plants can grow into includingand especiallythe food for the butterfly. It is a big buffet.  But actually the even more surprising thing is when it comes to the bombs the butterflies were not surviving on the testing ranges despite the bombs they were surviving because of the bombs.  How is that possible? These are like the tiniest flimsiest little creatures in the world.  So the Saint Francis' satyr they live in an environment in North Carolina that helps plants grow quickly. And so these grassy wetlands are not grassy wetlands for long. Soon vines grow in then shrubs grow in then trees grow in. And those things well they out-compete the grasses.  So the explosions the gunfire ...  I understand machine guns are actually very good at setting fires.  And those fires kill butterflies but they also thin out the trees. So thinner trees means more sunshine. More sunshine and more space for grassy sedges to grow. More grassy sedges means more food for caterpillars. More food for caterpillars means more caterpillars means more butterflies.  Ordnance they do not create a less-natural world. They create a more natural world.  Wow! So the thing that he thought he needed to protect the butterflies from are actually the thing that is making them stronger.  Exactly.  And so this is where I had my biggest epiphany. Going into the artillery range what I realized is my perception of butterflies as fragile was totally misplaced.  And like this whole time he was exactly 180 degrees wrong. So he basically learns from this. He is like Okay. Let us fuckin' go! I do not love saying fucking but it justit does work here.  I basically went from no disturbance in our sites to all disturbance at our sites.  He and Brian they are like ...  Let us get in there with chainsaws. Let us tear up some stuff.  Cutting down trees.  Cut it up buck it on your shoulders and take it out.  And then they would build dams as if they were beavers.  Dam them up. Let us make a big mud hole. Let us dam up some streams and make sure we get some water on them.  And hey and while we are at it let us start some fires! Brian the biologist with the army was telling me he basically goes around on the back of an ATV with like a flamethrower.  Not that bad. Not that bad.  It isthere is a lot of science to it and there is a lot of art but there is apretty close to a flamethrower yeah.  And so we were able to create the wetlands that the butterflies needed.  After that they wait for a little bit.  It took us about two years to see the semblance of success.   I will usually give him a few before I start counting just to make him feel better.  Oh wow so it is a head start kind of thing.   Yeah I give him a head start. Yeah yeah. I am a giver.   After Nick started using those lessons to save the butterflies the population off of the ranges has rebounded from less than a hundred to over 3000.   So they are doing better than they have ever done before.  Wow!   Well when the butterflies start flying well that is exhilarating every time I see them.   What I realized in the end is that you have to kill some butterflies to save butterfly populations.  Saving and killing as these two discrete things that are opposites and separate from each other but they are just so weirdly marbled all up in each other.  And I hate saying that because when there is only 3000 butterflies left in the world how can you justify killing any butterflies? But with the next step of new habitat regenerating that will be good for the butterflies.  Better. That will actually create foster more than you are killing.  Yes exactly.   So this is weird to admit and I have never actually done this in a story before but that was supposed to be the ending. What you just heard? That was the story I pitched that was the story I reported that was the story I wanted to tell. But then as I was finishing the reporting I talked to somebody somebody integral to the Saint Francis satyr story who took Nick's lessonkilling in order to save life springing forth from deathand pushed it further. Took it to a whole new level. A level that left me shocked and that made Nick very uncomfortable. That is after the break.    Okay so now I want to do something sort of different.  Yeah go for it.  It is a little weird. I am gonna start the same story over but from a different point of view.  Okay.  June 2 1983. A sweltering ...  June 2 1983.  Yup. It is a sweltering day.  I was 10 years old. Not that this has anything to do with me so continue.   It was a sweltering day at Fort Bragg North Carolina. A 19-year-old soldier is tromping through the muddy wetland and he notices something. It is brown and it is about the size of a quarter and it is fluttering through the tall grass around him. And it is a butterfly.  Hmm.  Now this soldier his name is Thomas Kral he has been a butterfly collector since he was six years old and he knows enough about them to look at this one and say This is something different. And a few years later he actually ends up co-authoring a paper saying basically it is a new subspecies of butterfly. Very few left all on Fort Bragg. And because of that it says in the paper we need to protect this thing. And he also names it. So he calls it the Saint Francis' satyr after the patron saint of animals. Now that paper is the thing that Nick our guy from the first part based the last almost 20 years of his professional life on. It helps get the butterfly on the endangered species list and that is why the military ends up calling Nick. And then Nick gets involved and you know the rest of that story. But what we are gonna do right now is follow Tom's story.  Okay.  He leaves Fort Bragg and becomes a real-estate appraiser. So this is now we are in kind of the early '90s. Around this time US Fish and Wildlife raided Tom's house.  Whoa!  Oh before I forget these are the butterflies that we charged out on.  Oh those are really nice!  So I talked to the guy who was actually on that raid. His name is Chris Nagano.  I spent 27 years working on endangered species at the US Fish and Wildlife Service.  Okay great.  So ...  Turns out Tom was not just an enthusiast of butterflies he was an avid collector including collecting butterflies that you are not supposed to collect.  butterflies from protected sites listed butterflies.  So Chris and his team show up at Tom's house in TucSon Arizona.  When we got there his father was there. You know we said Fish and Wildlife here to execute a warrant. Is Tom here? And he said No he is out collecting.  So they start kind of going through his stuff.  He had chrysalids in his refrigerator.  Books and articles all over the bedroom. And about an hour into the search ...  He got home with the animals he had been collecting.  Oh my God! Oh wow.  And you know here were a bunch of federal ...  But after getting over the surprise of there being a bunch of federal agents in his house he agrees to walk them through his collection butterfly by butterfly.  You know and his collection rivaled major museums in the world.  He had a room full of cabinets and the cabinets were filled with butterflies. Almost 100000 specimens of butterflies including super rare ones.  I mean the guy was just a machine. You know I could point you know to a random butterfly any one of the thousands and Tom could go Oh yeah. I caught that on this trip and you know it was feeding on this kind of flower.  Like he was just very veryhe knew his collection very very well.  You know these guys theythey know a lot.  But there is one detail in all of this that really really stuck with me. So Tomthey did not just bust Tom they busted a bunch of other collectors too and in so doing they found letters that all of these collectors were sending to each other including Tom was sending talking about you know where to find the best butterflies and how to evade detection. And one of those letters from Tom the way he signed it was Yours in mass murder Tom.  Whoa! Yours in mass murder?  Yeah. I mean the guy who discovered this butterfly and wrote a paper saying like there is so few of them left we need to protect them also is signing letters saying Yours in mass murder and is involved in this like massive butterfly poaching ring. Like I felt like I just needed to talk to him.  Totally. Yeah.  And I was like trying to track him down. I could not find him could not find him could not find him ...   And then I found him.  Thomas Kral.  Hi Thomas. How you doing? Do you go by Thomas Tom?  Oh Tom is fine.  I should say really quickly that Tom he argued he was confuSed by laws. He did plead guilty in exchange for essentially a slap on the wrist. No jail time. But when I told him I was interested in talking about the Saint Francis' satyr which was not one of the butterflies he was charged for he was super game to talk.  This is a far larger story than I think you initially signed up for. And that is okay.  So I was like Okay let us do it!  Okay.  I was 19 years old and you know I started collecting butterflies on Fort Bragg.  So he told me the whole story about finding the butterfly.  These looked a little different. So that day I caught oh maybe about eight or so.  But when he got to the paper that he wrote about it ...  You know unfortunately looking back I was manipulated.  He actually claimed that the reviewers and the editors at that journal pushed him into saying things that he says were not true or at least leaving out you know key details.  This is important.  For example the paper says the butterfly is only on Fort Bragg. Tom says he saw them in other places too.  In a couple places I caught individuals off base of Fort Bragg.  And on top of that ...  I had caught hybrid or intermediate specimens between that and the Georgia satyr. And they left that out of the paper.  The way that it came across in the paper it is like Oh my God! It is about to die! But the way Tom puts it if it is mixing with other species ...  You know this is natural selection taking place.  It is not dying it is just assimilating into the family next door.  This butterfly really is not going extinct. It is going extinct in that form but its genetics you know that everybody seems to be concerned about continues on in another population.  So basically what Tom is saying is that the dwindling populations of this butterfly are just no big deal. Which for me as a reporter I was like he just pulled the rug out from the entire story I just did.  Did he convincingly pull out the rug or did he ...?  I mean honestly I was not sure. I mean I checked out the journal. Totally scientifically legit. I talked to the editor at the time. He remembered it. Said that there was nothing weird about the review or the editing. He still stands by it. And when it comes to the science you know the things Tom says he actually saw I figured I should just put it in front of Nick.  Have you even met him or talked to him before?  Never met him.  Okay.  So I just started out by telling him first of all Tom said he found Saint Francis' satyrs off the base.  Off of Fort Bragg.  Wow!  But he did not write about that.  That is new knowledge.  And at first Nick was like that would be so great.  That is critically important knowledge if he ...  Yep. He also said ...  ... found the he identified the place.  But then Tom was a bit vague about where exactly and then when he named a certain spot Nick was likeOh my team and I we already looked there.  He is off base. We are working on that right now.  And a whole bunch of other places nearby.  We have searched in the most likely places based on our best knowledge and the guidance that we can get from remote sensing or from experts in the area but ...  They had not found even a single one.  Never found it.  Okay another thing he said ...  So then I told him that Tom said that the Saint Francis' Satyr was just mixing with this other group.  Hybridizing with the Georgia satyr.  No. That is not happening.  In this case Nick was just like Nope. No way.  We have thought about that a lot.  We have actually studied the Georgia Satyr. We have tried to figure out if this is happening. But these two butterflies ...  They are different in how they look. They are different in how they behave.  They are different in their DNA.  And they are different in where they are on the landscape. You know there is some remote chance but no they do not hybridize.  So Nick had me back to okay if you look at the science if you look at the studies if you look at the evidence this thing is super rare. And it is not mixing with the neighbors. So it really is like if we do not save it it really is going to disappear. And I actually put all this back in front of Tom. Mixed reaction. And Tom was not convinced.  So you know how do we know what its true range is or if people find it?  Okay so did you believe at the time that this ought to have been an endangered species?  Absolutely not did I ever think this thing should have been listed as endangered. Absolutely not.  I mean I got the sense like a pretty clear sense that he sees conservation science as totally politicized. And I think you know there is a chunk of that that has to do with his past experience but there was also something that ran deeper than that I think. You know he was arguing that little subspecies of butterflies like the Saint Francis' satyr that are so small so marginal it just is not worth the effort to save it at that point.  There is not. I hate to say it but insectsnot in aggregate but as individual speciesthey are minor players. Picking one or two entities and saying these are endangered. It becomes ludicrous.  Sounds like a good way to justify collecting species to extinction and have a better collection.  Which is a fair point by Nick. But at the same time this was a question I was asking myself as I was learning about Nick's work you know nearly 20 years of tromping through bomb fields. And it is a question I have heard lots of people ask including some scientists. You know should we be picking out these little itty-bitty things that there is just a few left of and you know put a lot of resources into trying to save them?  Insects are vast. I mean just in terms of butterflies in North America there is over 700 kinds. There is several hundred different you know additional subspecies. And this just really becomes one of you know thousands of other types of butterflies.  Like from Tom's POV it is like If I had not discovered this thing in the first place you would not even care about it.  What I am saying is there is better places to put your limited conservation dollars.  This is an argument that Nick has to face all the time.  Honestly I struggle with this one because you canlike Saint Francis' satyr you cannot make the argument that they are pollinators or prey in their ecosystem that matter to anything. Saint Francis' satyr matters to zero flowers. Dragonflies and spiders eat Saint Francis' satyrs but they are so few of them like they could make a fraction of one individual dragonfly's diet.  It is not easy to come up with a practical or feel-good reason to save a creature like the Saint Francis' satyr. But especially as we are now in the middle of what scientists call the insect apocalypse which you know because of pollination and food chains and everything ripples out into a wider ecological disaster folks like Nick have to find like a little spot of territory to protect in that larger battle right? He has to answer like why should we care about this butterfly? And Nick he really just lands on a simple moral point.  What is caused them to decline is not some background rate of evolution it is people that have drained wetlands have put fields farm fields or houses on butterflyor next to butterfly habitat.  And it is like once we find out that it exists like to do nothing is to let it die.  The reason to protect them in the end is an ethical one. We people should not be the cause of extinction.  This is on us.  Yeah.           A quick note in the time since we started reporting this the number of Saint Francis' satyrs has gone back down a little bit. They are hovering around 800. So Nick still has a fight on his hands.    This story was reported by me Latif Nasser. Produced by Rachael Cusick. With music from Jeremy Bloom and mix help from Arianne Wack as usual.  And then there is more things you are gonna say right?  Yeah and special thanks to Snooki Puli Cita Escalano Jeffrey Glassberg Margot Williams Mark Romyn Elizabeth Long the Public Affairs and Endangered Species Branches at Fort Bragg.  Before we go I just want toI just want to say that coming up not now but in a week is a baller series from our producer Simon Adler starting next week.  So exciting!  And it is not about butterflies but it is about a thing you might have overlooked a piece of technology that no one thinks about but it actually determined everything about the world we live in from the internet to the little phone in your hand that is listening to my voice now. And Simon is going to take you literally around the world in story after story.  And through time.  Yes! Through time through space. And he wrote all the music for this thing and wrotejust like it was a true feat of one man doing everything and it is kind of mind-blowing. I know that we will disappoint you inevitably at some point at Radiolab but it will not happen in the next five weeks.    That I can assure you.    So ...  What awhat a promise. Do not unsubscribe yet.  Do not unsubscribe yet. That starts next week.  Okay we should go.  Okay.  Thanks for listening.  Bye. Copyright  2021 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved.
