     Testing one two. This is the headphones?   I am Jad.   I am Robert.   How is that? Better?   Oh much better.   This is Radiolab.   Can I interrupt?   Yes.   Could I say ...   Me first. Me first. Because if I let you go it is gonna be another 20 minutes until I get to talk.   A little while back I had a rather boisterous conversation with these two guys.   First of all like who are you?   I am Larry Ubell.   Yeah.   And I am Alvin Ubell.   So you are related and you are both in the plumbing business?   Are we related?   Yes we are related. But we are in the home inspection business.   Yeah.   They are father and son. It is a family business.   We are the principals of Accurate Building Inspectors of Brooklyn New York.   And I have been in the construction industry ever since I am about 16 years old. I am 84.   Okay.   I am not giving my age.    I wanted to talk to them because as building inspectors they -- there is something they see over and over and over.   Yup.   All the time.   That is actually a clue in what turns out to be a deep deep mystery.   Which -- which is what exactly?   Well let us say you have a yard in front of your house. Yours is back of your house but let us make it in the front.   Okay.   And right in the middle of the yard is a tree.   And the tree happens to be a weeping willow.   Just for example. And not too far away from this tree underground there is a water pipe.   A perfectly good pipe.   Connecting your house to the main city water line that is in the middle of the street. The roots of this tree of course can go any way they want to go. They can go north south east west whatever. But the Ubells have noticed that even if a tree is 10 or 20 30 yards away from the water pipe for some reason the tree roots creep with uncanny regularity straight toward the water pipe.   The tree will wrap its roots around that pipe.   Around and around and around.   In a tangling of spaghetti-like almost a -- and each one of those lines of spaghetti is squeezing a little bit. Each one an ounce an ounce an ounce an ounce an ounce. Eventually over a period of time it will crack the pipe like a nutcracker.   Yes.   The Ubells see this happening all the time.   Yeah and I have done inspections where roots were coming up through the pipe into the house.   Into the house?   It is amazing.   Yes.   This -- this actually happened to me. The magnolia tree outside of our house got into the sewer pipes reached its tentacles into our house and busted the sewage pipe.   This happens to a lot of people. It is almost as if these plants -- it is almost as if they know where our pipes are.   I see what is happening.   What?   Are you bringing the plant parade again? Is that what -- is that what this?   Well of course I am.   You are doing the -- like okay first it was the roots under the ground all connected into a whole hive thing.   I do not know why you have problems with this.   No it is because it is like every time I close my eyes you are coming at it from a different direction.   I do! I do!   With the plant parade.   And I met a plant biologist who is gonna lead that parade. She is done three experiments and I think if I tell you about what she has done you -- even you -- will be provoked into thinking that plants can do stuff you did not imagine dream they could do.   Hmm.   I know -- I know you -- I know you do not. But let me just -- let me give it a try.   Okay. I am game.   So let us go to the first. This is the plant and pipe mystery.   Hello finally!   Hello! Hello at long last.   Now you might think that the plant sends out roots in every direction. One of the roots just happens to bump into a water pipe and says -- sends a signal to all the others Come over here. Here's the water.   Right.   But that scientist I mentioned ...   My name is Monica Gagliano. I am a research associate professor at the University of Sydney.   She took that notion out of the garden into her laboratory.   Yeah tested it in my lab.   She took some plants put them in a pot that restricted the roots so they could only go in one of just two directions toward the water pipe or away from the water pipe.   What kind of pot is this?   It is kind of -- it is shaped like ...   Like the letter Y but upside down.   So the roots can go either left or to the right.   Oh.   Now the plants if they were truly dumb they would go 5050. It would be all random.   Right.   But after five days she found that 80 of the time the plants went -- or maybe chose -- to head toward the dry pipe that has water in it. So the question is ...   A plant that is quite far away from the actual pipe how does it know which way to turn and grow its roots so that it can find the water?   All right my hypothesis is that what happens is ...   No I ...   Can I -- can I have a few minutes?   No.   You got somewhere to go? You got somewhere to go?   No.   Good. If she is going to do this experiment most likely she is going to use cold water. She is not gonna use hot water because you do not want to cook your plants you know? And it is more expensive. Why waste hot water?   By the way should we establish -- is it a fact that you are ...   No no.   You want to contest?   He is on the right track. You have to understand that the cold water pipe causes even a small amount of water to condense on the pipe itself. On the outside of the pipe.   It is kind of like a cold glass sitting on your desk and there is always a puddle at the bottom.   The glass is not broken. There is not a leak in the glass.   It is not leaking. The water is still in there.   So there is some water outside of the pipe. It is condensation.   Right.   So what they are saying is even if she is totally sealed the pipe so there is no leak at all the difference in temperature will create some condensation on the outside. And it is that little little bit of moisture that the plant will somehow sense.   If you look at a root under a microscope what you see is all these thousands of feelers like hairs on your head looking for water. Every one of them. And all of a sudden one of them says Oh oh oh oh! I found a little water! And then all the other ones go in the same direction.   These sensitive hairs he argues would probably be able to feel that tiny difference.   Yes.   But Monica says ...   No.   Absolutely not.   I purposely removed the chance for a moisture gradient.   She made sure that the dirt did not get wet because she would actually fastened the water pipe to the outside of the pot. So it was not touching the dirt at all.   Wait. So the -- this branching pot thing.   Uh-huh.   The part where the water pipe was the pipe was on the outside of the pot?   That is right. Outside.   And the plant still went to the place where the pipe was not even in the dirt?   Yeah.   That is strange.   Or it is just the vibration of the pipe that is making it go toward it.   They would have to have some ...   Maybe there is some kind of signal? Different kind of signal traveling through the soil? Monica thought about that and designed a different experiment.   Again if you imagine that the pot my experimental pot.   With the forked bottom.   Yeah. But then have ...   Two very different options for our plant. On one side instead of the pipe with water she attaches an MP3 player with a little speaker playing a recording of ...   The sound of water.   And then on the other side Monica has another MP3 player with a speaker. But this one plays ...   Nothing.   So she is got her plants in the pot and we are going to now wait to see what happens. Remember that the roots of these plants can either go one direction towards the sound of water in a pipe or the other direction to the sound of silence. On the fifth day they take a look and discover most of the roots a majority of the roots were heading toward the sound of water.   Exactly. Exactly.   So they just went right for the MP3 fake water not even the actual water? Just the sound of it?   Just the sound.   That -- that is -- that is interesting.   That is interesting.   That is interesting.   But what -- how would a plant hear something? Like they do not have ears or a brain or anything like they could not hear like we hear.   Well maybe. They definitely do not have a brain. No question there. But they do have root hairs.   This is Jennifer Frazer.   I am the blogger of The Artful Amoeba at Scientific American.   And she was willing to entertain the possibility that plants can do something like hear.   So what do we have in our ears that we use to hear sound?   Little hairs!   Little hairs.   Yes!   Right? And if you go to too many rock concerts you can break these hairs and that leads to permanent hearing loss which is bad. So maybe the root hairs which are always found right at the growing tips of plant roots maybe plant roots are like little ears. Maybe each root is -- is like a little ear for the plant. I do not know.   That is cool. That is definitely cool.   Okay.   The thing I do not get is in animals the hairs in our ear are sending the signals to a brain and that is what chooses what to do.   That is true.   If a plant does not have a brain what is choosing where to go?   I do not think Monica knows the answer to that but she does believe that you know that we humans ...   We are a little obsessed with the brain. And so we are under the impression or I would say the conviction that the brain is the center of the universe and -- and if you have a brain and a nervous system you are good and you can do amazing stuff. And if you do not have one by default you cannot do much in general.   Okay.   It is a very biased view that humans have in particular towards others.   But still. I mean to say that a plant is choosing a direction I do not know. I mean it is -- like when a plant bends toward sunlight.   Mm-hmm.   We have all seen houseplants do that right?   Right.   Would you say that the plant is seeing the sun? No. I mean it is just -- it is reacting to things and there is a series of mechanical behaviors inside the plant that are just bending it in the direction. I mean could not it just be like that?   I think that is fair. I think if I move on to the next experiment from Monica you are going to find it a little bit harder to object to it. We need to take a break first but when we come back the parade that I want you to join will come and swoop you up and carry you along in a flow of enthusiasm.     Three two one Jad.   Robert.   Radiolab.   Yep.   So today we have a triptych of experiments about plants.   Mm-hmm.   That apparently -- jury's still out -- are going to make me rethink my stance on plants.   Yes.   So we are up to experiment two now are we not?   That is correct. So we are going to meet a beautiful little plant called a mimosa pudica which is a perfectly symmetrical plant with leaves on either side of a central stem.   Yeah mimosa has been one of the pet plants I guess for many scientists for like centuries.   Because this peculiar plant has a -- has a surprising little skill.   Yeah. A reflex.   An anti-predator reaction?   Like a defensive mechanism.   As soon as it senses that a grazing animal is nearby ...   If a nosy deer happens to bump into it the mimosa plant ...   Folds its leaves.   Curls all its leaves up against its stem.   The whole thing immediately closes up and makes it look like Oh there is no plant here. Just a boring set of twigs. Nothing delicious at all.   So the deer's like Oh well. Never mind.   Right.   And you can actually see this happen. So you can get -- anybody can get one of these plants and we did. And if you just touch it ...   Can I try it?   Yeah go for it.   ... even just one leaf.   Like that?   You can actually watch this cascade ...   Ah! Whoa!   Where all the leaves close in like do do do do do do.   Look at that. They all went closed.   It is sort of startling to see.   That is so eerie.   So that voice belongs to Aatish Bhatia who is with Princeton University's Council on Science and Technology. We showed one of these plants to him and to a couple of his colleagues Sharon De La Cruz ...   This guy or this guy?   And Peter Landgren.   Oh that is neat!   Because we wanted them to help us recreate Monica's next experiment.   Okay.   So maybe could you just describe it just briefly just what you did?   Well I created these horrible contraptions.   Apparently she built some sort of apparatus. I guess you could call it a mimosa plant drop box.   Picture one of those parachute drops that they have at the -- at state fairs or amusement parks where you are hoisted up to the top. Except in this case instead of a chair they have got a little plant-sized box.   Into which she put these sensitive plants.   So the plants are now you know buckled in minding their own business. And then Monica would ...   Drop them.   Just about you know seven or eight inches.   Landing very comfortably onto a padded base made of foam. So no plants were actually hurt in this experiment.      But the drop was just shocking and sudden enough for the little plant to ...   Close all its leaves.   Do its reflex defense thing. Then Monica hoists the plant back up again and drops it again. And again. And again. And after not a whole lot of drops the plant she noticed stopped closing its leaves.   So after the first few the plants already realized that that was not necessary.   The plants -- the plants stopped -- what is it they did?   They stopped folding up. She thinks that they somehow remembered all those drops and it never hurt so they did not fold up any more. They learned something.   Exactly which is pretty amazing.   Could not it just be an entirely different interpretation here?   Like what?   The plants have to keep pulling their leaves up and they just get tired. They run out of energy.   Yeah it might run out of fuel. Exactly. It is a costly process for this plant but ...   She figured out they were not tired. Because after dropping them 60 times she then shook them left to right and they instantly folded up again.   It would close up.   Oh!   So it is not that it could not fold up it is just that during the dropping it learned that it did not need to.   Yeah.   That is a -- learning is something I did not think plants could do.   They do.   So we figured look if it is this easy and this matter of fact we should be able to do this ourselves and see it for ourselves. So that is where these -- the scientists from Princeton come in Peter Sharon and Aatish. They designed from scratch a towering parachute drop in blue translucent Lego pieces.   So this is our plant dropper. And we can move it up and we can drop it.   So we strapped in our mimosa plant.   Little seatbelt for him for the ride down.   And then ...   All right. And then someone has to count.   I will count.   And then we let it drop.   Five four three two one drop! Five four three two one drop!   And we dropped it once and twice. Again. And again. We were waiting for the leaves to you know stop folding. We dropped. We dropped. But it did not happen.   It was curling each time when it ...   Every time. It just kept curling and curling. It did not seem to be learning anything.   So you could not replicate what she saw.   Nothing happened at all. So we went back to Monica.   Yeah.   We as you know built your elevator.   I heard.    We told her what we did.   What happened to you did not happen to us. Now can you -- can you imagine what we did wrong?   Like for example my plants were all in environment-controlled rooms which is not a minor detail. They are not experiencing extra changes for example. I do not know if that was the case for your plants.   No I -- we kept switching rooms because we were not sure whether you want it to be in the high light or weak light or some light or no light.   I wonder if that was maybe a bit too much. Was it possible that maybe the plants correctly responded by not opening because something really mad was happening around it and it is like This place is not safe.   Truth is I think on this point she is got a -- she is right. One time the plant literally flew out of the pot and upended with roots exposed.   This feels one of those experiments where you just abort it on humanitarian grounds you know?   So I think what she would argue is that we kind of proved her point. We were so inconsistent so clumsy that the plants were smart to keep playing it safe and closing themselves up.   So actually I think you were very successful with your experiment. You found exactly what the plants would do under your circumstances which were I do not know let us say a bit more tumultuous than mine.   And she goes on to argue that had we been a little bit more steady and a little bit more consistent the plants would have learned and would have remembered the lesson. Because what she does next is three days later she takes these plants back into the lab.   The idea was to drop them again just to see like the difference between the first time you learn something and the next time.   Like would they figure it out faster this time? Or maybe slower?   Yeah.   So she takes the plants she puts them into the parachute drop she drops them. And she says this time they relaxed almost immediately.   Yeah. They would remember straight away.   Straight away.   All of them know already what to do.   They remembered what had happened three days before that dropping did not hurt that they did not have to fold up. So they did not.   Yeah.   And then she waited a few more days and came back. They still remembered.   Yeah.   Few more days.   Yeah. And it was almost like let us see how much I have to stretch it here before you forget.   Eventually she came back after ...   28 days.   28 days!   Yes.   And they still remembered. They still did not close when she dropped them. That is what she says.   What was your reaction when you saw this happen?   That is producer Annie McEwen.   This retention of knowledge?   My reaction was like Oh ! That was my reaction. Because the only reason why the experiment turned out to be 28 days is because I ran out of time. So they might remember even for a much longer time than 28 days.   So she is saying they remembered for almost a month?   Yeah. I mean can you remember what you were doing a month ago?   No I actually like even this morning it is already like poof! Gone.   Exactly. Like that is a thing.   But supposing that she is right.   Yeah.   Where would the -- a little plant even store a memory?   Well that is what I asked her.   I do want to go back though to -- for something like learning like I do not understand -- learning as far as I understand it is something that involves memory and storage. And I do that in my brain. That is the place where I remember things. In my brain.   Or do you?   Yes I do!   Do you?   Is a brain -- I think.     Is your dog objecting to my analysis? That is okay.   Picasso! Pics! Picasso! Enough of that! Pics! Hey it is okay. It is okay puppy. It is okay.       Picasso enough of that now. Sorry!   Actually Monica's dog leads perfectly into her third experiment which again will be with a plant. But it was originally done with -- with a dog.   So Pavlov started by getting some dogs and some meat and a bell.   Science writer Jen Frazer gave us kind of the standard story.   And his idea was to see if he could condition these dogs to associate that food would be coming from the sound of a bell. So he brought them some meat.   They would salivate and then eat the meat.   Then he would bring them the meat and he would ring a bell.   And again drooling eating.   And he would repeat this.   Ring meat eat. Ring meat eat. Ring meat eat.   Finally one time he did not bring the meat but he rang the bell.     Sure enough ...   The dogs began to drool.   They had learned to associate the sound of the bell ...   Which has you know for dogs has nothing to do with meat.   With when they actually saw and smelled and ate meat.   Exactly.   Now that is a very you know animals do this experiment but it got Monica thinking.   Would the plant do the same?   Could a plant learn to associate something totally random like a bell with something it wanted like food?   Yeah.   Are you like aggressively looking around for -- like do you wake up in the morning saying Now what can I get a plant to do that reminds me of my dog or reminds me of a bear or reminds me of a bee?   Not really. No I guess that I feel kind of good to say this. It is like no no I do not do that.   But Monica says what she does do is move around the world with a general feeling of ...   Huh.   What if? So she decided to conduct her experiment.   Pretty much like the concept of Pavlov with his dog applied.   But instead of dogs she had pea plants in a dark room.   Yeah.   And for the meat substitute she gave each plant little bit of food. In this case a little blue LED light.   Light is obviously representing dinner.   So light is -- if you shine light on a plant you are like feeding it?   Yeah plants really like light you know? They need light to grow. So otherwise they cannot photosynthesize.   So for three days three times a day she would shine these little blue lights on the plants.   From a particular direction.   And she noticed that ...   Unsurprisingly ...   The plants would always grow towards the light.   Anyone who is ever had a plant in a window knows that.   And the salivation equivalent was the tilt of the plant?   Exactly. And then I needed to -- the difficulty I guess of the experiment was to find something that will be quite irrelevant and really meant nothing to the plant to start with. Like the bell for the dog.   So after much trial and error with click and hums and buzzes ...   All sorts of randomness.   She found that the one stimulus that would be perfect was ...   A fan.   A little fan. The same one that are used in computers like you know really tiny.   She determined that you can pick a little computer fan and blow it on a pea plant for pretty much ever and the pea plant would be utterly indifferent to the whole thing.   The plants did not care.   Then she placed the fan right next to the light so that ...   The light and the fan were always coming from the same direction.   And with these two stimuli she put the plants the little pea plants through a kind of training regime. Little fan goes on little light goes on both aiming at the pea plant from the same direction. And the pea plant leans toward them. Then she takes the little light and the little fan and moves them to the other side of the plant. Turns the fan on turns the light on and the plant turns and leans that way.   Yeah. Fan first light after. And moved around but always matched in the same way together.   Fan light lean. Fan light lean. Fan light lean. Same as the Pavlov. The bell the meat and the salivation.   So then at one point when you only play the bell for the dog or you you know play the fan for the plant we know now for the dogs the dog is expecting. So it is predicting something to arrive.   And Monica wondered in the plant's case ...   If there was only the fan would the plant ...   Anticipate the light and lean toward it?   Or would just be going random?   After three days of this training regime it is now time to test the plants with just the fan no light. So Monica moves the fans to a new place one more time. They are switched on. And the pea plants are left alone to sit in this quiet dark room feeling the breeze.   And then ...   The next day ...   I remember going in at the uni on a Sunday afternoon.   And she goes into that darkened room with all the pea plants.   So you know I am in the dark.   But she is got a little red headlamp on.   Yeah.   And she moves about the room.   To have a look ...   Peering down at the plants under the red glow of her headlamp.   And then I saw ...   That these little plants ...   My little peas ...   Had indeed turned and moved toward the fan stretching up their little leaves as if they were sure that at any moment now light would arrive.   And it is good it was Sunday. And I remember it was Sunday because I started screaming in my lab. It was like Oh I might disturb my plants! I go out and I thought there is no one here on Sunday afternoon. I can scream my head off if I want to. And so I was really excited. I was like Oh my God! These guys are actually doing it. And so of course that was only the beginning. Then we actually had to run four months of trials to make sure that you know that what we were seeing was not one pea doing it or two peas but it was actually a majority.   So you just did what Pavlov did to a plant. You got the plant to associate the fan with food.   Yep. Pretty much.   But once again I kind of wondered if -- since the plant does not have a brain or even neurons to connect the idea of light and wind or whatever where would they put that information? Like how can a plant -- how does a plant do that?   I do not know. I do not know yet. But what I do know is that the fact that the plant does not have a brain does not -- does not a priori say that the plants cannot do something. The fact that humans do it in a particular way it does not mean that everyone needs to do it in that way to be able to do it in the first place. There are multiple ways of doing one thing right?   Huh. So we are really -- like this is -- we are really at the very beginning of this.   Yeah I know. This way there is often more questions than answers but that is part of the fun as well.   Monica's work has actually gotten quite a bit of attention from other plant biologists.   Yes.   And some of them this is Lincoln Taiz ...   I am a professor emeritus of plant biology at UC Santa Cruz.   ... say they are very curious but want to see these experiments repeated.   It is a very interesting experiment and I really want to see whether it is correct or not.   Us too!   He is got lots of questions about her research methods but really his major complaint is -- is her language. Her use of metaphor.   Right.   For example words like ...   Hearing.   Or ...   Learning behavior.   And this? He is not a huge fan of.   Yes. If you get too wrapped up in your poetic metaphor you are very likely to be misled and to over-interpret the data. I mean it is a kind of romanticism I think. You know it goes back to anthropomorphizing plant behaviors.   Mm-hmm.   But I wonder if her using these metaphors ...   Again producer Annie McEwen.   ... is perhaps a very creative way of looking at -- looking at a plant and therefore leads her to make -- make up these experiments that those who would not think the way she would would ever make up. And therefore she might in the end see something that no one else would see. Is it ...   This is like metaphor is letting in the light as opposed to shutting down the blinds.   Yeah. Kind of even like could there be a brain or could there be ears or you know just sort of like going off the deep end there. But maybe it makes her sort of more open-minded than -- than someone who is just looking at a notebook.   I think you can be open-minded but still objective. I mean I think there is something to that. I think there are some cases where romanticizing something could possibly lead you to some interesting results.   So you are like a metaphor cop with a melty heart.   Yes.   That -- that would be an interesting ...   Do not interrupt. They have to -- have to edit in this together. Let him talk.   Yeah.   How much longer? Because I have an appointment.   All right that is it I think. Well I have one thing just out of curiosity ...   As we were winding up with our home inspectors Alvin and Larry Ubell we thought maybe we should run this metaphor idea by them.   There is -- on the science side there is a real suspicion of anything that is anthropomorphizing a plant. They just do not like to hear words like mind or hear or see or taste for a plant because it is too animal and too human.   Mm-hmm.   And the classic case of this is if you go back a few centuries ago someone noticed that plants have sex.   Oh yes.   That there was a kind of a moral objection to thinking it this way. And I am wondering whether Monica is gonna run into as she tries to make plants more animal-like whether she is just gonna run into this malice from the scientific -- I am just wondering do you share any of that?   No I do not because she may come up against it people who think that intelligence is unique to humans. And so I do not have a problem with that. I have been looking around lately and I know that intelligence is not unique to humans. Okay? So I do not have an issue with that. And every day that goes by I have less of an issue from the day before. So I do not have a problem. The problem is is with plants. They may have this intelligence maybe we are just not smart enough yet to figure it out.   Well okay. That is a parade I will show up for.   Okay. let us do it! Big thanks to Aatish Bhatia to Sharon De La Cruz and to Peter Landgren at Princeton University's Council on Science and Technology. Also thanks to Christy Melville and to Emerald O'Brien and to Andres O'Hara and to Summer Rayne.   You are thanking summer rain?   I am.   Did the plants sneak that one in?   No. No Summer is a real person and her last name happens to be spelled R-A-Y-N-E.   I see.   This story was nurtured and fed and ultimately produced by Annie McEwen. She actually trained this story in a rather elaborate experimental setup to move away from the light and toward a light breeze against all of its instincts. Oh one more thing. Thanks to Jennifer Frazer who helped us make sense of all this. You should definitely go out and check out her blog The Artful Amoeba especially to the posts the forlorn ones about plants.   Plants are really underrated.  When I write a blog post my posts that get the least traffic guaranteed are the plant posts. No matter how amazing I think that the results are for some reason people just do not think plants are interesting. And to me here are three more reasons that you can say No really! Plants are amazing and this world is amazing and that living creatures have this ability for reasons we do not understand cannot comprehend yet. That is amazing and fantastic. And does it change my place in the world? Does it threaten my sense of myself or my place as a human that a plant can do this? No. Does it threaten your sense of humanity that you depend for pretty much every single calorie you eat on a plant? No.   So you think that that this -- you think this is a hubris corrector?   Yeah. I mean what? So they cannot move. Well some of them can first of all and big deal. Can you make your own food? No.                                                -30-
