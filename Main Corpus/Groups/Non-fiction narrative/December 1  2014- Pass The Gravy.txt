 OK so this is how it went down - one thing I like to do around this time of year is just compose a list a simple list of things I am grateful for. So I sit down to write about how thankful I am for this beautiful ride or die woman who is on a journey with me thankful for these goofy kids we get to raise for my health or peaches for heat clothes. I am thankful for the time I got to spend with my brother. I am thankful for a beautiful Oakland California thankful for friends that I can call and ask for a kidney thankful for art for sight for work for love for family for magic for music for story. I am thankful for public schools. I am thankful we might get a dog and I am putting all this on paper and I start getting emotional. All right because truthfully before I started writing my mind had wandered to a dark place concentrating on things that were not right things that could go wrong things that somebody said. And I looked down at my paper and I start to laugh because honestly I have more than I could ever wrap my arms around. And I am so thankful that I got to write this list. So today on Snap Judgment it 'tis the season - from PRX and NPR we proudly present Gratitude amazing stories of Thanksgiving. My name is Glynn Washington. Let somebody know that you are happy to see them because this is SNAP JUDGMENT - Gratitude.
