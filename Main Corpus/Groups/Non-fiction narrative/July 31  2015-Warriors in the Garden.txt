Probably the strangest thing about the KR business-- KR that is Kidnap and Ransom-- is that it is a business at all that there are enough kidnappings in the world that a whole industry issues kidnap insurance and there is responders who will help your family through the kidnapping and ransom process. And it is also workaday like any other business. My name is Daniel Johnson. I oversee Kidnap Response operations for a company called ASI Global. We do a lot of prevention work which is training of Americans or executives. ASI Global is one of the big American companies in the KR business. And perhaps this just comes with the job but Daniel Johnson is capable of a kind of understatement that is sort of breathtaking. For instance he was telling me how KR insurance works. So if you were to have a Kidnap Response policy with traveler's insurance and something goes bump in the night it is our company that gets that call. By bump in the night Dan means what you or I might call a violent life-threatening life-changing abduction. See? Understatement. Another interesting fact about kidnapping insurance with this company-- one condition of having the policy is that you do not tell anybody you have the policy. It is like the first rule of Fight Club. OK so let us say that I am thinking about moving my radio show to a country where there are lots of kidnappings. You consult with people who are moving to those areas about what to do if you are kidnapped. If I am kidnapped give me advice. What should I do? Well most of the advice is going to be somewhat region or geographic specific. Some of the steps that we would recommend for Mexico are obviously not the same steps you would recommend for the Middle East or even Nigeria. Because of the Catholic culture in Mexico we do recommend that the victims personalize themselves. Ask for a Bible. In the Mideast he says do not do this or talk about religion. But in Mexico where there are lots of kidnappings these days-- It helps personalize you as some-- it is a basis of relation between you and the abductors. And it is to my advantage if they see me as a person why? Contrary to popular belief and some of the myths kidnappers in most cases do not wantonly with no reason whatsoever go in and abuse the victims. Unfortunately it does happen in some instances. Well the more personal you are to them the more that they can relate to you the less likely that is going to happen the better care that they are going to give. The other advantage of a Bible Dan says is that you might be captive for a long time. And one of the big problems in that situation is it is really really boring. People get depressed. They stop taking care of themselves. Some of them think about suicide. So it is important to keep your mind active to create a routine of things that you do every day not to sleep all day which lots of people end up doing. And if you have a Bible you can read which is huge. Other tips-- eat what they give you because it is probably the same food that they are eating. Drink the water. Do not try to escape. Do not look your captors in the eye. Sometimes it is viewed as being confrontational with the captors. And you want to be somewhat non-confrontational. Are there counterintuitive things that you tell people to do? Yes. Some of the recommendations we give are counterintuitive. For example most kidnap victims-- or not most but many kidnap victims when they are first captured feel that their life is in danger so they need to negotiate for themselves. So what they start to do is they start talking about my company made 10 million last year and I am a senior manager with my company. And my wife has a half million dollars in a 401K. That does not help the negotiation process. That raises the expectations of the kidnappers so what we typically recommend is you do not have financial conversations at all with your captors. But that is hard to do he says. Your instinct is that you want to trade away everything just to get your life back. You will do anything. But you have to understand if it is a kidnapping for ransom-- and one sign of that is that you are still alive-- that is like a business deal and they need you alive to make their money. And usually Dan says you are going to get out. It is just a matter of coming to a price. You have to remember that. And you have to remember that your role in that business deal is to be the hostage to do what you need to do to survive to avoid panic. Well from WBEZ Chicago it is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Today on our radio show Held Hostage. We have three stories for you of people who are forced by circumstance to be the hostage and how they cope with what that means. We are going to begin with people held in the traditional way nabbed and taken to the jungle. But we also have people in our show who are taken hostage in much less literal ways. One man cannot get out from under the thumb of one of his neighbors. And we have a man held hostage by love and I know that sounds really corny but believe me it is not what you think. Stay with us.  Act One Captive Audience. So today's episode is a rerun from 2010. And at that time nearly a decade ago there was so much kidnapping going on in Colombia that the country's biggest radio station had a program that was specifically for kidnapping victims. Like it was targeted to them as an audience. And this was not the only show like this. There were several other shows like this on smaller stations again whose audience was kidnapping victims around the country. Annie Correal is originally from Bogota Colombia. And she went to the biggest radio station and visited the program. The show is called Voces del Secuestro-- Voices of Kidnapping-- and it is been on the big national station in Colombia Caracol since 1994.   Starting at midnight every Saturday and running until 600 AM hundreds of people call in to send messages to their kidnapped relatives. And in secret camps all through the jungle prisoners and sometimes even their guards tune in to listen.   The host kicks off the show welcoming all the hostages in the jungles of Colombia. Most families call in with their messages.         But some people actually come into the station like Viviana. Her dad Edgar Yasid Duarte is a police commander who was kidnapped in 1998 and still has not come home.   Tomorrow is Viviana's 13th birthday and rather than run the risk of not getting on the air she and her mom are spending the night at the radio station. A dozen interns man flashing phone banks lining up the callers from around the country who will send out their messages tonight.   170 will make it on the air.   Viviana is in a pink hoodie drinking little cups of coffee from the vending machine to stay awake. She always sends a message to mark her birthday. It is 500 in the morning when she finally gets on the air.   She says her birthday's an important day in their lives and she just knows he is going to be there that they are going to free him this year so he will not miss any more special dates. She says she celebrated with her friends by going to a shopping mall and to the movies and to get ice cream. She tells him she loves him and she sends him a blessing. I know how she feels. When I was 19 my dad was kidnapped by the FARC the same rebel group that kidnapped Viviana's dad. The FARC is an army of leftist guerrillas that kidnaps people for political reasons but also civilians like my dad for money. My dad Jaime Correal was kidnapped on his way home from work in 1999. There was a guy on a motorcycle back there. But I did not think anything of it. I did not notice I was being followed. This year when I went back to Colombia my dad and I drove through a park up a winding isolated road to the spot on the highway where it happened. And right where I am standing the guy came from behind that pole and he came with a gun up was screaming Police police. I tried to get into the traffic and I could not get in because it was bumper to bumper. And that is when they hit the window and they pulled me out and they threw me in the backseat with two guys with a weapon. Back then Colombia was the kidnapping capital of the world. At the peak of the kidnapping craze there were around 3000 people kidnapped a year. That is like eight people a day. Carjackings happen in Bogota all the time and in plain view like my dad's. You know I had in my mind that it was not so close to the road but it is right there. Is that the first time you have been back to that spot? Uh-huh. Yep. As we sat in the spot where it happened he said if he had taken a left it would have taken him 20 minutes to get home. Instead it took me eight and a half months 265 days. While my dad was kidnapped I was in college in the States. But my stepmom Sammy used to call into the radio show Voices of Kidnapping to try to reach him. Six months in when the guerrillas arranged a phone call with my dad she learned to her amazement that some of our messages actually got through. My dad had had a radio and had listened for us obsessively. It was a black machine. I do not know. It was not a brand name that everybody knows. It was something like cauliflower OK? I mean it was as valuable as my cigarettes OK? And something I would wrap really well with my clothes in a plastic bag so they would not get wet. And reception was very bad. We were in the deep jungle so we learned from the guerrillas how to make antennas. We would steal the Brillo pad the used ones when we went by the kitchen. The Brillo pad you untangle it and you make a big line of wire. You get a stone wrap it up in one of the ends and you throw it up into the trees. That helped tremendously. A guard snuck the radio to my dad. They are not officially allowed but the FARC lets prisoners listen because it keeps up morale. It keeps them from killing themselves and it keeps them marching. My dad was moved 37 times during his captivity. The radio meant everything to him because for the first six months that he was held captive by the FARC my dad was held alone completely alone. The radio was his only companion. It is really an exercise of patience to be awake for 12 hours 13 hours and not being able to do anything. You can do anything. Sometimes you see all those movies. Like Rambo just exercises when he is in jail. And you say well I am going to start exercising and you exercise but you get bored. You start getting in shape let me tell you. But mentally you feel you are wasting your time. I was by myself between November that I was kidnapped until May 26. I could talk to the guards very little. They are not supposed to talk to you. But then at night then you rewind your whole life. How was that? That was scary. Because you start judging yourself. Mostly what comes to mind is what you think you did wrong-- wrong decisions that could have made a difference in your life. But it is being alone with all those ghosts. So when he first heard my stepmom Sammy talking to him over the radio it was like a miracle. You know it was like 620 in the morning. I was laying in bed with my radio. It said This is a message for Jaime Correal. I mean my heart stopped. I said Wow. She said Your kids are fine. Hold up. Pray. You know all the encouraging words they can give you. So from now on that was my lifeline. My dad would stay up all night listening to the show every week. A lot of times you lose to the station because actually you are always deep in the jungle and there is a lot of clouds. And then you just go very softly trying to locate it again. And then you do not want to move the radio so you end up in these awkward positions and just listening. When they call your name when they mention your name your heart always pounds.   This is a radio message from my family recorded 10 years ago when my dad was held captive. My stepmom made this tape to send to the radio station hoping he would hear it wherever he was. In real life she was struggling to hold it together losing weight dark circles under her eyes. But on the tape she makes a point to be cheerful. She calls him by his nickname Lumpy. My Lumpy    She chose one of her favorite love songs to mix with the radio message.   She says every time she hears it she thinks of him intensely. She asks if he can imagine how much they are going to enjoy making up for lost time. Then she introduces my little sister.   My little sister says she hopes he comes back soon safe and sound and that he will be very very very hungry because they will have his favorite-- eggs and sausage-- waiting for him. Then my brother comes on.   He says he is the goalie on the school soccer team and he is blocked a lot of shots. Then he says he loves him and misses him. My stepmom says that she is waiting for him that she will always wait for him and he is the love of her life. And she cannot wait to pick up where they left off in November. I love you.   Ciao ciao!   The families on Voices of Kidnapping are coached not to say anything negative or cry so there tends to be a lot of talk of holiday parties and kids' grades at school weddings new babies in the family. These days the number of new kidnappings in Colombia is way down. There are just a few hundred a year. And that is a good thing. But it conceals something basic. The fact is that thousands of people who are kidnapped never came back. There are thousands of families who are still waiting for their relatives to be released like Viviana the girl who was celebrating her 13th birthday at the radio station. Viviana's dad has been gone for 11 years almost her entire life. He is part of a small group of political prisoners that the FARC will not free unless the government agrees to a prisoner exchange. So there is nothing the family can do but wait.   Everything Viviana knows about her dad fits easily on top of a coffee table. There is a pile of notebooks filled with his colored pencil drawings the rusted aviator glasses he was wearing when he was kidnapped and a few photographs and videos the FARC has sent as proof he is alive. Vienna was so young when her dad was kidnapped that her only images of him come from these photos and videos.   She says that he is in the jungle but it is impossible to know where because he is posed against a sheet. I remember getting one of those pictures. They call it a  a proof of life. It is like seeing something from another world-- my dad next to a tree in sweatpants and a peasant sweater. My dad is a prisoner. I asked Viviana what her dad looked like in those proofs of life.     She says in the older photos he used to look normal chubby. But in the recent videos he is looking thin and he is going bald. She says that is hard because he used to look stronger. She says she thinks to herself no why is he like that? Life is hard she says. To cope Viviana still talks to her dad and not just over the radio.   She says it is not that she feels he is here. She says she talks to him in her head.   I talked to my dad in my head too. I consulted him about what to major in and I asked for his help at exam time. When my mood would plummet I would think it was somehow connected to what he was going through. And in the worst moments when I would not feel his presence I would look outside and say if he is alive let there be a sign in the next 60 seconds. And I would count down. And inevitably a dog would bark or a street light would turn on. It is like sending the radio messages. You send these little telepathic messages you concentrate and you start to believe someone is out there listening. I have met families who have not had a proof of life for five years or a decade. Their loved ones are probably dead but they act like they are not. They send out messages to them week after week hoping that they are out there in the dark holding a radio. Annie Correal she is a staff reporter for The New York Times. You sometimes hear her on the podcast The Daily. She originally produced a version of this show with Jay Allison for transom.org. I have to say a lot has changed since we first aired this story in 2010. Annie's dad was rescued by the Colombian military along with five other hostages in August 2000. The family moved to Panama which is where her dad Jaime Correal died in 2016 after a short illness. He was 63. That girl who Annie interviewed Viviana-- her dad Edgar Yasid Duarte was killed by the FARC during a failed rescue attempt in 2011. He would been held captive for 13 years. Viviana is in college now studying international relations. The FARC disbanded in 2016 as part of a peace deal with the Colombian government. After that the radio show Voces del Secuestro came to an end. Its final episode was in 2018. Similar programs with messages for hostages also ended. Coming up taken hostage by somebody whose only weapon is paperwork. That is in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues.  It is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Each week on our show of course we choose a theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's show Held Hostage. In this second half of our program we move to people who get held hostage without a gun or a knife or any kind of traditional captor and then they have to figure out what to do. We have arrived at Act Two of our show. Act Two Misdeeds. This is a kind of classic story of people who are not looking for trouble and then the trouble came looking for them. Wayne Curtis tells the story. 11 years ago Tracy Poydras and her husband Oscar were living in New Orleans. Tracy was a nurse in her late 20s. Her husband ran a nightclub in the city. They were planning for their future and they decided to invest in a house. They checked out a city program that seizes blighted properties and sells them cheap and they found a rundown duplex in a decent neighborhood. It was basically just a shell with four walls and a roof and not much of a floor and they spent something like 50000 or 60000 fixing it up. For a while they lived in one unit and rented out the other. Then they moved out and rented both. The whole process went just as they would hoped until 2003 when pretty much out of the blue Tracy Poydras got a call from her tenants. They get eviction notices on the upstairs portion and the down. And they are calling us hysterical. And they are like what is going on? We have paid our rent. I mean do we have some kind of problem? I mean I did not think we had a problem. The eviction papers have been filed by a person who used to own the building a guy named Nathaniel Dowl. Tracy figured it was a misunderstanding of some sort that Dowl was probably just confused and did not understand that the city had seized his property and sold it to somebody new. Whatever it was she was sure a simple explanation would clear things up with Mr. Dowl. She was wrong. And pretty soon Tracy and her husband found themselves in court and for the first time came face-to-face with Dowl and his wife Barbara. I do not know if they had just flown in from a Jamaican retreat or what but Ms. Dowl had on a tie-dye shirt and jeans just clearly not dressed for business not dressed for court. And Mr. Dowl was reeking of marijuana. Reeking. Just to have the nerve to come in there like that I just knew that something was not right you know? Something was definitely not right. After a long day in court the judge asked the Dowls for proof that they owned the building. The Dowls could not come up with any. The judge stopped the eviction. And for a while at least everything was OK. A year went by. Life returned to normal. Then Hurricane Katrina hit and the levees failed. The house the Poydras's had fixed up was now in shambles. Flooding destroyed the first floor and the wind ripped off the roof. Tracy and her husband hired contractors to start fixing up the place all over again. But then not long after the contractor said weird things started happening around the site. Well and they would notice that a hammer would be missing. And then maybe the next day the hammer would come back. I mean just like anything like a crazy Lifetime Movie just all kind of stuff. And then one day someone with no rhyme or reason just someone with like schizophrenia kind of had tape just all over the place just like yellow caution tape. It was just everywhere. And they were like you got to find out what is really going on here. So the next couple of days I went into New Orleans to try to see if maybe the code enforcement or somebody like that had something to do with it. So then when I went in to the real estate-- I forget which office it is called but they are the ones that handle the evictions. And I told them my name and my property address and they were like sighing. They were like oh goodness. Go cross-reference your name. Tracy did not know it just then but she had company and plenty of it. Other people across the city were finding that weird things were happening both with their properties and with the paperwork behind their properties. One of those people was a tall fairly reserved ex-army officer named Brad Robinson. At the time all this started he and Tracy Poydras had never met and they traveled in different worlds. But they both had decided that buying up cheap New Orleans property made good sense. Shortly after Brad got out of the army he and his wife Michelle started a business rehabbing blighted old houses and building new ones. In 2004 they would spotted a house in the city's list of seized buildings so Brad wrote down the address 8633 Zimple Street and drove over to check it out. And that is where I recently met up with Brad. He was waiting there with a stack of photos to show me what the house looked like when he bought it. It was a mess. The grass was several feet high and vines covered it like an ill-fitting toupee. The back part of the house was collapsing and from what I could tell from the pictures the only thing holding up part of it was an old refrigerator. It was so bad that Robinson could not imagine anyone would possibly be living in it much less that the owner would drive up as he stood there slam his car door and storm over to him. It was Nathaniel Dowl the guy who had shown up in court reeking of marijuana. And he said who are you? And I identified myself. And I said I found this house on the city's website and I was looking at purchasing it. And I told him. I said if you want to keep it you have got to do two things. Number one you have got to clean it up. And two I said you have got to go down and pay your taxes because you have got maybe seven years or whatever it was in taxes that were delinquent. And at first he was kind of belligerent the first time I met him. And then once I tried to help him and I told what he needed to do to fix the problem he was talking to me like a friend. Brad actually had a few things in common with Nathaniel Dowl. Both were born and raised in New Orleans. Both were in their 40s. Both were from families that had once bought investment properties here only to lose some of them to the city for neglect or unpaid taxes. So Brad thought it was only fair to give Dowl a shot at keeping his house. But Dowl failed to act. He did not pay his back taxes and the city went ahead and put his house up for auction. Brad picked it up for 10000. A couple days after buying the house Brad and two friends stopped by to check it out. He also wanted to disconnect the electric meter which he worried could be a fire hazard. So we went to pull the meter and the second I pulled the meter back out he came running out the door. And what did he say? Basically he took a baseball bat and threatened me and threatened the other two people with me and said he was sick and tired of the city taking his f-ing properties. Did he come down off the steps? Yeah he chased us out in the street. He was like a mad man. Brad called the cops who cited both men for disturbing the peace. Brad showed the police some papers proving that he had just bought the house so the police told Dowl he had to leave. But Brad had a feeling it was not over. So I drove back I think it was like 11 or 12 oclock at night. And I saw his car parked there and there was a light on inside the premises. Brad called the cops again. And they came out. And they knocked on the door and they instructed Mr. Dowl that they had previously ordered him not to return to the property unless he was accompanied and yada yada. And they placed him in handcuffs for criminal trespass. At that time Mr. Dowl presented a document. It was a restraining order signed by Judge Paul Brown in Division M so the police took the handcuffs off and allowed him to stay in the premises that night. None of this made any sense to Brad. Why would a judge sign a restraining order against him? After all he had not done anything. Besides he owned the house. The next morning I went to see Judge Brown to see why she signed this restraining order TRO. And she had no recollection of signing it. She emphatically denied it. She had her clerk check her book. There was nothing in there. And then she actually walked me to each judge and asked them and their clerks if any other judge had signed her name to a TRO. And they all said no. The TRO was a fake and this is where Nathaniel Dowl's background comes in. Under the advice of his attorney Dowl refused to talk to me. But here's what we know mostly through public records and court documents. Throughout much of his life Dowl ended up in court for stumbling onto the wrong side of the law for car theft for pot for unpaid debts. In 1988 he was sentenced to three years in prison for using bogus money orders. We also know Dowl used to own several houses places he apparently inherited from his father who invested his longshoreman salary in properties. Somewhere along the line Dowl started teaching himself law. He enrolled in a correspondence program and got his paralegal certificate. He learned the basics what legal documents do how to file them what size the paper should be how to make them look official. In fact he learned enough that he could produce fake documents pretty easily. Dowl had a couple of favorite scams. One was to take a bogus document to a notary and would stamp it with a seal. That only meant Dowl signed the document in person in front of the notary. But the seal made things look all the more official and gave the appearance that claims in the document had been verified. Dowl also figured out how to make good use of a run-of-the-mill kind of legal document which and unless you are a lawyer you have probably never heard of. It was something called a quitclaim. While it might sound obscure the idea behind a quitclaim is pretty simple. Let us say you have the rights to a piece of property. You go to the courthouse and file a quitclaim giving those rights to say your cousin. So your cousin now has legal rights to that property. The trick that Dowl figured out was that he could file a quitclaim on any piece of property whether he owned it or not. City officials would look at that document and figure he must have had some rights to begin with because why else would he file it? And so essentially Dowl found that armed with just a small bit of legal knowledge he could trap pretty much anyone he wanted in an upside down topsy-turvy world where all sorts of basic things normally taken for granted just crumble out from beneath you. Brad Robinson's war with Dowl started out small and kind of mundane. Brad sued to get Daniel evicted. Dowl challenged the city's right to take his property. The fight went to the state Supreme Court where Dowl lost. And for a while Robinson's life went back to normal. But then Dowl started showing up in strange places like the houses the Robinsons were working on properties Dowl had never had anything to do with. He would show up at the job sites and pretend to be a buyer of one of the properties and request whoever was there to walk through the property. And later on if he would go down and create these false documents on every one of them. Dowl would file these bogus documents. Robinson would have to track them down and get them thrown out. And here's the thing. It was not like the city or the courts would call Robinson up and say hey Dowl came in again. Instead Robinson had to be constantly watching. I lived down in the inventory archives going through records because he would file a document and I would go pay an attorney to do a mandamus to pull a document out and then he would go back and file another document. So I call him my paper stalker because he would go down it would cost me say 1500 to hire a real attorney to do a mandamus go in front of a judge and the judge would make a ruling and know this was BS. And she would order the document pulled from the public record. And we did this for god knows how many years. And it was over and over and over. How many documents-- do you have any idea-- that you contested with him? I will be honest with you it was on like every piece of property he could find. Dowl went after his old house houses that Robinson was renovating even after Robinson's family home. I was somewhere. I was at a meeting or doing something and my wife called me up in hysterics. I mean absolute hysterics. She had come home from work with the children and there was a notice to vacate posted on the door by a Sheriff's deputy. And she did not know what it was about or what was going on. And she just went into total hysterics. So I went home I got it I went down there and then I did a little research and I found out it was my paper stalker again. What does it take to clear something like that up? We had to go to court. We had to hire another attorney. Over time Dowl grew more brazen. At this point he was just going after Brad with reams of paperwork. But he stepped things up with Tracy Poydras. She is the woman we talked to earlier the woman who found her house covered with caution tape. Not only did Dowl file papers claiming he owned her house he moved in. My mother-in-law went over to the house. And he told her that she could not come in. He told her that she could not come in. And so she thought OK I am going to call the police. So she calls the police. And they tell her he has some kind of document with like a seal on it. And she had some documents and she is like this man does not live here. This is my son's house. And the police were like OK he showed us something saying that he should be in the house so this is a civil matter. And you all have to go to court. We cannot just remove him from the house. And he is in the background like making muscles and doing all kind of little stupid victory dances. And we were like this is just not happening. This house has multiple defense perimeters. It is obvious that you see the shutter and the door but you do not see all the other things. Meet the third person to get into this war with Nathaniel Dowl. Richard Arias is an attorney in his early 60s. He lives in a house that is dark inside because all the solid wood shutters are sealed tight. He explained to me that stems from a paranoia that dates back to his days as an infantryman in Vietnam. He knew both Nathaniel Dowl and Brad Robinson because he owned a house on Zimple Street next door to the one the two first fought over. Dowl was fighting Robinson so Dowl came to me for help. Dowl knew that I was a lawyer so he asked me for help. But that was pretty short-lived because it did not take long for Dowl to turn on Arias to decide Arias was not his ally and to start serving him with fake paperwork and eviction notice all of it. And the thing with Arias he would never bought any properties that Dowl once owned. With Arias it was about vengeance plain and simple. But regardless he found himself in this paper war with Nathaniel Dowl. He learned enough to make it look good. He would go to the courthouse and copy other people's work change it enough but not enough to correct typographical errors not enough to remove references to standard forms not enough to pass the scrutiny of a professional like a judge. Well just enough to get in the door. This went on for more than four years and Arias the Poydrases and the Robinsons all felt trapped. They went to the police who told them it was a matter for the courts. They went to the courts and the judges said they really could not do much except reverse each fraudulent filing as it was presented to them. They went to the district attorney who was struggling with the chaos left in the wake of Katrina and had did not seem too interested in white collar crime. They even went to the court workers the people who accepted Dowl's bogus documents when he filed them. The workers sort of shrugged and tol
