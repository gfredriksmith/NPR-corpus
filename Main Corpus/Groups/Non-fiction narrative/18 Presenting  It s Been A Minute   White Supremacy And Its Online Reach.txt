 You are listening to ROUGH TRANSLATION. I am Gregory Warner. When you are making a podcast from around the world time zones do not always line up. Somebody on the team is getting up in the morning to produce the show and someone else is turning in for the night.   Hello Jess  I am...  This is NPR correspondent Diaa Hadid singing her daughter to sleep in Pakistan...   I have found the act...  ..With words meant for our producer Jess Jiang here in the States.   I am really sorry. This is super weird. But she walked into my office in a meltdown in tears demanding her momma. And I am the only one who fits that description.  This year you may have felt like youve had to juggle work and home or be in two places at once. And maybe ROUGH TRANSLATION has been there for you with stories of people around the world confronting challenges you recognize. So today before we start the show Im asking you to help that work by helping your local public radio station. Even if youre not listening on a radio if you are on your phone or youre in another country as I know many of you are even though our stories are global the way we get to make them is through your support of your local public radio station. And you can let them know we sent you there by visiting this link before the year is out. It is donate.npr.orgtranslation. Again donate.npr.orgtranslation.  It is not really a song. And I will send it to you as soon as I can.  I always love listening to Sam Sanders podcast on NPR called Its Been A Minute. And today we are excited to present an episode of that show one that raises a question I would not have even thought of asking but now I cant stop thinking about. Sam follows a reporter who set out to understand how white supremacy works online. And not just where you can find it and how hateful it is but on a much more fundamental level. How do the different pieces of the white supremacist platform fit together in a kind of rhetoric designed to recruit? This is not a topic of course for everyone. This episode contains detailed conversation about misogyny and racism and sexual violence. It might not be suitable for young children. But one thing that you learn from this show is that hate is not just an emotion. Its a code. And this is an interview with someone who spent the time and some of her own peace of mind to break that code. Youll hear first from that reporter first and then Sam takes the show.    Every day for nearly a year I immersed myself in chat groups and websites and forums where photos of lynchings were passed around like funny memes where Kill Jews was a slogan and murderers were called saints.  That is the voice of Talia Lavin. She is reading from the introduction of her new book.   I silently observed as neo-Nazis mused about what raping me would be like.  And what a book it is.   I spoke to bad people and good people on the front lines of the battle for America.  Lavin's book is called Culture Warlords My Journey Into The Dark Web Of White Supremacy. And the whole thing chronicles Lavin's journey into the nastiest and most unexpected corners of white supremacy sometimes not just online.   I attended a conference for alt-right YouTubers in Philadelphia and was chased out of a casino. I was rejected from joining a white supremacist pagan ritual in the Albany area by the elders of a weightlifting pagan cult called Operation Werewolf. I listened to a terrible white nationalist freestyle-rap diss battle.  Talia spent more than a year doing this research and it was extra complicated for her because Talia is Jewish which means she is one of the targets of the very groups she seeks to expose.   From NPR you are listening to It is BEEN A MINUTE. I am Sam Sanders. On today's show Talia Lavin. We talk about her book Culture Warlords. And this book when you read it you cannot help but wonder why someone would do this. Why infiltrate white supremacist spaces online as a Jewish woman? Talia says she has a reason.  I think this is a movement that is evil and needs to be defeated. You have to understand where they are coming from and what they believe and what they want in order to better combat them. And that is the goal of the book.  After the break how she did it what she found out and why a lot of what you think about white supremacy is wrong.   Let us get into the book Culture Warlords. It is all about you going undercover for a pretty long time to infiltrate the dark web of white supremacy. And this is all further complicated by the fact that you are a Jew. So there is a lot going on in this book and a lot of times in which you are in danger. But I think the best way to start talking about the book and get into some of the themes there is to ask you to describe two of the characters you created to infiltrate that dark web Tommy and Ashlynn. Who are they?  Tommy - I will start with Tommy. So Tommy was a character I used to infiltrate the biggest incel message board on the web. Incel stands for...  Those are involuntary - sorry you say it better than me. Go ahead.  Yeah.  I cut you off. Sorry.  Involuntarily celibate guys. They use that term basically to say like we wish we were getting laid. That is how they sort of portray themselves. But I would describe it as a radicalized misogynist movement because like I have had dry spells. Like...  .  ...I am not going to shoot up a yoga studio about it. Like the - you know I mean...  You are right though.  ...There are a lot of people who cannot...  You are right.  ...Get laid in this world. But what the incel movement actually is is like very deeply radicalized misogyny.  But also white supremacist.  Yeah yeah. There are definitely overlaps between the incel and white supremacist movements.  Got you.  They are not totally - like the overlap is not 100. There are a lot of nonwhite men who identify as incels even just based on like internal polling on this message board that I infiltrated that I am not going to name. But like there was like internal polling. Like are you white or not? And it was like a 60-40 split. Like 40 were nonwhite.  Whoa whoa.  Yeah yeah. So I mean misogyny like does cross the color line. But like...  You do not say.  ...Despite the fact that it was such a heavily nonwhite space - like white supremacists were definitely recruiting there and white supremacist conversation was ubiquitous. There were tons of talks about eugenics. There was sort of the implicit assumption that like white men were at the top tier of like attractiveness and attracting women - like all this stuff. I mean the point that I was sort of trying to make in the book is that white supremacy and misogyny are really deeply deeply intertwined and are braided together especially on the Internet...  Yeah.  ...In ways that are inextricable.  The other character Talia created was Ashlynn Grant . She used that persona to infiltrate a whites-only dating site. What is it called?  Whitedate.net.  Well that gets right to it .  Their slogan is for a Europid vision.  Wow.  Like the idea of propagation and reproduction is like a really big part of the white supremacist movement and so it was like really funny. You had this incredibly elaborate drop-down menu for like what specific flavor of white you are. Like are you like...  Give me some examples.  Are you like Welsh Danish like Scottish Irish Gaelic whatever - like this - the whole panoply of possible European ancestries. You could pick your ideology which was like - ranged from fully red-pilled which is sort of term for like are you an extremist racist to like getting there. I mean it was like almost like choosing a swatch...  Wow.  ...For like a white wall.  Wow.  Like you are like eggshell alabaster ivory.  Oh my God.  Eventually I sort of began to see it as more of an anthropological study of just like who signs up for an all-white dating site?  Yeah.  So I had them write love letters to their ideal white wife and send them to me...  Stop it. Were they good writers?  ...And I printed them in the book. What I write is they were just like this car crash between like Nicholas Sparks and Mein Kampf. Like it was very...  Oh my God .  It was like very cheesy romance but also like they were like we will raise our wolf pack together. Like you know we will keep our kids away from the Communists and the darkies. I want to kiss you in a wheat field while the sun shines.  Whoa whoa whoa.  Like together we will prosper under the moon . Like it was very dramatic prose but also very racist.  Yeah.  It was like - it was wild.  Yeah.   So Talia did this for more than a year and she took on more personas than Tommy and Ashlynn. I had to ask her why this level of embedding? One reason Talia says is that being a Jewish woman made it impossible to get through the front door with her real identity. But there was another reason.  The other reason was that I have seen so many times you know journalists very uncritically - you know I understand the conventions of our profession and like the sort of legal and ethical requirement to get comment from the groups you are talking about. But spokespeople for white nationalism lie. That is what they do. Their whole job is to make it seem like their movement is not inherently violent and genocidal. So to the point of almost true absurdity I have seen local news like describe white supremacist gatherings in their own words as white wellness advocates like it is like Goop for fascism or this idea of like we just peacefully want a white ethnostate. And like to a certain extent I was sick of like the smooth-talking spokespeople portraying white nationalism as more peaceful than it was. And I think one advantage to my approach which was like infiltrating these chats you know in character or just lurking or infiltrating in character engaging in conversation and then writing about it was that I was able to see their rank and file much more clearly - what they were talking about their sort of preoccupations the tenor of the conversation in these rooms - because I was actively engaging in infiltration.  This level of involvement took its toll. At one point Talia says she was sometimes playing five or six characters a day online.  Got very like psychologically complicated.  Yeah. You got in your head. Was there like a particular moment where you are like I might be in too deep either in your own head or in real life?  I mean I definitely - one of the more difficult moments - and I actually open Chapter 1 with this just to like give an impression of kind of the load that this takes - was like so I had infiltrated a particularly violent chat room that I would been told featured a lot of people who were accelerationists. That is - those are people who push for civilizational collapse in order to further white nationalist ideas.  Pushing for the race war basically.  Yeah the boogaloo the race war the hootenanny the day of the rope - you know the part where they get to shoot the people they hate. So I was in this very violent chat room. And all of a sudden - I like log in at 4 oclock in the morning because I cannot sleep and they are talking about me Talia Lavin. They - they are like would you rape her? You know? And like...  Oh my God. I am so sorry.  And they were like oh - you know the conclusion by most is that I was too ugly to rape but that you could rape me with a shotgun and that would be OK. And so...  Oh God. And you are in there reading this in one of your aliases?  Yeah and they do not know that I am there they are just discussing me in absentia. So like that was a really weird moment for me where I am like oh boy like I - the stuff I am exposing myself to is like very toxic. And I think I got pretty depressed like while writing the book because you feel like you are - it is almost like a bell jar. You are sealed off from everything good in the world and you are immersed in just the toxic silence of hate where nothing good can pierce it.  Yeah. You know one of the things that you write about is how the things that these supremacists are talking about in these corners of the Internet are very serious - genocide and race wars et cetera - but they talk about it in some really kind of immature crude language. You write in the book quote the corpses they long to create are buried under slick layers of euphemism and crude humors. Basically the folks wanting the race war are also dealing memes and like tongue-in-cheek rhetoric as if they are teenage boys. What do you think that is about?  So I think one of the more interesting documents that reveals this dynamic is The Daily Stormer style guide. So The Daily Star is like...  Right. They have a style guide.  Yes and it got leaked to Ashley Feinberg...  Wow.  ...At the Huffington Post when she worked there. So it is this 12-page document that basically tells you how to write a Daily Stormer post. The Daily Stormer is like the neo-Nazi broadsheet of the Internet. And like the biggest sort of instruction they had was keep the tone light and outsiders should not be able to tell if you are joking or not. Of course I do want to gas all the kikes but an outsider should not be able to tell that. And so there is this very deliberate use of humor. I mean Brenton Tarrant the man who shot 53 people at a Christchurch mosque you know I read his manifesto. It contained jokes. It had memes in it.  Really?  And he went out and he...  Really?  And he went out and shot 50 people. He was pretty  serious about his ideology.  Yeah yeah.  But the goal is always to retain this element of plausible deniability always to maintain this veneer of detached irony both to draw in people who - for whom like Internet irony is appealing which is a lot of us. A lot of people find edgy jokes appealing. And those edgy jokes can condition you to dehumanize people. Like these chats are just absolutely flooded with videos gory videos of Black people dying and like jokes about it. And once human beings and their deaths are punchlines for you you are a lot closer to killing them.  After the break Talia Lavin on why white supremacy cannot exist without anti-Semitism.   Hey. This is Gregory Warner host of NPRs ROUGH TRANSLATION. Of course this week we are turning over our show to Sam Sanders and this episode of Its Been A Minute. I am briefly though coming back into your feed just to say that all of the work that we do here at NPR we are able to do thanks to your support of your local public radio station. So here's the link to visit and show that support - donate.npr.orgtranslation. Again donate.npr.orgtranslation. Thanks. And now back to Sam.   I want to talk about the ways in which you explain in the book how anti-Semitism is required for a lot of this ideology to work. I got to start by saying you write about being Jewish and being very Jewish in this lovely way. You write quote of yourself in real life I am a schlubby bisexual Jew living in Brooklyn with long brown ratty curls the matronly figure of a mother in a Philip Roth novel and a brassy personal politic that is not particularly sectarian but falls considerably to the left of Medicare for All. But you go on to talk about how this white supremacist ideology requires the Jew to create what you call a holistic system of depravity. What is that? Explain that to our listeners.  First of all everyone loves the I am a schlubby bisexual Jew quote. And my mom called me and was like it says you are bisexual in The New York Times and all my friends keep texting me about it.   You had not told her?  No I...   Oh my God.  I had. She knew. But she is like all my friends keep texting me that you are bisexual. And I am like OK well I am. So I guess they all know now.  .  Anyway back to anti-Semitism - the white power movement guys that I was primarily writing about and their system of ideology - like anti-Semitism is really inextricable from the kind of ideological or intellectual underpinnings of their entire worldview. And I would say when you look at the Jew the way they do a sort of an omnipresent omnipotent enemy pulling the strings they believe that Jews are sort of systematically orchestrating white genocide a very popular conspiracy theory the idea that the white population is being intentionally diluted via mass migration and via like higher birth rates for people of color. And there is this idea that this is an existential threat to the existence of the white race. So the idea that the Jew is like organizing all this...  This is what was so crazy. Like I had never even heard of that idea this idea that like all nonwhites are bad but Jews are the worst ones because they are the ones who are passing as white and organizing all the other nonwhites to defeat the white man. I had never - whoa.  Yeah. Like anti-Semitism and anti-Blackness and you know racism generally are like so intimately intertwined. And it actually goes really far back. If you look at like the anti-civil rights movement in the mid-20th century there was this idea that like the NAACP was funded by Jewish communists that this was all a Jewish plot. And if you go like really deep into what they actually believe it is like why would Jews be doing that? It is because they are also super racist and believe that like people of color or mixed-race people are sort of more malleable to Jewish control because they are stupider. I mean certainly white grievance is an industry and it is - it has a lot of its own bananas proof text. But like on the surface it is pretty hard to argue that white men are like the most oppressed demographic in the United States. So you have to invent an enemy that is stronger than you and bent on your destruction. And that is the rhetorical function of the Jew in the white supremacist worldview - that like he is infinitely cunning infinitely resourceful and like hell-bent on the destruction of the white race. And this allows you the white supremacist to posit yourself as sort of oppressed just righteous and like fighting against an incalculable demonic evil. And that is an important rhetorical function to serve.   There is another thing that I had to ask Talia about. It is impossible right now to talk about white supremacy and not talk about Donald Trump. Since he announced his run for the presidency his rhetoric on race and identity it is wandered dangerously close to that of white supremacist. Talia says white supremacists do like a lot of what he says but they also dislike a lot of what he does. And the relationship between Trump and white supremacy well it is more complicated than you think.  In 2016 I mean his campaign and his victory were just these enormous shots of adrenaline to the movement in ways that really cannot be overstated. I mean just massive new recruitment new groups springing up overnight. And then there has been significant disillusionment from specifically sort of the most hardcore white power guys over the last few years with electoralism in general with Trump in particular because he surrounded himself with Jews you see. I know it sounds horrible to say these things. It is - but this has been my life for the last two years is just like studying this stuff.  Yeah.  I would say the - just as Trump has formed the Republican Party in his image in very real ways the reverse is also true. Like one of the funnier moments that I was sort of chronicling for the book was when Brad Griffin the sort of chief propagandist for the neo-Confederate League of the South wrote this like super pissed-off blog post around the 2018 midterms being like Trump is campaigning on white nationalism but like he is not really doing anything about it.  Wow.  So he was so mad. Like he is like they are taking our thing. They are taking our shtick but they are not doing anything about it.  .  But it was just - but it was like the white nationalists...  Well yeah.  ...Were like openly being like yes he is campaigning on white nationalism. This is like the...  Yeah yeah.  This is what he is appealing to.  Yeah. One of the things you write about in the book is how contrary to what some on the left might think this white supremacist boom it is actually bigger than Trump. And in some ways it is quite fundamentally opposed to Trump and the Republican Party. You have already mentioned that a lot of white supremacists do not like the fact that Jewish people work in Trump's White House. But also a lot of white supremacist ideology is a resentment of capitalism and resentment of corporations and anger at things like Trump's support for Israel right? Like why do not more people know that  there are these distinctions?  Well I think the white power movement the extremist right like it has a lot of different tranches and subdivisions. And like I think it is very tempting for a lot of people to want to just flatten it and say they are all like  Nazis. Like the militia movement is very pro-Trump you know very - they talk about Constitution patriot liberty American eagle. You know we will shoot anyone because we are - basically like we view ourselves as the real police in America. But the white power guys that I looked into - and I was specifically looking into sort of white power on the Internet and these specific sort of accelerationist communities people who very openly embraced Hitler and Nazism. And they did have yes substantial differences with the Republican Party like the support of Israel the support of Jews. Like anti-Semitism was a huge dividing point.  So much of Talia's research for her book involved her being in the story personally living in those chatrooms online taking on different personas to go in deep and ultimately showing up in white supremacist spaces herself. Reading the book I kept worrying about her. So my last question to Talia it was not about anti-Semitism or white supremacy it was about her. Reading the book I just kept saying oh my goodness. How much has she been through? Is she experiencing PTSD from this? Like are you mentally emotionally all right? Be honest.   I mean I started collecting swords during the writing of the book. I have about six now.  Man OK. OK.  Like the FBI has been to my house to tell me there are death threats and rape threats against me. It is like...  Oh my goodness.  ...Sometimes rough. But my feeling is that I am still angrier than I am scared and more determined than I am angry. Like if I had to decide knowing what it did to me to write this book again like I would. You know I think this is a really important movement to expose and to understand just because they want to think of themselves as bogeymen who can scare you. Like they do not get to take away my right to talk.  They do not get to take away my right to explain who the hell they are. You know this is going to be around for a long time .  Yeah.  And we need people in the fight.  For people who are hearing this chat who think this is maybe just a phase and that this crazy groundswell of white racism will die down - and a lot of them will say you know you have to ignore it because if you pay too much attention to it you grant these people legitimacy and airtime - what would you say to them?  It is a careful line to walk. And I have seen examples of journalism that felt more like glorification than edification. I think that what I tried to do was to like keep it 100 with people like just say from the start I think this is a movement that is evil and needs to be defeated and that tracing their ideology and its motivations is an empowering means to do that because you have to understand your enemy. You have to understand where they are coming from and what they believe and what they want in order to better combat them. And that is the goal of the book. You know it is - I tried not to sensationalize but to map patterns of radicalization and how people get there. Some of it winds up being sensational just because it is a really  weird subculture with a lot of like bizarreness and a lot of florid violence. But I think I avoided glorifying them and more just showed them as like the crude repulsive very human and very ugly Movementarians they are. And again like the goal is just to really - by the end of the book I want you up in arms. And I sort of give people a little path towards how to do it.   Thanks again to Talia Lavin. Her book Culture Warlords is out now.   This episode was produced by Andrea Gutierrez. It was edited by Jordana Hochman. Listeners we are back in your feeds on Friday. Until then stay safe. Take care of yourself. All right. Until next time I am Sam Sanders. We will talk soon.
