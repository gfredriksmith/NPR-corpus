 You are listening to Radiolab. From WNYC and NPR. Jad Hey I am Jad Abumrad. Robert I am Robert Krulwich. Jad This is Radiolab. Robert The podcast. Jad Does that how it usually works? Do you say the podcast?  Yes. Jad Somehow it just sounded so different to me then. Robert So different. Jad Something just got--- That is really how we did it? Robert I thought we could try that. Jad We could just do it differently then. Robert Let us do it differently. Should I go first? Jad Go first. Robert That always shocks you. Jad Do it. Robert Hi I am Robert Krulwich. Jad I am Jad Abumrad. Robert This is Radiolab. Jad The podcast. Robert On this podcast we are going to have a conversation. Not an easy conversation I would not say. Jad No. It begins really with a difficult question maybe the most difficult question a person can be asked. Asking for us is our producer Sean Cole. Sean Well this story starts with a doctor.  Sean A guy named Joseph Gallo. Hello can you hear me Joe? Joseph Yes. Sean Great. He is a real sweetheart actually. Joseph I feel like a celebrity you are sending a sound person here to record. Sean Joe's an MD but he is also a professor. Joseph At Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. Sean He is been working on a study that I just frankly find totally fascinating. Joseph If I ramble just stop me. Sean Here's the story. A long time ago.  Joseph In the 1940s and early 50s- Sean -Johns Hopkins launched something called the Precursor Study and all of these graduating medical students- Joseph -1337 students- Sean -signed up- Joseph -between 1948 and 1964. Sean Every one of them agreed to be poked prodded examined up and down. Joseph Their blood pressure their weight. Sean Asked all these questions. Joseph Their habits. How much exercise they took. They did a Rorschach inkblot test. Jad Wow. What was the point of this study? Sean Well originally it was just to pinpoint the precursors to heart disease but over time the study went way beyond that and the researchers started asking all sorts of other questions. Joseph Questions about depression anxiety. Sean 50 years of the study and the doctors are getting older and older and- Joseph Social support retirement. Sean At a certain point about 15 years ago Joe and the other researchers start to ask these doctors about death. Joseph If you have that paper in front of you? Sean Yes hang on. Essentially what they did was they presented the doctors many of whom are now in their 60s 70s and 80s with the following scenario. Joseph What scenario is there? Sean It says-- It goes something like this. Say you have brain damage or some brain disease that cannot be cured you cannot recognize people you cannot speak understandably and you are in this condition for a long time. Robert You are brain dead? Joseph Well you are not brain dead but it describes maybe a scenario that is like severe dementia. Sean Then it says Indicate your wishes regarding the use of each of the following medical procedures. Joseph There is a list. 10 CPR IV fluids major surgery. Sean There is a bunch of them. Jad The question they are asking is if I am in this terrible situation would I want these things? Sean Would you agree to have these things done to you if it came down to it?  Sean What would you say as an example? Robert You are asking us now? Sean Yes and I also put the question to a bunch of people on the street. My name's Sean Cole I am a reporter with- Robert Give me one. Sean CPR for example so you are heart stops. CPR. Jad Would I want CPR? Sean Yes. Robert Yes. I want somebody to do that.  Yes.  Sure.  Yes.  Yes.  Well yes. Jad Seems like a no-brainer. Sean What about mechanical ventilation? It is a breathing machine. Robert A breathing machine? Sean You are going to die if you do not get it. Robert Well maybe. Jad Then yes okay.  Yes.  Yes.  Sure.  Yes I would not say do not do it . Jad You remember all of them? Sean Kidney dialysis? Jad Yes.  Yes. Robert I think so yes. Sean A feeding tube?  Yes.  Yes. Sean Major surgery?  I do not know. Jad Like a gall bladder operation? If we are just talking about the gall bladder. Sean Gall bladder sure. Jad Yes. Robert Yes. Sean Antibiotics?  Yes. Jad Totally.  Sure.  sure. Sean IV hydration?  Yes.  Yes. Robert Obviously. Sean You would want all that?  Yes. Robert Yes yes and yes. Sean That is what most people say. They want most everything. Maybe not some of the super invasive stuff but generally yes. On the other hand you ask the doctors what they want same situation brain dead or brain-injured whatever do they want CPR? Joseph 90 say no. They would not want CPR. Jad Really? Robert Really? Jad 90? Robert 90? Sean Yes I mean I asked a bunch of doctors at a vascular health conference here in New York.  Each of the following medical procedures. Sean They said the same thing. CPR?  No CPR.  No.  No CPR.  No CPR. Joseph Almost 90 would not want ventilation.  No. Joseph Or dialysis?  Definitely not.  No no no. Joseph 80 would not want surgery.  No. Joseph 80 would not want invasive testing.  No no. Joseph Almost 80 would not want a feeding tube. Jad What?  No. Joseph Or a blood product.  No. Joseph Antibiotics 60 would say-  Not really. Joseph IV hydration about 60. Jad Say no? Joseph They do not.  Probably not. Joseph Then Pain medicine is the one that is a bit different. Sean The actual item on the survey reads Would you opt for pain medications even if they dull the consciousness and indirectly shorten my life? Joseph There are 80 of them say-  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Pain reliever? Yes.  Absolutely.  Yes.  Yes.  More.  Painkiller yes.  Yes.  Pain medication yes. Jad Pain medication that is all they want? Sean For the most part yes. Robert Why would there be such a big gap between doctors and patients? Jad In terms of how they want to end their life? Robert Yes. Sean Well. Hi is that you? Ken It is me. Sean Great to meet you. Ken You also Sean? Sean How are you doing? It started to become clear to me when I talked with Ken Murray he is also a doctor. You are in your doctor whites here. Ken I thought I would impress you. Sean I met up with him at a hospital in Los Angeles. He is written a bunch of articles now about how doctors want to die. Ken This exact question was asked. Sean I asked him why is there this difference particularly with something like CPR? What is it that doctors know that we are not aware of? Ken Well we know that CPR is basically pretty terrible as an intervention. It basically does not work very well. People just do not believe that. They just cannot believe it. Sean For a very good reason.  Ken There was a study done in 1996 about how many people survive CPR intervention on ER Chicago Hope Rescue 911. It is '96 those were hot shows then. The researcher watched all of these medical dramas and recorded what the result was.  Come on you can do it. Come back to us Dawn. Do it come on. Two three four. Ken The answer was 75 of the time people-  Come on. Come one. Okay get the oxygen. Easy breaths. Ken -were revived.  Come on nice easy breaths.  Ken It worked 75 of the time.  Easy breaths easy breaths Dawn. Ken The actual number is more like eight. Jad 8? Sean Roughly 8 survive to at least a month. Jad Wow. Ken In fact it is worse than that. Jad Here's how that 8 breaks down. Ken When you actually break it down there was a fellow who did a study in 2010. He looked at 95000 cases. Actually more than that. I think it was all the cases in Japan that year. What he found was that about 3 had what you would call a good outcome. That is return to a meaningful quality of life. Sean You and me sitting here talking and eating sandwiches? Ken Exactly. About the same number- Sean 3 or so. Ken -ended up in a chronic vegetative state. Not quite brain dead but pretty close. Sean The final 2- Ken -were in some sort of intermediate level. Not good but they were not comatose. Everybody else was dead. That is the reality of it and we physicians we know that. We have actually done CPR. We have actually laid hands on the chest. Sean Here's something I did not know. Ken says that when you do CPR you often end up cracking the person's ribs. Robert Wow. Sean And yet that according to Ken is mild in terms of some of the things that doctors put patients through. Ken I think a lot of times we are doing things to people that we would not do to a terrorist. Sean Is that true or is that overstated? Ken I am not kidding. Sean Like what kinds of things? Ken Well paralyzing somebody so that you cannot move which you generally have to do when you put a person on a ventilator. A breathing machine. A respirator. When you put somebody on one of these machines it breathes for you but the problem is you will fight it because you will have your own rhythm. What happens is you have a person that is fighting fighting fighting fighting and you cannot get air in and out of them so you paralyze them. Sean So they stop fighting? They cannot move. Ken It does not mean they are asleep. They are not asleep. They are completely helpless. Yet they are aware of everything that is going on around them. Sean Sounds nightmarish actually. Ken Yes. Sean Ken took me through a bunch of different situations from congestive heart failure to lung disease and pancreatic cancer where he feels basically that the treatment is worse than the actual disease what you have. It may be prolonging but not for very long and the life that you have left is misery. Ken Right. Sean In fact Ken says the colleagues of his other doctors- Ken They will turn to me in the ICU and they say If you find me like this kill me and they are not kidding. Sean He says there are doctors who wear medallions with the words No code stamped on them which just means do not resuscitate me. He is even seen tattoos that say no code. Can I talk to you now? Ken Yes. Sean Come on. Turn that off. Jad Sean can I just break in for one second? Sean Yes. Jad While you were reporting this piece a very strange coincidence happened to me. I was visiting my dad and after dinner one night he sits me down and he says I have something important I want to tell you. I have signed an advanced directive which basically means if I end up in the hospital terminally ill or something I do not want a lot of medical stuff done to me. I had not told him about your story at all. Sean Really? Jad Yes. Sean So it was just out of the blue? Robert He shows you a piece of paper? Jad No not then. I just saw him a couple of days ago and asked him to read it to me because I had not actually seen it yet. What does it say? Jad's dad It says I direct that medical care be withheld or withdrawn and that I be permitted to die naturally with only the administration of medications. Jad You can skip over that paragraph. Jad's dad I authorize the withholding of artificially provided food intravenous fluids and other nourishments. Jad If I cannot I give directions regarding my medical care I intend that my family physicians honor this declaration as a final expression of my legal right to refuse medical care and I accept the consequences of that refusal. Pain medication is all you really want? Jad's dad Yes to keep me comfortable. Jad What was I saying? It is like the baby's crying. Why would not you want artificially provided food intravenous fluids or other nourishment? Jad's dad That is my choice. Jad I know but that does not sound like it is that much of an intervention really. Jad's dad It is an intervention to sustain life unnecessarily if I should ever have a terminal condition. Jad Would you want CPR done? Jad's dad If I have a choice the answer is no. Jad Would not you want mom or I to be in a position where we can make the decision? Jad's dad What if you conflict? Jad Like she feels one way and I feel another? Jad's dad Yes. Jad He told me this is one of the worries that doctors have that they will talk to the patient or the patient's family explained the situation carefully and everyone's agreed no more interventions. Then a random family member will just show up like a cousin or an estranged son or daughter maybe carrying a lot of guilt and they are like Do doc you have to do whatever it takes. Jad's dad At the end of the day I give the option to the patient and to the family to make a decision. That is what I have to do. Jad Except in this case the patient is him. By having this it means we have to honor this. We cannot have our own feelings about it. Jad's dad You can have your own feelings but you still have to honor this. Jad The thing that gives me pause is that you are a doctor your job is to prolong life and to sustain life and you choose not to when it comes to your own life. Jad's dad Nobody said my job is to sustain life. My job is to sustain life when it is possible. It is not to sustain life when it is futile and if you are going to sustain my life on a respirator I do not want it. That kind of life I do not want.  Jad's dad More than anything the thing he wanted to make sure of is that he does not die in a hospital. He definitely does not want to die at the place where he works. Sean That is something that came up a few times among the doctors at the conference that I went to. Tim Ryan I think I do not want to die in a hospital bed. Jad This is Tim Ryan a resident at Cleveland Clinic. Sean Why not? Tim Because I see patients and patients' families suffer tremendously and I think we do a poor job of communicating futility to them. I do not know how to communicate that effectively. I do not know how to do it better. It is a difficult thing to bring up to the family. How do you tell them Your grandfather is not going to get better. We can keep him alive for a few weeks or a few months but he is probably going to have a tracheostomy and a feeding tube a catheter in his bladder and then he will get bedsores and slowly deteriorate? I think we can focus on extending a life that has some quality so they can interact with their family but once that is gone I do not know that we do much benefit. Sean That sounded great. That was perfect. Why do not you just you say that? Tim I do not know. You have to have a sense that people want to hear that. Sean No one would want to hear that but they would need to hear it. Tim It is a little bit presumptuous. Sean You cannot tell someone not to hope. You cannot pressure them to just let go of their loved one and obviously you cannot refuse to provide care. Jad You know though there is one thing that struck me there talking to my dad. There is a question that patients will sometimes ask that can be a bridge between doctors and patients. Very often he says when people are in the middle of this decision they will turn to him and they will say Doc what would you do if this was your mother or father? He says when they ask the question that way it creates an entirely different conversation. He can say Here's what I would honestly do. Or in fact I did not know this. Here's what I actually did. Jad's dad It happened with my parents when my father fell and developed complications as a result of the fall. Jad He says he called the doctor and told them no more medical interventions. Jad's dad He ended up dying comfortably. Same thing happened with my mother I had discussed it with my mother and my father when they were not sick. This was a plan. I can tell you in 90 of the patients that I see such planning does not happen. Ken I had a habit for most of my career. When I would have a new patient come in particularly over the age of 50 I would ask him How do you want to die? Sean This is Ken Murray again. Ken A lot of them would give me a funny look. That is an odd question for a doctor to be asking me. I said It is the one thing we can be sure of it is going to happen eventually and I want to make sure it happens the way you want. People the typical answer is I would like to die in my sleep painlessly.  The fastest way without any pain.  Peaceful.  Without pain and with friends. Ken Which is how most people answer the question. Jad Doctors and non-doctors.  With the least amount of pain and not drag it on.  Swiftly and painlessly. Ken What is that? What actually is that? That is usually a heart attack or a stroke something of that nature. That happens just like that and you are gone. Jad That is what we and our doctors are essentially doing everything in our power to avoid. When you ask people in the abstract they are saying-  How do I want to die? Peacefully. Jad I want to die peacefully I want to die in my sleep and everything like that but when you ask them the specifics you hear No. Pound on my chest stick a tube down my throat. It is this paradox. Robert It sounds to you like a paradox but think about it. It could be it is so so healthy to do both even at the same time. It is healthy to want to stay and it is healthy to know how to be ready to go. I was listening to a Fresh Air retake and they had Maurice Sendak on the air who died not too long ago. Before he died he was on Fresh Air. Jad It was an amazing interview. Robert Terry Gross was talking to him and he is sitting there in his Connecticut house looking out the window at a tree. He says to Terry I am so in love with the tree and the beauty of it and my chance to keep it company just a little while longer. I want to stay and every extra day I get is a day that is precious to me and makes me want to stay even harder. Buddy says to Terry I am ready to go when it is time. I have made myself ready. That compromise you make with yourself to love it with your whole soul and yet at the same time say I will know when it is over and I am composed enough and prepared enough to take my exit that is what a good death is.  Jad Thank you Sean Cole. Sean You are welcome. Robert This is Sean Cole's it is not his last appearance here but this is the last time he is on our full pay-check. He is going off to host many things and be a reporter in other places. Jad It is a kind of death really. Sean It is nothing like a kind of death. Robert A good death though. It would mean Sean that you would come back here regularly. Sean I will. I will haunt you all. Jad You better. Sean Special thanks to everybody at the VEITHsymposium on Vascular health.
