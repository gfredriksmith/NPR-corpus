     All right. Should we get -- should we -- ? Yeah.   Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   And today just for kicks we are gonna start in a park. So let me set the scene.   Please.   Couple days ago we gathered a bunch of Radiolab listeners in McCarren Park in Brooklyn.   You guys are amazing for coming out today. Thank you so much.   This is a random set of listeners.   Random set of listeners. Whoever showed up as a result of a few tweets and Facebook postings. Got about 70 people. It was a super cold day. Park was covered in snow. And we had brought everybody there to help us make some noises that we would use in this segment. Like ...     Gasping. Or ...     Chanting. Or -- it was amazing. You will hear them throughout the hour. But when people got there we had not actually explained to them why we wanted them to make these noises. So just to start things off I just asked them a couple questions.   Okay. So ...   Questions of the moment.   First let me just ask. How many of you guys like football?     How many of you guys hate football?     This was not a shocking revelation.   No. Kind of expected.   How many of you guys think that football will disappear in the next 10 years?     But these anti-football sentiments I believe they say more about you and I and our fans than the game.   Although I -- in fairness I mean there are a lot of people who -- I would even consider myself a -- a -- I watch for the ads.   Okay. Whether you watch for the ads like you or whether you love the game like I happen to or loathe it like some others football right now ...   Is huge!           Its massive.   It is massively popular. That is not the same as ...   I actually think it is massively interesting also. Here's a way to think about it. Sally Jenkins the author of the book The Real All-Americans she puts it this way. Imagine a thousand years from now maybe ten thousand maybe a hundred thousand years from now we are all gone. All our history has been forgotten. All the silly trifling games we play have been lost to time. Imagine the future human beings looking back on us.   Let us say you know some archaeologists goes around digging. They are gonna find these really really huge stadiums.  That is what they are gonna find. Okay?   Yeah.   And they are gonna understand just like we understand about the Greeks what was really important to us.   Okay so here's the thing Radiolab listeners. We are gonna do an entire hour on the game of football. In part because it just seems to be that there are a lot of questions in the air about football right now about what it really is and what that means about us. What it might or could or cannot become.   Am I gonna like this?   Absolutely! This -- in a way this whole hour is for the people like you who really do not care about football. And I am willing to wager that at the end they will care more. Particularly because of this first story which comes from Sally Jenkins who just heard. It comes from her book The Real All Americans This is a story not about the game as you might think of it now but about where it came from. It did not come from the people you would expect.   Okay I am folding my hands. And you see here in my lap and I am going to listen to this.   Okay you want to get in the three-point stance?   71! 71 Hike! We are ready to begin.   And this is a story about the beginning.   Well ...   Or not quite.   I mean football -- football is as old as sort of the Celtic civilizations. I mean you can trace primal games of you know Danish invaders kicking skulls around the shores of England. I mean ...   That is not football. That is just skull-kicking.   Exactly. But organized football's really a creation of the 1860s and '70s in this country. It is a post-Civil War creation. Comes along just really a couple of years after you know the last great conquering armies settle the West.   Basically she says you had these kids whose parents had fought in the Civil War and then some of them had gone west to fight the Lakota the Cheyenne the Arapaho the Apaches. And now those wars were winding down which oddly enough created kind of an issue for young men at the time.   If you are a young student say back east at a fancy school like Harvard how are you gonna prove your own toughness? I mean your older brother your father they maybe fought at Gettysburg Battle of Little Bighorn.   What the hell have you done?   The American frontier experience was over. There was this feeling among a lot of intellectuals that -- that American men were losing their masculinity. They were being feminized in a sense.   And so according to historian David Adams who you just heard those kids were desperate for opportunities to man up.   There was this cult of manliness.   Around this time says David Adams you see a bunch of violent sports take off. And in particular for our purposes you see these kids at Harvard and Yale getting together and knocking the snot out of each other in this game that is kind of like rugby but just more violent.   The game used to be basically brutality.   The origin of football was such a profoundly different game.   Writer Chuck Klosterman and before him historian. Dr. Conrad Crane.   You know a first down instead of 10 yards was only five yards.   You had three downs to get five yards.   And basically all the teams did was sort of slam into each other and try to move the ball incrementally. It was almost as if every play of the entire game was a goal-line stand. You know the metaphor people always use when discussing football of course is military. It is the idea of taking land and giving like -- well the origin of football that was even amplified.   There were formations and strategies and that kind of thing but it was pure like right out of Napoleon's military playbook. I mean where you -- you concentrate your force.   Yeah my shoulder next to your shoulder next to his shoulder. It is like a line.   Yeah you bunch up all -- all your men and then pierce the other guy's army.   Yeah.   That was the basic idea.   And so you just end up with piles of guys.   Yeah and inside those piles?   There is all kinds of things that go on in those scrums. I mean there is kicking there is biting there is gouging.   Eye-gouging and crotch kicking and ...   Wow!   Head-wrenching.   Remember we are talking about Harvard boys doing this.   I have to work to imagine that because I think of Harvard and Yale now and I think of like I think of ...   Pencil-neck geeks?   Yeah I do not think of them as big guys.   Well at the time they were the -- I mean there are all these wonderful stories about these chops that they would eat for dinner. I mean they were drinking milk by the gallon and the Ivys were the great power of the time physically as well as intellectually.   But then along comes this school this tiny little school founded in 1879 in the middle of nowhere that if you are a football fan or just a fan of American history kind of changed everything.   Where was Carlisle?   Carlisle was in Pennsylvania right -- very close to Gettysburg.   Well let us go there. So -- so tell me about Car -- what is the -- when is it formed? And what was it there?   The Carlisle Indian School is formed by a former -- well actually he was an active military officer at the time named Richard Henry Pratt.   Big guy. Shock of white hair. Large nose.   Pratt had serve gallantly quite gallantly in the Civil War. And then he had actually served out west in Oklahoma Territory. He had fought American Indians himself.   And it was after winning a lot of those fights too many of those fights really we are talking 1870s now that Pratt had a change of heart. And he -- he suddenly became concerned about the very people he had just been fighting.   The fact of the matter is that Indians were in a very very desperate situation. The bison were almost extinct. They were being pushed onto reservations and population had fallen to -- to its almost all-time low. Pratt and a lot of other policymakers came to the conclusion that something had to happen fast or Indians would literally become extinct. They would in fact become the vanishing race. And so Pratt ...   He comes to Washington with an idea.   His idea was to start a boarding school specifically for American Indian children that was kind of a radical experiment.   Children would be taken removed for several years at a time. They would be stripped of their what was called their savage heritage and they would be civilized.   I.E. They would be white-itized.   It was -- it was forcible assimilation. Pratt had a slogan Kill the Indian save the man.   That is Barbara Landis.   Carlisle Indian School biographer.   We went up to Carlisle to talk with her and her colleague Cara Curtis. And they told us that Pratt basically made that pitch ...   Kill the Indian save the man.   ... not just to Congress but directly to American Indian families all over the country.   I want your son. Is that -- how does that work?   I want your children because ...   White people are gonna keep coming and coming. They want to settle in your lands. They want to take your lands. And you need to learn how to deal with these people. So we need to teach your children how to speak English.   We need to teach them how to communicate with the white man so that when the white man comes and tries to get you to sign away the Black Hills you will not fall for it again.   And it was a convincing argument.   Well you know back in those days you are talking about survival over here.   Would you mind introducing yourself?   Okay my name is Joe American Horse. I am 79 years old and I am a grandson of Chief American Horse.   Joe lives near the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota. He is Lakota. And he told us the story about his grandfather who was a famous Lakota chief. In the 1890s his grandpa led a delegation of American Indians to Washington.   Well he went to Washington DC. And he was down there but he said there was a lot of people down there.   Joe says his grandpa had this moment where he was just stunned by how many white people there were. His phrase was They are like ants.   And pretty soon they are gonna come to our area. So he had the idea of trying to send his kids to school so they can intermingle or you know intercept whatever.   Basically Joe says his grandpa just had this realization.   We cannot -- we cannot go back. We got to go forward.   And it seemed to him Carlisle was the way forward.   So where are we going now?   This is our photo archive.   As kids were admitted here's how it would work. They would come in and they would immediately have their picture taken on arrival. Then they would be given an extreme makeover which would also be photographed.   Okay this is Tom Torlino.   Wow. So this is -- this is Tom Torlino as he -- as he comes in.   Mm-hmm.   Barbara showed us a picture of a Navajo kid looking maybe 18 years old.   This is 1882.   This is when he arrives. So he is got kind of dark skin high cheekbones.   He has long hair.   Here you can see ...   Earrings.   He is wearing an elaborate necklace. Looks like it might be made of bone.   And he is wrapped in a blanket.   And then ...   And then here he is in a suit with clean-cut hair.   In the second picture his hair is very short. Not long.   No blanket.   He is wearing a three-piece suit.   Sitting there with a cravat and a spread collar and parted hair.   Wow. It is like in a snapshot you have Tom Indian Tom white man.   Like my Aunt Sophie.   Joe American Horse said his family saw that transformation firsthand.   Aunt Sophie was there in Carlisle for five years and when she came back she looks like a white woman. You know she had a real tiny waist and a bonnet and everything. And she cannot speak Lakota.   She forgot.   Uh-huh.   But just think about this for a second. Just think about this. We spoke with one guy Professor Eric Anderson who teaches at Haskell he is also part Pottawatomi. Just imagine the parents he says the first time they see their kids.   Parents are seeing their students marched around in essentially the uniforms of what had not very long before for many of the tribes been the uniform of the enemy.   At the very least ...   I think that would be startling.   In any case according to Sally Jenkins after the kids were recropped and redressed Pratt would run them through a bunch of drills.   I mean Carlisle was a little military academy. And the Indian kids were so unhealthy at first. They had been put on an unfamiliar diet. They had been sleeping indoors for the first time in their lives and a lot of them were getting sick.   I mean we know that in the 39-year history of the school at least 200 kids died of disease or poor health or even homesickness.   And so Pratt was constantly trying to get the kids outside. And at a certain point he had hired some teachers.   And Sally thinks that one of those hires ...   Probably one of the first dormitory masters.   This guy who had formerly taught at an Ivy League school. He showed the Carlisle Indian kids this game that the kids at Harvard were playing. Maybe he thought it would toughen them up who knows? But suddenly they are playing football. Now keep in mind this is you know at a point we are talking 1882 where football's barely a thing. Not so many schools had teams.   There was not such a thing as a head coach back then. They were volunteer coaches who tended to be students or ex-students.   But the Carlisle kids self-organized level the field start to play. They even start to scrimmage some kids across town. And at one of those games according to Barbara ...   Stacy Matluck who is a Pawnee student at Carlisle later became a Pawnee chief he broke his leg playing football and Pratt said That is it. No more football.   Because in his mind he was trying to civilize these kids and football was doing the opposite. But a short time later says David Adams ...   Approximately three dozen Carlisle boys came into Pratt's office and they said We want to play football.   Do we know what they said exactly?   We do not have -- we do not have the exact words but Pratt says at one point he says Well they stood around my desk. And I am quoting here. Well they stood around my desk their black eyes intensely watching me. He says The orator gave practically all the arguments in favor of our contending in outside football and ended up requesting the removal of the embargo.   According to his memoir Pratt was sort of bowled over by the eloquence and passion of the appeal. So he said Okay ...   You can play if you do these two things. One he says Never slug. People who are looking on will say 'There that is the Indian of it. Just see them. They are savages and you cannot get it out of them.' Okay. And the other one was You have to beat the best teams in America.   And at that early point in American football ...   Far and away the most powerful team was Yale.   Which brings us to October 24th 1896.   It is -- it is a raw fall day in New York.   They played in New York?   Yes at the old Polo Grounds.   Apparently there was about 4000 people in the stands including ...   A handful of newspaper men. New York newspaper men.   Really?   I mean it was a big story.   How did they publicize it? What did they say?   Well the newspapers became incredibly intrigued.     And if you read the newspaper stories they are written as -- they are written in this kind of bloodcurdling shot through with Indian cliches you know?   Here come the Redskins.   Here come the Redskins.   Right right.   According to David Adams in one paper ...   There is a reference to yodeling. The writer said that the fans were yodeling in that Indian fashion.   I mean try to put yourself in the shoes of a New Yorker in the early 1880s. Your contact with an American Indian was in a Wild West Show. It was theater. And here comes a football game and all of these American Indian kids run onto the field. And there is literally an instance in one of the first games where someone in the audience says Well they look just like our boys.   Because of course that is what Pratt wanted. Now one thing that was immediately clear to everyone in attendance when they saw the Carlisle players was that they were physically outmatched.     The impression going in is that it will be an absolute smear job.   Or at the very least the odds are heavily against them. But three minutes into the game in the midst of a big pile up. A Yaley fumbles the ball. It comes squirting out. Carlisle guy picks it up and runs the entire length of the field 63 yards and scores a touchdown. Now nobody had scored on Yale in seven games. They were furious. So what they do is they use their bulk to slowly push the pile down the field twice to take the lead. And with three minutes left Yale is up 12 to 6 Carlisle has the ball. Carlisle running back charges the pile and gets clobbered. Falls backwards And just as he is about to hit the earth he laterals the ball to a teammate who grabs it runs around the scrum the entire length of the field and scores!   Carlisle scores a touchdown that would have tied the game. But it is called back by a referee who was a Yale man.   Why?   The call was that the referee claimed that a whistle had blown. The play dead.   Oh.   And what was the crowd's reaction?   Well they were -- they were furious.   Yes.   There was booing and hooting.   Everyone knew it was a terrible miscarriage of justice.   And some of the Carlisle players said oh we are gonna walk out of here. We are leaving this game. But according to David at the last moment Pratt runs down from the stands comes onto the field and says Wait a second wait a second. Wait. Do not forget rule number one. Be a gentleman.   Pratt did not want this game to end because of their tempers even though they would been wronged by that call.   So the Carlisle boys finish the game. And when they walk off the field ...   They get a standing ovation.   Carlisle wins incredible respect and renown in the aftermath of the game. In fact one of the newspaper men ...   After another Carlisle-Yale game where something similar happened ...   Wrote something to the effect of Carlisle could beat 11 Yale men but they could not beat 11 Yale men and a Yale referee.   Whoa!   Yes. After the Yale game of 1896 Pratt is committed. Pratt believes that it is the greatest thing that can happen to his school. It is an instant way to do what he is been struggling to do for 15 years at the Carlisle school which is to prove the value of these American Indian kids against their white peers.   To prove the value or to quote civilize them?   Well both. To civilize them but also to prove that given education and equal opportunity they were the equal of their -- of their white peers. I mean he was for all of his forcible assimilation methods which were -- remain extremely cruel and destructive he truly believed in the concept of racial equality.   The complicatedness of Pratt and of the whole Carlisle idea kept smacking us in the face as we were putting this show together. I mean on the one hand there were clearly students who felt that Carlisle was prison. And in fact Barbara Landis when she took us on a tour of the grounds of the former Carlisle Indian School she said that kids would even set fire to the buildings.   Yeah some did burn down which is kind of typical on Indian campuses. A lot of fires and burning buildings.   Why?   It is a form of resistance.   On the other hand when we started looking around for original archival recordings of some of the earliest Carlisle players pretty much the only recording we could find ...     Was this oral history with a guy named ...       Albert Exendine. The interview was done in the early '70s when he was 88. He entered the school.         Cannot really play you too much of this because the audio quality is really bad. But in the interview Pratt comes up.     And Exendine talks about him with a great deal of affection and gratitude.     We call him the father of Indian education.     So he is a tough figure Pratt. He is got a very mixed legacy. I mean I like to say Pratt was his country.   Hmm.   Whatever you think of him he was his country.   So okay. So 1896 he gets the bug. Like he sees football's good PR.   Yes.   What happens next?   Well he hires -- he begins looking around for coaches full-time coaches to come in and coach the team. And he winds up with a Cornell grad named Pop Warner. Glenn Pop Warner.   Now Pop Warner was an interesting guy.   Is this Pops right here?   Just to give you a visual.  JAD and  Whoo! Look at him!   Barbara and Cara showed us pictures. Looks kind of like Mike Ditka if Mike Ditka had Einstein's hair.   Pop's a little bit of an outlier. He is got these Texas roots. He is a bit of a rogue. Can be kind of vulgar.   He liked to party a little bit.   He liked to gamble.   Yes.   Really!   And that is exactly what he does in spectacular fashion when he gets to Carlisle.   Because Pop Warner looks at his squad and he realizes that ...   Sure they are fast they got heart.   But they are underweight and they are small.   Way small.   You know while they might occasionally force a tie with a Yale if they you know half killed themselves physically they were not gonna beat the Ivy Leagues on any kind of consistent basis without -- without doing something different. And there was a very fine line between innovation and cheating.    I see.   And Pop Warner starts exploiting that line absolutely as hard as he can. And he comes up with the trick play.   For example 1903.   Pop Warner devises the hidden ball trick.   What is that?   The hidden ball trick is the quarterback takes the ball and actually behind this huge pile of men tucks it under another guy's sweater.   Oh!   While the big pile of men is struggling in the mud in the center of the field not knowing quite where the football is but believing it is somewhere in the middle of the pile here's this kid who squirts around the end with the football hidden under his jersey and he is 30 yards downfield before anybody realizes it.   And how does he keep the ball from falling out of his jersey onto the ground?   I think they actually sewed the jersey so that the ball would stay in there without falling out.   So they made a cheating pocket?   They made a cheating pocket.   Was that legal? Did they got -- did they get a legitimate touchdown?   Was it legal you ask? Pop Warner would have said there was nothing in the rule book against it. Another thing he does which actually works brilliantly is he sews footballs onto the front of their jerseys which were really bulky sweaters at the time. He sews leather football-shaped patches onto the front of their jerseys in order to try to disguise who is got the ball.   Really?   Against Harvard. And the Harvard coach goes insane.   Well I would too! I mean a semi-pregnant player?   That is amazing!   But Harvard did not take this lying down. Harvard retaliates by painting the footballs the same color as their jerseys. It is maroon everywhere. So when they held the ball against their chest the ball basically well you cannot see it.   I mean they all broke the rules. American football is essentially a rule-breaking experience as opposed to British football which did not have referees.   At least initially British football ran on the honor system. But with American football the refs were there practically from the beginning. And she says it was largely a response to the brutality of the game but also to the kind of rule-bending that you saw from Pop Warner and the Carlisle Indians.   Every time Pop Warner came up with an innovation the next year there was a rule against it. So immediately the Ivy League would get together and pass a rule and say Okay no more of that. And that is how the rule book really burgeons in American football. And it is thanks to Pop Warner's slights of hand.   And Pop Warner's greatest sleight of hand and maybe the Carlisle Indians' most soaring moment -- and I mean that literally happened at a moment when the game almost disappeared. That is coming up.                       Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And getting back to our story on the Carlisle Indian School and the birth of the modern game of football. One of the most important moments in this story happens at a time when football it was right on the edge of disappearing. Talking about 1905.   Okay.   This was the most violent year in football to this point. 19 people died on the football field.   19?   One-nine.   One death is a lot. But 19? That is crazy.   Yeah. Because what would happen is that Carlisle would try and do these things to sort of open up the game. The Ivys would consistently respond by making the game more about brute force more about violence. And so you had all these deaths. And suddenly all the major programs were spooked. You know Columbia pulls their -- their football team. Harvard even thinks about doing that.   And so and this is kind of odd. Into the fray steps the President of the United States of America Teddy Roosevelt. Because he was a fan according to Conrad Crane.   He liked football. He liked the manly aspects of it the tough aspects of it. But nobody liked people dying.   And then there was his kid.   His -- his son was playing and getting beat up pretty badly as well.   Broke his nose slit his eyebrow.   In one game he got knocked out cold. So after the violence of '05 the President calls the presidents of all these colleges and so on to Washington. And according to David Adams he basically tells them ...   That the rules had to be rewritten. It had to become a little bit more safe at least or it would be banned.   And out of that we see a couple of rule changes. First the schools decide in order to loosen up the pile so to speak they are gonna tinker with the down yardage ratio.   Instead of going from three downs to gain five yards it becomes three downs to gain 10 yards. The ...   Three downs to get ten yards or four downs to get ten yards?   Four would come a couple years later.   Oh.   But the second rule change which is maybe the most important for our story is for the first time they legalized the ability to move the ball through the free-floating air that surrounds us all. Okay.   So where do we go -- what is the next ...?   So if I could -- if I could place you in a moment unless there is a moment before this you would like to hit. I believe November 23rd 1907.   Yes.   Oh yeah.   Big moment.   Okay. Can you set the scene?   Well the scene from the standpoint of broader American history things have gone airborne.   You mean Wilbur and Orville Wright?   I am talking about not just them but I am talking about hot air balloons. There are aeronautical experiments happening really all over the world. In France everyone is experimenting with flying machines. Things are going up in the air.   But not so fast with football because when the rule committee had made that rule about forward passing they had also hedged a little bit saying if you throw a forward pass and your receiver does not catch it you are penalized 15 yards which back in the day was a monster amount. So nobody threw the ball. It was too risky.   But story goes as soon as that rule got passed Pop Warner goes back to his garage. It is always a garage of course with a ball. And he starts experimenting. And he started thinking okay what would be the most efficient way to toss this thing?   People have to understand that the footballs in those days are not the footballs we have today with the nice whatever the oblate spheroid or whatever they call it with nice points and things. These are rugby balls.   Sort of imagine a deflated basketball.   They are thicker in the middle. They are not as well-shaped. They are really tough to get your hand on to throw right.   And in 1906 there is a tiny bit of tape in Albert Exendine's oral history where he talks about this. In 1906 he says Pop called all the players together. He tells them ...     He says I think you are gonna have to learn to spiral the ball.     Because if you throw the ball on the spiral it gets 10 times less air drag than if you throw it end-over-end.   Plus it is easier to catch.   Yeah.   They start experimenting with it a little bit in 1906 but they come out in 1907 as a throwing offense.   Which gets us to that game. November 23rd 1907 Carlisle plays the University of Chicago. Last game of the season. We are in Chicago. And the Chicago team is arguably the best in the nation.   The best. I do not think it is even arguable.   Well Carlisle's good at this point though.   Yeah. But Chicago's like Stagg Field whoa!   And there are 27000 people in the stands.   Well what happened was the Chicago players had decided to try to defeat Carlisle's innovative forward passing by just knocking the crap out of their receivers every time they came off the line of scrimmage.   And so Carlisle's greatest receiver Albert Exendine our guy had been stymied the entire game because the minute the ball was snapped the Chicago players would ...   Hit him and try to throw him down or knock him out of bounds. So Pop Warner said to Exendine here's what we are gonna do. Next time they hit you out of bounds sneak around the bench and get back on the field.   By some accounts this was Exendine's idea. But whoever thought of it on the next play Albert Exendine as expected ends up out of bounds but he keeps running.   He runs around the back of the bench.   Runs around the spectators maybe around the band.   And comes back on the field.   Right at that moment ...   Hauser the quarterback of Carlisle ...   Lets loose a vicious spiral.   Can I have you read something?   Sure.   Hold on.   This is Sally's description of that moment from her book The Real All Americans.   For a moment it was a frozen scene in a staged drama. The ball hung in the air a tantalizing possibility. Could Exendine reach it? Would he catch it or drop it? Defenders wheeled and stared down field. Spectators watching from the stands found that the breath had died in their collective throats. The spiraling ball seemed to defy physics. What made it stay up? When would it come down? In that long moment 27000 spectators mashed together on benches and crammed on platforms may have felt their loyalty to the home team evaporate in the grip of a powerful new emotion. They may have noticed something they never had before that a ball traveling through space traces a profoundly elegant path. They may have realized something else. That it was beautiful.   The ball struck its human target. Exendine caught the pass all alone and trotted over the Chicago goal line. The stadium exploded in sound and motion. It was the game breaker. The rest was just anti-climax. The final score was 18 to 4 for Carlisle. But the very next year the Ivy League passes a rule that you cannot leave the field and then come back on to it.   Oh that is where that rule came from.   Yes. That is where that rule comes from.   And I have got to say that that description of the ball in the air is -- is timeless in a way.   Beautiful.   That is exactly why football is still beautiful at times.   That is -- that is when -- Carlisle in 1907 is when American football becomes the sport that you watch today.   Oh wow. This is -- is this the field?   This is the field.   This is the field! Can we get out?   Yeah.   After we would spent an entire day looking at pictures of you know Albert Exendine and Pratt and Pop Warner and Delos Lone Wolf and Tom Torlino and all these Carlisle players Barbara and Cara took us to the field where they practiced.   Right. So this is the Carlisle Indian School football field covered in snow. It is like 10 degrees out here. Really really bright sun coming off the snow. And it is just empty.   And we just kind of walked around and tried to imagine all the stuff we would just seen in photos.   It was a little bit like walking among ghosts.   Yeah. That is the sound of the flag blowing in the background. I remember standing on that field and having this thought that I could not quite articulate. But later Eric Anderson that professor from Haskell who is a member of the Pottawatomi Nation he sort of put his finger on it. And essentially said that like there is a lot of room on a football field. I mean there is room for anger and war and violence but there is also room for pride and a kind of coming together that is not a Pratt coming together where one side gets erased but it is a coming together.   Yeah. I mean there is a middle ground. Clearly it is more than a game. The stakes are higher than that. You know will we as Indian people be accepted on our own terms and also in our ability to meet you halfway? Will we be accepted through this as the vehicle? It is clearly more than a game.
