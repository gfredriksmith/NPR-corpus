60    Hey it is Jad. So with the events of the last couple of days by that I mean of course the administration's decision to order a drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport which has unleashed a chain of events that leads we have no idea where. With that happening we wanted to play an episode which I think really puts this situation in a much larger context. We first broadcast this in April of 2014. I am gonna play it for you as we originally put it out and then on the back end we will talk a little bit about how this all relates to the current situation that is unfolding. Again this was originally broadcast in 2014 but it -- it seems to really speak to what is happening right now.     Okay ready? Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   And this is Radiolab.   Today we have got a story about the crazy power of words.   In particular 60 words.   Single sentence.   That is -- well you could say defined America for the last 12 years. And ...     And the place to start is a difficult one.     September 11th 2001. 46 a.m.     This is a day that anyone who is old enough to remember does remember. We can remember where we were who we were with.       And of course we could remember how we felt.         It is the worst attack ever on American soil. But if you really want to understand the world we live in now you have got to jump ahead one day to September 12th to a corner office in the White House where there is a lawyer sitting at a computer trying to figure out how are we going to declare war?   And one of the things that everybody realizes after sort of an initial discussion is yes we would like to declare war but we have no idea upon whom we should declare war.   That is Gregory Johnsen.   The Michael Hastings National Security Reporting Fellow at BuzzFeed.   Now the reason this lawyer ...   Man by the name of Timothy Flanagan.   The reason Flanagan is sitting at a computer in an office is because then President George Bush had to do something. He had to act. And he did not want to act alone. He wanted Congressional approval.   Right.   I mean technically in an emergency ...   The President can defend the country.   He is the Commander-In-Chief after all.   He does not have to go to Congress and say Hey do I have authorization to use force?   Not in an emergency. That is Ben Wittes by the way.   Senior Fellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution.   But President Bush needed Congress on his side he felt. You know it was important that we project unity that we were all standing together as one. And second if this was an act of war ...   The power to declare war in the Constitution is given to Congress not to the Executive.   And when Congress declares war suddenly the President has a very clear and powerful mandate. Now ...   The declaration of war is kind of a dead instrument of international law. I mean nobody's declared war since World War II. But the modern incarnation of the declaration of war is the authorization to use force.   The authorization to use force.   Well it is called the authorization for the use of military force.   Or as it is commonly referred to the AUMF.   Right.   So our lawyer in the White House Flanagan ...   He is given a task.   Go write an AUMF that Congress can send to the President.   He really has no idea so he goes back to the last time that the US did this.   The last time Congress passed one of these things.   He does a quick sort of search on his computer.   Boom. Finds it. 1991 Iraq. The Gulf War. Flanagan grabs the text.   And then he copies that into a Word document and that becomes his template. He makes some cuts he makes some changes he deletes some words.   And then he hits send.       And he sets in motion this bewildering series of events.         This madness that is basically the world we live in.     And if you are like me ...     If you are like me and you find yourself flipping through the channels see the news basically ignoring it. But then every so often thinking Wait a second!         Wait wait. How are we doing this in all these different places?     And like that!     How -- how are we detaining people for so long?   You mean is that -- is it okay to do that?   Well just who signed off on this you know?   Yeah.   And it turns out we all did because it was in that document.   This is the legal foundation for everything that the US has done. Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes to secret renditions to SEAL raids it is all been hung off these 60 words.   And that is the crazy part. The body of this document the part that really matters and the reason that when I was reading Gregory's reporting on this I was like What? Is that it all goes back to one single sentence.   60 words. One sentence.   Can you read it?   Absolutely. That the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations organizations or persons he determines planned authorized committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 2001 or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations organizations or persons.   60 words. Today a collaboration with BuzzFeed.   And with reporter Gregory Johnsen.   We are going to try to decode those words.   And ask where do those words come from? And how did they come to mean what they mean?   Which is not what you would think they would mean.   No.   And how did they end up leading us into what is arguably the longest war in American history?   And nobody saw it coming. Absolutely nobody. That is the weirdest part.   Well ... nobody minus one. Let us start there.   Maybe you should introduce us to Barbara Lee.   Right. Barbara Lee is a congresswoman from right around Berkeley California.   Hello?   Hello hello.   Hi it is Barbara.   And she is someone who has been in many ways a lifelong activist.   Going all the way back to when she was 15 in high school in San Fernando Valley.   Because I wanted to be a cheerleader.   But you know since this was the early '60s.   You had to have certain criteria like at least whether it was stated or not blonde and blue-eyed.   That would have been hard for you I would figure.   That was really hard. So I went to the NAACP.   She got them to pressure the school to change the rules.   And I won.   And she became the first Black cheerleader at her high school.   Yeah. Yeah.   That is just by way of introduction. Fast forward many years she becomes a congresswoman. She gets elected to a second term. And on that day ...     She was at the Capitol.   No one knew where to go so the police officers just said Run run run. Go go go.     So I ran out of the Capitol.   Wow!   Down Pennsylvania Avenue. I remember looking back and saw a lot of smoke.   Which was you know the Pentagon.   You know clearly the country's under attack. Clearly people have died. Clearly we have got to deal with whoever did this. Whatever it takes.   Fast forward two days September 13th. Barbara Lee is back at the Capitol to meet with her Democratic colleagues to review that document that Flanagan had sent over.   The mood in the room was very somber and very angry ...   The thing we have to keep in mind when we are talking about this is all of this was done within 72 hours after the worst terrorist attack in United States history.   ... and very confused. What would be the appropriate response?   So as she and her colleagues read those 60 words ...   There was a lot of debate going on back and forth.   Oh yes. Oh yes. From everyone.   Because this actually was not the first draft. Flanagan had sent one over the night before.   September 12 2001.   And that one ...   Was something that almost no one agreed to.   According to Gregory that early draft had a few extra lines in it.   One gave the President the power to preempt any future acts of aggression against the United States.   And Barbara Lee and her colleagues knew ...   That look so many things can be packed into this word aggression that if we sign on to this that if we give the President this power the President may never have to come back to Congress ever again and request authorization for military force because he can say that anything is aggression. And we are also giving him the power to preempt.   So they kicked it back to the White House. Flanagan took out those words and now they had this new draft.   That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force ...   Which is what you heard. But still when Barbara read that and saw phrases like All necessary and appropriate force she thought What does that even mean?   I said this is too broad. It is not definitive. It is open-ended.   And as she was speaking -- this is taking place in the basement of the Capitol Building -- she sees some of her Democratic colleagues start to nod.   Yeah. People were nodding. People were nodding.   Because everybody there knew the danger of ill-defined words. You just had to go back 50 years ...   To the Gulf of Tonkin.   Yep.   Gulf of Tompkin.   Tonkin.   Tonkin. Tonkin with an N.   Yes.   To explain ...     1964 LBJ announces that two American ships ...     Parked in the Gulf of Tonkin off the coast of Vietnam were torpedoed by North Vietnamese boats.     Many people now argue that one of these attacks never even happened. Nonetheless President Johnson wanted to strike back so he asked Congress ...     Which they did. Giving him the power to quote Take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the United States and to prevent further aggression.     Now it is the broad language of that document most people believe that opened the door to the worst part of the Vietnam War.     The thousands and thousands of casualties.     Horrific atrocities.     And in a television interview in 1969 when President Johnson was asked to justify it all he said you cannot just blame him.     So the lessons of Gulf of Tonkin and Vietnam that was very much in the air in that meeting on September 13th 2001.     So it was understandable that when Barbara Lee stood up and said to her colleagues she was worried about some of this language ...   People were nodding. People were nodding. So there was a lot of uncertainty about what to do.   But in the end those concerns were ultimately outweighed by another desire.   We have got to be unified with the President. We cannot show political divisions.   Let us have the nation let us have Congress speaking with one voice.   It was a time for unity and for action. And so walking out of that Democratic Caucus meeting ...   On the evening of September 13th.   Congressional leadership decided that these 60 words ...   This is the version. There is no going back to the drawing board. And so at 16 am September 14 2001 ...     The Senate is gaveled into session.     Daschle calls a vote.     There are 98 senators on the floor.     All 98 of them vote yay.     So it was a sweep.   Yeah.   Later in the day the resolution would go to the House where Barbara Lee was a representative. Daschle had actually rushed the vote through the Senate ...   Because the White House has called for a national prayer meeting at the National Cathedral ...   For the victims of 911.   ... that is supposed to start right at noon. And so ...   Right after the vote ...   ... all the Senators pour out of the Capitol and get onto the buses trying to get through the drizzle.   It was actually raining that day. Now at that moment Barbara Lee ...   She had not decided how it is that she was gonna vote.   I struggled with it.   For the previous two nights September 12th and 13th she would stayed up late.   Calling back to advisors to friends in California.   We talked every day.   Including this guy. This is Ron Dellums.   I served for over 27 years in the U.S. House of Representatives.   Barbara used to be his chief of staff and when he resigned she won his congressional seat.   You know she would say Well what about this? And what do you think about that?   And we kind of talked through the emotional state of the country.   That we are feeling pain anger. We are shocked.   Both Barbara and Ron were trained as psychiatric social workers so they both knew that when a person is feeling all of those things it is generally better to do nothing.   Yes. Psychology 101. You do not make decisions when you are mourning afraid.   On the other hand ...   I believe you know in unity too. I want to be unified with the President when the country's under attack.   I understood.   He did not tell me. He did not say which way I should vote.   But I did say to her Barbara however you vote I will always respect you you will always be a friend. You will always be family.   So at that moment with the memorial service about to start and a few hours until the House vote Barbara Lee was at the Capitol.   I was in the cloakroom.   And since she was not sure how she was gonna vote she planned to skip the memorial service.   She wanted to stay she wanted to think.   And then I do not know what it was it may have been the spirit moving me I do not know. But at the very last minute ...   She was drinking actually a can of ginger ale at the time.   I said I think I am gonna go. And I just ran out. I probably was the last one on the bus. I had the can of ginger ale in my hand and ran down the steps and got on the bus.   She got to the cathedral. The house buses arrived about 30 minutes or so before the opening. And so for 30 minutes she is in the cathedral.   About halfway back.   listening to the organ.   Thinking about the families and those who were killed.   There are people around her who are sort of whispering.   The pain and anguish.   The few people who are crying.   Well I said I gotta pray over this.   And she is just wrestling with her vote. Her heart is saying one thing.   This is too broad.   And her head is saying ...   Unity.   How is it that you can be against the President at this point?   Speaking of the president eventually President Bush takes the podium.     And then as soon as President Bush steps down everyone in the congregation stands up. And they sing The Battle Hymn of the Republic which is a very powerful a very moving piece of music but it is not the sort of thing that is typically sung at a memorial service. It is a very forward and almost aggressive sounding.   What is the phrase? Terrible swift sword.   Yeah.   Oh my God it was not quite what I expected in a memorial service.   But the second speaker ...   A Reverend by the name of Nathan Baxter.   Got up and he gave a reading from Jeremiah 31.     Hearing that all over again takes me right back there. And I remember ...     Lamenting and bitter weeping.     Rachel weeping for her children.     When he spoke that is when to me it was a memorial.   And then he -- he started to pray.     And he said something that really struck Barbara Lee.     He said As we act ...     That evil that we deplore. When he said that I became very -- it was this sense of peace and calm came over me.   And Barbara Lee says it was right then that she knew what she would do.       Later that evening the House opens up its debate on the AUMF.     And Congressperson after Congressperson ...     Stands up.       One after another.         16 in a row. Until ...     We get to Barbara Lee.     Just after the vote Barbara Lee says she was in the cloak room again and she starts getting accosted by colleagues.   All of these friends are coming up to her and saying You have got to go back. You -- you cannot vote this way.   I said I am not changing my vote.   One of them actually said to her Look you have done so much on HIV you have done so much on AIDS. This vote is gonna take you out. Think of the bigger picture.   They are saying You are dead.   Yeah.   But that is the right vote. I am not gonna give any president the authority to go to war when we do not know what we are doing. You know only Congress can declare a war.     The final vote for the House was 420 to one.     Barbara Lee was the only person in the Senate or the House to cast a No vote.   That must have been a very lonely moment.   To be perfectly honest with you I said some prayers for my friend.   This was the right thing to do. And you know votes like this you have to be ready to pay the consequences.   Over the next few weeks and months ...   Her office was inundated with letters.     You can find all these letters archived at Mills College.     So much hatred.     Those attacks came and they came and they came. Death threats.     And so I had to have security day and night.         If you go to Mills College in Oakland and we sent reporter there you will find 60000 letters. They are not all negative but most are. But Congressman Lee says she never faltered because right after the vote when she was in her office.   My dad called me. Lieutenant Colonel retired in the Army. He said I am really proud of you.   Huh.   You know and my dad had been in Korea and World War II. And he -- he sees it the way I see it because I really was not sure what he was saying because -- you know I really was not sure.   She thought All right.   Daddy's proud of me.   Now we should note that Barbara Lee is still a Congresswoman. She did not pay the price for that No vote. And whatever you think of her vote whether you think it was the right thing to do or the wrong thing to do what is interesting to me is that as we are sitting here looking back on 12 years of war she was sitting there 12 years ago looking forward. And maybe she saw something about how this would play out. About how these -- these words these 60 words would start to grow and expand. That is next.                 Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today ...   60 Words.   This is a collaboration with BuzzFeed and reporter Gregory Johnsen. The story is based on a -- an article that Gregory wrote about the 60 simple words that have really defined American counterterrorism for more than a decade.   It is called the authorization for use of military force. That is shortened to AUMF and it was passed by Congress three days after September 11th. Here it is again read by Senator John McCain.     All right. So why would we be looking at that boring-ass sentence?   He seems almost bored saying it.   Yeah he does. Can I just be honest with you for a second?   Yeah.   I generally move through the world with the assumption -- which is -- which has been proven over and over again to be true -- that I do not know how the world works. Like somehow I missed that day in school or something.   Are you referring to something specific? Like a ...   No I am referring to a general sense that somehow like Oz is out there behind the curtain pulling levers and I am just always going to be stuck on this side you know?   Yeah.   I think it is what motivates the show for me is that like I just -- I feel kind of stupid most of the time and these shows are a way to engage the world and really examine the world.   Right. Exactly.   And when it comes to these matters of national security I really feel clueless. And so when I read Gregory's article I felt like I understood something crucial for the first time about the way words actually operate in the world. Because like again this sentence this totally boring sentence?   This is the legal foundation for everything that the US has done. Everything from Guantanamo Bay to drone strikes to secret renditions to SEAL raids it is all been hung off these 60 words. One lawyer who was in the Bush Administration said Look this sentence is like a Christmas tree. All sorts of things have been hung off of this.   But how? How -- like because you read the thing and you do not see any mention of Guantanamo Bay in those 60 words.   It does not mention detention. It does not mention drone strikes. It does not mention drone strikes against American citizens.   Okay so that guy he was one of the first folks we called to help us decode this. That is -- that is John Bellinger.   I served as the legal adviser for the National Security Council from 2001 to 2005 and as the legal adviser for the Department of State from 2005 to 2009.   You cannot do any speed dating with -- with a credential like that because the date will be over.   That is my congressional testimony voice.   And we asked him like Okay so detention is not anywhere in this document. So how do you read detention from these 60 words?   The argument with which I am comfortable as a legal matter ...   Is this. He says if you go eight words into those 60 words ...   Mm-hmm.   And you get to the phrase ...   All necessary and appropriate force ...   All necessary and appropriate force. Yeah.   You gotta ask yourself What is force? What does that mean?   What do you -- you know what force is. If I punch you in the face that is using force.   That is one kind of force.   You can use force to kill people.   Yes.   But a lesser use of force is to detain them. Detention is simply lesser included in the use of force that comes naturally in a military operation.   It is like a subset of force basically. So if you are authorized to use force to kill people you are also by default authorized to use force to detain them.   Essentially to knock them out of the battle in other ways. And that that force is both necessary and it is appropriate. And the courts have upheld that.   So that one word force that is how you justify Guantanamo Bay.     The Authorization to Use Military Force Act has ...     ... been the legal basis for the detention of thousands of individuals.     And the words 'detention' are never mentioned.   Okay so that is detention. It gets even trickier if you go just a few words past 'all necessary and appropriate force.'   To what?   You get to the mention of the enemy. Who the force is supposed to be used against right? And it seems to be very limited language.   You mean we cannot shoot everybody or anybody.   No. Only the people who ...     That sounds much more ...   It sounds very much tethered to 911 right?   Yeah.   Which is why a lot of congressmen and women voted for it. Joe Biden on the day of the vote September 14th 2001 he says Look people do not freak out about this language.     Because we are just talking about Al-Qaeda who did this and the Taliban who have harbored them right?   No.   Not necessarily.   Gregory Johnsen again.   Over time what is happened is there is been this other sort of catch-all category that has been read into these 60 words even though it appears nowhere in these 60 words. And that catch-all category is associated forces.   Associated forces?   Yeah.   What we have been calling the 61st and 62nd words.   Soixante-et-un et soixante-deux.   Oui oui. And if you define the enemy as Al-Qaeda the Taliban and associated forces it is a whole different ball game.   Yeah.   So when you read those -- those -- all those words it did not include the phrase ...   Associated forces is nowhere in the text.   So where does it ...?   So then why could people cite something that is not in the text?   This is one of the enduring mysteries of this. So ...   The earliest example that we could find of those two words is in a 2004 memo from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. He defines the enemy as Al-Qaeda the Taliban and associated forces. But the truth is it may have just been there from the beginning.   What do you mean?   Because according to Ben Wittes from The Brookings Institution ...   There is a concept in the laws of war called co-belligerency. It is the idea that if you are at war with person A and person B is on person A's side in the war you are also legally at war with person B.   Makes perfect sense if you think of it in traditional war terms because like we are at war with Germany. Italy joins their side. So by default we are at war with Italy too.   Right.   So just transpose that here. If we are at war with this group called Al-Qaeda ...   And a certain set of groups ...   That are not them.   Join the war.   On Al-Qaeda's side ...   Then you are legally at war with them.   If you do not think about that too hard it is crystal clear.   But then the question that has arisen over time is how broad do you make that -- that circle?   Because the problem obviously is that we are not talking about nation-states anymore. We are talking about groups.   So okay how close does the link to Al-Qaeda and the people who carried out September 11th have to be? So if you have someone who is connected to someone who is connected to someone who is connected to someone who was connected to September 11 is that enough? Or is it only three links? Or can you be an associate of an associate?   Now we cannot exactly know how broadly the Obama and Bush administrations have defined those words. And we will talk about why in a second.   Uh-huh.   But you just have to look at the news.   Right.   And you could see that like we started with a war that was in Afghanistan and then it spread to a lot of different places Pakistan Libya Somalia.   Yemen.   Yeah and in Yemen ...   There is a lot of debate and a lot of discussion.   About like is this legal? Does this have anything to do with September 11th anymore?   Because now the group in Yemen Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula which is a group that -- that was first formed in 2009 they have their own hierarchy and their own structure. And it is not clear how and in what fashion they take orders from either Osama Bin Laden while he was still alive or now Ayman al-Zawahiri. So does this make them an associated force or does it make them part of Al-Qaeda?   The answer at least on ...     September 30th 2011 seemed to be yes when the U.S. assassinated two members of the group.     And to put all this in context between 2002 and 2014 according to some estimates there have been about 65 drone strikes in Yemen killing about 400 people. And so much hinges on how you define those words.   So much is in the definition. I asked the Pentagon. I said Who -- what are the list of associated forces? So Al-Qaeda yes. The U.S. is at war that is clear. What about the other groups?   Al-Shabaab Al-Qaeda in Iraq Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb Armed Islamic Group Abu Sayyaf Jemaah Islamiyah Brotherhood of this Brotherhood of that.   Who -- who are these groups? Who is the U.S. at war with? And the Pentagon emailed me back and they said That list is classified and not for public release.   Wait. So we -- who we are at war with is ...   We do not know. I ...   Wait. So you are saying when you approached the Pentagon ...   They say that they will not tell you the names of the people were at war against. Well maybe they should not. Maybe that is a valuable ...   What do you mean?   Well ...   Do not you want to know as a citizen of America who were fighting?   On the other hand do I want to know as the -- if the United States has determined that I am dangerous to it if it announces then that would give me a certain amount of notice which I may -- perhaps would be disadvantageous to the United States.   It could also though act as a disincentive for you to take action.   Maybe. But maybe not. Maybe they will just get quieter and more dangerous.   I mean it is true there might be reasons for this.   They have not wanted to provide a public list because they ...   This is John Bellinger again.   One the groups move all the time. And so if you say Well these are associated groups well then certain people just move from group A to Group B. And they also want to leave these different groups guessing. But it still raises democratic concerns if the American people do not really know who the executive branch believes is covered by the AUMF.   In a democracy and in a representative democracy that has to be weighed out. Should the citizens of the United States know who it is that the United States is targeting for death around the world? Who it is that the United States is technically at war with? Should war be a decision that the citizens of a democracy of a representative democracy have a say in?   Well we are a representative democracy as you just said. So I am assuming that the Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee knows every item on that list.   I am not so sure.     One of the more interesting Senate hearings took place in early 2013.     It was the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan is the Chairman of the committee. Senator McCain is on the committee.     And Gregory says the senators called a couple of Defense Department officials to answer questions.     Because they wanted to know like now that we are 12 years into this war how are you using this document? Does need to be changed?   So the Department of Defense officials and there were four of them came and said Look ...     Do not revisit this sentence do not repeal it. This sentence is sufficient. It gives us all the power that we need.     And as they are laying out their case they say those two words ...         Over ...     ... and over.               And then instead of just nodding along a lot of the senators were like What?     That is Angus King independent senator from Maine.     But one of the most striking moments of this hearing is when the head of the committee Senator Carl Levin turns to one of the DoD officials and asks him ...                 Let me just see if I can understand what you just said. At a Committee hearing ...   Yeah.   A U.S. Senator asks specifically so who is on the list of people we are allowed to kill?   Right. That suggested that the Senate Armed Services Committee who had oversight really had no idea.   Which made us wonder like all right if we do not have any idea who we are at war with and the Senate Armed Services Committee does not seem to have any idea then who does?   Well one of the things that became clear to me as I was reporting on this story was that many of the people who are making these decisions had never been elected by anyone to any position and they were the ones who are making the decision not the elected representative.   And so who are they?   So we were rooting around for a while looking for an answer to that question until we found this guy. This is Daniel Klaidman he is a journalist.   And I have covered national security and counterterrorism for many years.   And based on hundreds of confidential interviews that became his book Kill Or Capture he was able to paint a picture for us of who makes these decisions and how. He told us about these meetings.   You say it is the STVS meetings. What are they? Who is in the room? How do the events unfold?   Well these are -- they call them SVTS meetings. In the vernacular of the bureaucracy it stands for Secure Video Teleconference Meetings.   He described them as a sort of a massive top-secret Google Hangout chat where ...   Literally hundreds of people from throughout the national security bureaucracy ...   Log in to decide who is on the list and who is not and who should live and who should die.   You said literally hundreds?   Literally hundreds of people. Now many of them are backbenchers. They are not participating in the call but they are taking notes. Before they get together in this meeting ...   Many of the folks at this meeting he says are given a little packets of information on each target.   They call them baseball cards.   Because they sort of look like it. You got a picture and some stats.   Like Yogi Berra on one side and then you got his batting average and his hometown on the back.   Well the terrorist equivalent of all of that. So who is this person? Where does he rank and what kinds of operations has he been involved in in the past?   Eventually a general will come on the screen and say Here's our target.   Objective Akron.   For some reason he says they always refer to the targets by the name of American cities.   Objective Toledo.   A general might say Target is in Yemen. We have a drone overhead.   There is an opportunity to kill this person.   Can we legally do it? And the fascinating thing although maybe it will not come as much of a surprise is that the people he is making this pitch to are not generals but ...   Lawyers.   There are lawyers everywhere.   That is just a basic fact of modern warfare says John Bellinger. You now have lawyers on the ground ...   With artillery units tank commanders.   Lawyers in Kevlar lawyers in helicopters.   There are lawyers really almost behind every bomb.   There is just lawyers everywhere?   Yeah and that is a very good thing.   That is Harold Koh. He was the top lawyer at the State Department from 2009 to 2013.   Because it means that we are not just shooting away at people willy-nilly or because we are angry at them or anything. It is a considered careful decision.   Now Harold Koh according to Dan Klaidman's reporting was in those SVTS meetings and he would often be the one to answer the generals' questions. Can we legally kill this person? So we asked him like if lawyers are now the ones deciding who we are at war with and who we are not how do you do it? And unfortunately for us ...   I do not think I can get into that on this call. There are multiple methods but I am not gonna go into that.   He said he could not comment on any of it because it is classified. But ...   Harold Koh is a creative lawyer ...   According to Dan Klaidman who spoke with a lot of people familiar with the process Koh in particular had a fascinating way of determining who is and is not an associated force. In other words who we are or are not at war with. And it seems to be less about the groups as a whole and more about individuals within the group. For example ...   Seniority. That was an important issue.   For Koh if you are gonna target a guy he has to be a senior member of a group like Al-Qaeda.   Right.   He has to be able to give orders. And he has to be unique within the organization.   You could not simply under Harold Koh's theory go after say a driver or a cook who was in Al-Qaeda or even foot soldiers because they were fungible.   Meaning they could be easily replaced.   Another criteria was whether they were externally-oriented.   For Koh if they were just participants in a civil war you could not target them but if they were targeting Westerners or Western interests then yes. So if you take Dan Klaidman's account of Harold Koh's criteria as representative and we personally have no way of verifying it but if you take that as the norm then maybe there is a strong vetting process in place.   But I interviewed numerous people who participated in these meetings and one of the things that I heard over and over again was that there was this kind of inexorable momentum toward killing and that the military people in these meetings could speak with a kind of a tone of do-or-die urgency. In fact two of the people who I quote in my book used exactly the same metaphor to describe that sense of momentum that was very difficult to resist. It was like standing on a train track with a train hurtling toward them at a hundred miles an hour.   Then I guess like the -- the important question for me is like how often do they say no?   Well ...   If the answer had been 99 times yes and one time no? Or 50 times yes and 50 times no?   Yeah.   How many nos are there?   Well look I would say -- I did not come across many many examples ...   But he did tell us about this one instance.   This was a meeting between the top lawyer at the Defense Department a man named Jeh Johnson and the top lawyer at the State Department who was then ...   Harold Koh!   Harold Koh.   And according to Dan's sources Harold Koh and Jeh Johnson were faced with determining the fate of a 40-year-old man roughly 40 named ...   Sheikh Mukhtar Robow. I think that is the right way to say his name. I am not sure.   He was a member of the Somali group Al-Shabaab. And for context ...     A few months before this conversation this is in 2010 Al-Shabaab bombed a rugby club and a restaurant at the same time in Uganda killing 74 people.     So that had just happened. And according to Dan Klaidman at this moment in intelligence circles there was a debate raging as to whether Al-Shabaab should or should not be considered an associated force.   At the time their leader had sworn allegiance to Osama Bin Laden but their agenda was primarily a local agenda. They had never struck out against the United States or against American interests in the region.   So you have got the top lawyer at the State Department and the top lawyer at the Pentagon facing off as to whether this fellow Robow from Al-Shabaab should live or die.   And how does this work? Does somebody just like -- does someone pound the table? Or ...   Yes. This was -- this was a very heated meeting. Jeh Johnson argued vehemently that Robow was covered under the AUMF.   He was after all a founding member of Al-Shabaab.   Harold Koh vehemently disagreed. Harold Koh's conclusion based on the evidence and the intelligence that he saw ...   Was that Robow was not externally-focused. In fact he belonged to a faction of Al-Shabaab ...   That was arguing against attacking the United States and other Western interests.   So according to Klaidman these two men went back and forth and back and forth until eventually Harold Koh just drew a hard line and essentially said ...   Look if you do this you need to know that you will be doing it over the unambiguous objections of the State Department's legal adviser.   The unambiguous -- ooh!   And that is very strong language coming from a lawyer. And the signal that is sent to the White House was you will be taking military action even though the top lawyer of the State Department said that this would be an illegal action.   Okay so what happened? Did they decide not to?   They did not do it.   This is not academic. It is -- it is -- lives depend on which way the decision goes.   We will continue in a moment.     Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab.   Today We have devoted the entire -- we are continuing to devote the entire show to a single sentence. One sentence.   60 words.   That is all.   It is the 2001 authorization to use military force. It was signed into law on September 18 2001. And together with BuzzFeed and reporter Gregory Johnsen we have -- we have manhandled these words.   Yeah we have dissected we have bisected.   Trisected.   And whatever other kind of sected you could do.   Quadrasected.   To the AUMF as its called.   Yes. And you know we have looked at how the sentence has defined our last 12 years of counterterrorism.   And now?   How will it define our future?     So when we were thinking about that Senate Armed Services Committee hearing we ended up calling someone who sat on the committee.   Tim Kaine Senator from Virginia.   And who was there that day.   Yeah that was a -- that was a very kind of hair-raising day.   And Senator Kaine told us that one of the most hair-raising moments for him was when one of his fellow Senators Lindsey Graham asked one of the Department of Defense officials ...     In other words ...   How long do you think this particular war as declared in this section is going to go on?         It was chilling.   Because like this is already ...   The longest war in the history of the United States.   Longer than Vietnam. And now a DoD official is saying add on 10 or 20 years?   So I said ...     You tell me if -- if somebody is born ...     Let us imagine in 2030 ...   They join a group that has just become associated with Al-Qaeda.  In 2030!     And without hesitation the administration witnesses said Yes.     It is not limited in time not limited in geography. Really troubling. But you know I am also troubled by another thing. I mean you know the iconic -- it is a New York picture of the V-J Day kiss in Times Square.   Yeah.     August 14th 1945.   There ought to be a day where those who have served in war that you declare that the war is over and then you celebrate them.       Do you get asked sometimes by service families like when is this gonna end? Does it ever come up?   Yes. Yes. Yes.   He told us that something like one in three people in his state of Virginia are connected to the military. So he does get that question a lot. And the truth is we all want a V-J Day. We need it. And so seven days after that Senate Armed Services Committee hearing President Obama ...     Gave a speech.     Where he seems to say basically it is time.     He basically announces that he would like to get rid of those 60 words and end this war.   Yeah.   But common sense tells you that these are different kind of enemy not a state or a government. They just sort of -- they make war in a different way.   Senator McCain has a great line. He goes look we are in an age of warfare where the war is not gonna end with the signing of a peace treaty on the deck of a destroyer. That is not how it happens these days. There is no clear start and ending.   And yet the president ...   He wants to end the war.   Says Ben Wittes.     He sees himself as a person who came in to a country fighting two wars and he brought them all to an end. And I think he wants to have done that.   But how -- how do you -- how do you do that? How do you end a war when the vast amount of people that you are calling the enemy have not stopped fighting?   So what he does in the May speech and it is extremely clever. And by the way it is really well-lawyered is he announces a set of rules going forward for drone strikes.     That he is only gonna use drone strikes when there is an imminent threat.   And it is well understood by people who understand this kind of stuff that in the Constitution and also in international law the President is allowed to act unilaterally in self-defense when there is an imminent threat. Meaning it is urgent and you cannot feasibly capture that person. Ben fears that what President Obama was doing there by stressing that word ...     Is that he was laying a new foundation. He was saying when the AUMF ends and I want it to end I do have another way of justifying all these things.   Maybe they would not change.   So the drone strikes and the raids would continue.   As long as you have a capacious enough understanding of what the word imminent means you might be able to continue a whole lot of this stuff. And then you do not have to go to Congress at all. And you can say you have ended the war. And the human rights groups will cheer for you. And we are gonna mysteriously find that there are a whole lot of imminent threats ...     And in the context of what happened to those 60 words you do have to wonder what is gonna happen to a word like imminent? And all the while according to Ben Wittes and pretty much everyone we spoke with we have not really answered the big questions.   When do we want to attack the enemy? Who is the enemy?   And if we are gonna be fighting them even when we are not technically at war with them then what is the difference between war and peace?   And that is why this whole subject is so unsettling. Like if you do not know the common sense definition anymore of when you are at war and when you are at peace then how do you -- how do you write rules?   Okay so we -- I am gonna cut in here. We produced that episode in April of 2014 and as I mentioned at the top of the episode this -- the reason this came to mind for us now the reason we decided to re-release this podcast is -- is what happened four days ago. A U.S. drone strike killed the head of Iran's Quds Forces Qassim Suleimani. He was at the Baghdad International Airport. The assassination if you want to call it that people debate whether you should call it that it seems pretty clear to me that is what it was that has set off a chain of events that we have no idea where it is gonna lead. But it did raise a basic question for us which is how is the United States government justifying this? Is this an AUMF-type situation or has that been phased out? And are we seeing what Benjamin Wittes was worrying about more than five years ago that it is some kind of imminent threat-type justification? Just raised a lot of questions for us. And so ...   Hello hello.   How are you doing?   Hey!   We got Benjamin Wittes back on the line to give us his take. He is a Senior Editor at the Brookings Institution Editor-In-Chief at the blog Lawfare. He had a bit of a cold. The first thing that he told us is that even though Obama -- President Obama pledged to get rid of the AUMF in that clip that we played in the episode it is still very much here very much in effect.   It is still doing a lot of work. It was the basis for the anti-ISIS campaign or one of the bases for the anti-ISIS campaign. It remains the basis for a variety of overseas counter-terrorism operations. It remains the legal basis for a whole lot of detention operations including Guantanamo Bay. It is also the case that we have started to confront a variety of issues in which the -- even the endlessly stretchy and elastic AUMF does not obviously get you to. One of them for example is Iranian-backed militias in -- in Iraq. These are not in any sense associated forces of Al-Qaeda.   And so what the Trump administration has done he says -- and by the way they were not the first to do this -- they have taken that stretchy AUMF from 2001 and they have added things to it to make it even stretchier. Namely they have begun to call upon this whole collection of loose unidentified powers that the Constitution gives a President in order to protect the United States.   According to the Wall Street Journal the Pentagon was careful not to say imminent in its statement about the killing of Suleimani. What did they say if not that?   Let me pull the statement because I think the statement is interesting and worth parsing. Statement ... Suleimani ... okay. So it is a three-paragraph statement. The first paragraph reads At the direction of the President the U.S. Military has taken decisive defensive action to protect US personnel abroad by killing Qassim Suleimani the head of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Quds Force a U.S-designated foreign terrorist organization. So the key words there are decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad right? And so that is invoking the idea of pre-emptive self-defense right? We -- we believe he was going to attack U.S. forces or personnel abroad so we took action to neutralize that threat. The second paragraph General Suleimani was actively developing plans to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region. Suleimani and his Quds Force were responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American and coalition service members and the wounding of thousands more. So there you have situating the current threat claim against a past pattern and practice of a robust series of attacks that in fact killed a lot of such people.   Then the next sentence is He had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months including the attack on December 27th culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel. General Suleimani also approved the attacks on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that took place this week. So now we are talking about contemporary activity.   All of which sounds -- although it never really says it outright -- that there was some kind of imminent threat that needed to be dealt with.   But then the statement throws you a curveball because the last paragraph reads This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans. The United States will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and interests wherever they are in the world. Now deterrence is not a imminent threat issue right? Like -- and so the implication there is we are trying to send them a message. And that is a very different theory. And so I do not actually know how to read the totality of that statement. It seems to say it invokes -- it is suggestive of imminence without saying it. It suggests that the fundamental theory is a force protection theory. And then it also shifts gears and talks about deterrence which strikes me as sounding in a completely different set of values. And so I found the statement pretty confusing to be honest.   It sounds like a sort of the legal version of a Choose Your Own Adventure in a way.   That is exactly right. So it is a little bit of Choose Your Own Adventure but it is also perhaps more importantly it is we need all the adventures in order to -- because if you just rely on the self-defense and troop defense thing then the question becomes well what are the troops even doing there right? You need the AUMFs to get the troops there in the first place.   Wow so what you -- what you were worried about back in 2014 about like this drift that would happen where the AUMF would get stretched but then also things would get layered onto it to where it is impossible to know the borders anymore of who is our actual enemy and who is not and what even is war in this context?   Yeah that is exactly right. And this is not a Trump thing. It started in the Bush Administration. It accelerated in the Obama Administration and it continues now. The Executive hordes war powers. On the other hand Congress deserves a great deal of the blame here. Members individual members -- and Senator Tim Kaine deserves a real shout out here -- have tried to assert a kind of principled limits on allowing this drift to take place but the actual posture institutionally of Congress is it does not push back against these theories it does not clarify the law. And that constitutes acceptance of these statutes that are meant for very different purposes being understood as authorizing these activities that they are kind of jerry-rigged to support. And the Suleimani case is a really good example of this. It is a kind of a crazy expansion of what I had thought the parameters of our legal fight against terrorism looked like. And to have it done on a Donald Trump temper tantrum without a sort of meaningful Congressional involvement strikes me as democratically baffling.   We expect things will likely change pretty rapidly and we will do our best to update this episode as -- as they do. Huge thanks this hour to BuzzFeed and to their reporter Gregory Johnsen.
