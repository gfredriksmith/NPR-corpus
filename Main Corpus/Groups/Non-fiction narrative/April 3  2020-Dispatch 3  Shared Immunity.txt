  Listener supported WNYC Studios.     Do do do do do do. Molly Webster.   I wonder how long it will ring for.    Hey.   Hi.   It rings for an awful long time before it makes ...    How do I sound?   You sound amazing.   Okay great. Cause I am in quite a contrived setup right now but.   Are you in your closet under a blanket?   Yeah. Got a desk mic from the station after my mic that I ordered got stolen off my front porch. I want to do one thing. Im going to take off my hat. Give me a second. Mic down. Take off the...   Im Jad Abrumad. This is RadioLab. That voice of course is Molly Webster. This is Dispatch 3 which has to do with a bit of science that I feel really captures the spirit of this moment. On so many levels. Were going to tell you about that. And then second were going to play you an interview that  really kind of knocked us all on our butts.   Great ok. So Im recording on this end so weve got a back up.   All right Webster. Are you -- did you get your two-hour PhD?     Do you mean my 35-minute PhD?   Okay. So where in the cluster -- where in the just helter skelter mayhem of the last two weeks did you bump into this idea?   It was thinking about treatments basically. Because like the holy grail that everyone keeps talking about is a vaccine. And thinking about how that vaccine you know the estimates are 12 to 18 months. And even in vaccine-land that is pretty generous like as far as a fast timescale goes. So like what happens in the interim time? There are options on the table where they are like Hey there is this drug that we have seen in the lab do well against coronaviruses in mice. Maybe we grab that drug and we try it here. They are repurposing like rheumatoid arthritis drug treatments and they are repurposing drugs that they tried in the Ebola crisis but did not work but maybe they will work here...   Right.   So there is actual stuff like that happening. But the thing that jumped out at me the most probably because of its like immediacy and the potential for like now -- of using it now is blood transfusions.   Blood transfusions.    I do not even know what that means right?   Right. What does that mean?   Because it has one more word in it. Its blood plasma transfusions. So suddenly youre like what is a blood transfusion? And then like whats plasma?   Maybe this is something youve seen mentioned in the press in the past couple of days. To my mind when I hear the words blood transfusion I think of those medical drawings from the 1600s where you see a tube running from one persons arm directly into another persons arm. The idea in this case in brief is that were you know standing in this tragic gap right this is what I talked about in the last dispatch. We know a little bit about this virus but not nearly enough to be able to fight it effectively. And we need to do something now. All the while we do notice this difference that some people on their own seem to fight off the virus just fine. They have very mild symptoms. Others get very very sick. We dont yet understand why theres that difference. But maybe we could use it.   The thought is okay if theres a coronavirus person -- if theres someone who had coronavirus and they survived. They survived because of some reason. Like their body did something well and scared off this virus and crushed it and they lived. And so maybe if we tap into that body as a resource and take from it the thing the part of it that fights of viruses -- literally take it out of the survivor and into a sick person maybe we can save the sick person...   Oh wow.   And so its very crude. Its super crude...   Its sounding super medieval all of a sudden the way that youre saying it.   I know. I know. Like what century are we living in?    We dont really know why it works but it kind of works so just get that in there!   Its like and we know that its you know safe in the sense that that blood was in another person. Like its almost like youve already done a human trial like if you take my blood from me it didnt hurt me right so Im giving it to someone else. And weve also...   Couldnt there be bad things in that blood? Couldnt there be like a -- couldnt there be bad stuff?   Okay. Right right right. Let me explain how it works. So you would take somebody who has survived coronavirus. You would stick them in a chair you would stick a needle in their arm and then you would take their blood you would filter out the blood plasma leaving behind the red blood cells and the white blood cells. You would then take the plasma and you would put it into a patient who currently has coronavirus.   Now wait. What is plasma?   So you know plasma is the part of the blood that does not contain any living cells. So it does not have white blood cells it does not have red blood cells but it has the other stuff that makes up your blood. And the thought is is that the blood plasma is the part of the blood that holds anything that might have fought against an illness. Like the antibodies right? And so antibodies are the things that your body makes to fight an intruder. So a virus comes in and we make an antibody to attack that virus. And then you have -- it is almost like your body makes its own drug.   I see so if I survived the coronavirus that means that for reasons that we dont really understand I have some special drug in my blood plasma that can maybe help someone else fight it off too.   Yeah.   If you look at the different options that are out there this has a good likelihood of working.   This is Arturo Casadevall. Hes an immunologist at Johns Hopkins. And was reall the first person in The States to say we should start doing this.   I have been working on antibodies for my entire academic life. And I like history and -- I read a lot about the history of how antibodies were used.   This is not the first time we have thought about doing something like this. We have actually been doing it since the 1890s...   What was it used for initially? Like in the 1890s. What -- was it like tuberculosis or ...?   They first used it for diphtheria.   Ah! Im not sure I know what diphtheria is?   Well here wait. Let us look.  I dont -- I couldnt actually --  dip...theria. I couldnt actually explain what the -- diphtheria is an infection caused by a bacterium. Diphtheria causes a thick covering in the back of the throat. It can lead to difficulty breathing heart failure paralysis.   And so they used it on that?   Yeah.   And in that case the serum did not come from people it came from horses.   Ooh!   Yes.   Did that work?   It did work. But then they realized you could do it with human blood too.   Ah.   By the way it was used in 1918. But in the influenza epidemic.   Hmm.   I wonder why they got that idea then.   Oh because it was known at the time that people who recovered from infectious diseases made antibodies. That was known. The first Nobel prize by the way in 1901 was given to Emil von Behring for the -- for this discovery that you could transfer immunity...   Oooh.   By transferring serum.   Wow.   You know they used it in the '20s for scarlet fever. They did it in a measles outbreak in Pennsylvania in the '30s. It seemed to -- seemed to stop an outbreak.   Oh so people got better?   Oh yeah.   However that practice was largely abandoned after 1950 for two reasons. One vaccines came on board. And the other thing was that they discovered that blood in some circumstances could carry infectious diseases.   Then you have an interesting thing where like the AIDS epidemic you know if you think about HIV that is definitely pathogen in blood. So you see a bit of a pause. And in any blood story you see a pause around   Oh that is really interesting...   Around the AIDS crisis. But then technology improves we have so many ways of screening blood and screening blood really quickly. You start seeing them using it in the SARS epidemic. Its been used in MERS that -- that respiratory infection which is a coronavirus. It is been used on other coronaviruses basically.   So when I saw that this was happening and beginning to spread through the world I knew that this could potentially be used. This could provide an option. Obviously you know like any therapy it needs to be tested. And I reinforce that over and over again. That one needs to look at this as an experimental therapy especially   As of this week which is you know the second to last week in March the FDA has given like emergency approval to both start investigating like the plasma transfers you know with clinical trials and sort of you know scientific protocol. But then they have also okayed it for compassionate use. Which is that like if you have a case and they seem like they are failing can you -- can you use it?   I see.   You can now use it. That is what the FDA is saying. You now can use it.   And this is happening in New York right? I mean these are -- its just starting.   Yes. So Mount Sinai in New York and Albert Einstein Medical College have said that they hope to start using it in patients on the ground the very beginning of April essentially. And Arturo and the other scientists involved in this were saying one of the amazing things about doing the blood plasma transfers is you are gonna find out really quick if it works.   This is not gonna be one of those trials that requires years to be completed on . I think that there is a good likelihood that we -- that once you deploy this that you will know whether it is working in a few weeks. That this is something that can -- can be tried today.   Okay. Wow. Okay so let us get -- getting back to so many things.   Okay.   But wait a second. But wait a second. Wait -- but wait a second. Wait -- but wait a second. Wait a second. ipDTL chill out. Chill out ipDTL. Okay...   Hold on let me look at mine too...   We are good. We are good.   Okay. We are doing good. Okay so we were at ...   Why -- why is not it been like  -- like ramped up at scale? I mean there is no way for you to know this answer.   Because there is not really a scale. Like it is like you have to find people who had the illness and you have to take their blood from them and you have to make sure that blood is healthy. Then if it is you take their plasma from them and then you give it to someone else. That is really kind of like a one-to-one...   But that is interesting Molly cause its like maybe this is the -- okay Im just going to go wild with conjecture for a moment.   Do it.   Maybe this is the scale moment because you have so many people who are infected...   We have so many.   And there all in the same place. And some of them are getting better magically and some of them arent. And so you have like the ability to do like a massive   Yeah.   A natural experiment. No?   But the other thing is is that so China's actually been doing this I think since January for their outbreak with -- with this COVID-19.   How -- they have been doing transfusions?   They have been doing this serum transfusion yeah.   Wow.   And so -- and the reports are that it is going well though nothing's published yet.   I mean I guess I do not quite understand why it would not work. It is like you take someone's blood that defeated the virus and you give it to someone else and it seems like would not it do the same thing?   So one of the problems with this type of therapy is that it works best early. Antibodies work best early in the course of disease.   And the question is when is earlier? And with COVID-19 that is a tricky question because often you have a viral count that is growing before you have symptoms.   And so -- so a lot of times people are not even seeing people until it is like really bad. So it makes it tricky...   Right but I think there is a big difference between really bad and the intensive care unit.   Oh okay. Okay.   And maybe this intervention we -- and again I stress that this will be a clinical trial. This is a hypothesis that needs to be tested. The administration of -- of plasma at that point of view may -- may prevent progression of the disease. So its that people do not get into such trouble that they have to be on a respirator.   And so it looks like in the States they are gonna break it down. Like in New York they are gonna target like these three different groups. So they are gonna target severe patients who really need help and are at risk of dying. They are gonna target early patients who are just showing symptoms. And they are also -- they also want to use it prophylactically. So actually giving it to doctors and nurses who have no viral count who are coronavirus negative and see if it can actually be a preventative.   Whoa. That feels new...   Yeah. And that is actually pretty cool.   That is really cool. That feels to me like -- wow that feels to me like if they could do that they should just do that you know?   I mean I would take it now.   Totally.   And I am in my closet.    No I know. I mean I think about my sister-in-law who is a nurse who is treating COVID patients and man if there was something that could help her its like whoof.   Yeah.   I mean theres something kind of like just to pan out for a second its like as a paradigm its such an interesting intimate way to treat cause I mean these days you know like the whole field of medicine seem to be moving toward little pills that you -- that you pop and you drink. You take these pills and they do something mysterious in your body and you feel better. This is so intimate in that it is one person having suffered and survived then turning to the next person who is a few days behind them suffering and saying Let me help you. There is something very spiritual in a way about that.   Yeah. I find it -- when Arturo and I were talking about it on the phone it felt very profound and like really beautiful in the sense. Like he talked about it as like sharing immunity. Like we can pass immunity to each other. And I thought Wow short of social distancing where we are all staying in our houses to protect as many people as we can that feels like such a golden gift. Like to be able to transfer something so profound to a person as like protection. It is like you can shepherd someone in it is like you can offer them safe passage. And it is -- it is safe passage. And its...   Safe passage...   Safe passage it is such a metaphorical level.   It is the same thing that I get when I hear about people donating kidneys you know? But this is -- this is somehow different.   Because they have had it. Like it is one thing to just like give a donation...   Yes.   It is another thing to say like I had this experience and I am gonna hold your hand through it. And I am not physically holding your hand because none of us are allowed but I am like spiritually holding your hand because I am giving you my blood and I am -- and I am helping you walk this path. I am helping you take this journey.     Coming up we talk to somebody who in a way is taking that journey. Thats after the break.        Hello?   Hi is this Tatiana?   Yes it is!   Okay! Hey it is Molly from Radiolab.   How are you?   I am good! Can you hear me okay?   Yeah I can hear you fine. Can you hear me?   I can yeah. There might be -- there is like I think    Hey this is Jad. This is Radiolab is back. Just wanna play you now an expert of an interview that Molly did with someone who is really right in the thick of this stuff.   So my name is Dr. Tatiana Prowell. I am an internist and medical oncologist on faculty at Johns Hopkins in the Breast Cancer Program.   And Molly ended up talking to Tatiana because of a tweet that she posted.   Can you tell me in your own words what the tweet was about? And what it said?   Sure. So the tweet was about my brother-in-law's dad we call him Papadoc he is actually an internist in California. I called him. You know I talked to my brother-in-law about something else actually. And I just said How is everybody? and he said Oh my dad's a little under the weather. And I said Wait wait. How? How is he under the weather? You know he is 83 he is practicing medicine he is high risk. Right? And he said Oh well he is just been coughing a little bit. I do not think he is had fever or anything. And I literally said I am gonna call him I will call you back. And I hung up and I called him. And he said Oh I am fine I have just had a little bit of a cough but I actually feel fine. I am not short of breath at all. And his wife volunteered Yeah he seems fine he looks fine he is just been napping more than usual. Normally he does not just nap during the day and he is been napping. He is been falling asleep in the couch and so forth. And I said Alright that is it. You guys are going to Urgent Care right now. I think you are hypoxic I think your oxygen level is low. They thought I was being crazy. And I said We are just gonna talk about one thing before you go and that is whether or not you are willing to be intubated. And he actually laughed! He was like I just have this dry cough! Like hy are we talking about a ventilator? And I just said I am worried about you because you are falling asleep inappropriately and you are 83. And you are a doctor which means I am sure you have been exposed to these patients. And he said Yeah if you think I should do that.   Wow.    And I just said Listen you know we can support you but you have to go right now because I think you have COVID-19. And he went to the Urgent Care straight from that call. He hung up he went. His oxygen saturation was 92 it should be 100. They sent him directly from there to the ER. And he has COVID-19 illness. And has been hospitalized now for a little over a week.   Wow.   And is in their Intensive Care Unit in a community hospital. In fact the same community hospital where he was on staff for many decades. And so my tweet was asking if there was anyone who had had COVID-19 and recovered and who was interested in serving as a potential donor of plasma in Southern California where hes currently hospitalized.   And how did you I mean I guess you are a doctor so maybe you are in the zone but you are about to tell me. Like how did you know even to think about asking for plasma or like think like Maybe he could get a plasma transfusion?   Yeah. I think it is a mix of things. So one is that I am on faculty at Johns Hopkins and as I believe you know a lot of the work that is going on with convalescent plasma has been centered there. And the other thing is that my husband is an infectious diseases physician in the Navy. And so -- and he is actually...   Oh man all-star family.    Were -- we have been bouncing a lot of ideas back and forth about how best to take care of people with this. And of course this is not a new concept. You know no one just got the idea to give convalescent plasma right at this moment for the first time. This has been done going back more than 100 years. And it is a way honestly for people who have experienced this illness and recovered to contribute at a time that I feel like the public really wants to contribute you know? I think that that is a thing I sense so much from my friends and family and neighbors and everyone who is not in medicine is they are all -- they are all rooting for us who are in science and medicine. But they are all at the same time feeling kind of like they want -- they want to do something. They have this restlessness. Everybody's quarantined. Everybody's kids are home. They are watching the new or they are watching social media and they are feeling like this catastrophe is unfolding and they are just sitting there. I think that -- I think that there is this sense that we are at war and the war is being fought by a very small number of people. There will be millions of cases in the US before this is over. Millions and millions. And not all of those people will be qualified to donate plasma but many of them will. And so it is a great opportunity.   I have to --  like I am like what happened with your tweet? Like did you get blood?     So -- oh gosh. Wel I tweeted that late at night. I cannot recall what time it was. But it was -- it was late. And honestly I did not expect it would get a lot of attention. And within minutes I had hundreds of people commenting retweeting private messaging me telling me This is my blood type. You know This is how many days ago I was sick. Where exactly do you need me to go? Which day? I can see if I can get off of work. I mean people just...   Really?   Came out of the woodwork! I had people messaging me with a -- with a PDF of their -- their test results to show me what day it was positive! I mean I just got all kinds of stuff. And they were suddenly not just contacting me as a donor suddenly people just realized Oh my gosh! There are hundreds of people that want to donate! My family member needs plasma! So then suddenly I had people messaging me saying We are looking for plasma! Help! Like have you gotten anyone who is in New York? Have you gotten anyone who is in Louisiana?...   Wow.   Do you have anyone who is this blood type? So suddenly I was sitting on my bed trying to match these people up and I spent pretty much three days in my pajamas on my bed trying to match people up. It became you know complex because it is really impractical right? That is not the way to do it...   You are only one person.   Exactly.   I mean how did you feel like having the weight of all of this on you? Like were you like Am I gonna find a donor? Am I not gonna find a donor? People think I am gonna find a donor and what if I do not? I want to save this but I cannot.   You know I think I was always -- I was always confident we would find somebody...   How come?   Well a few things. One is I am an oncologist. And you talk to a handful of oncologists I think a thing that you discover instantly is that oncologists are really optimists. Like deeply optimistic people. Certainly oncologists of a certain age and I put myself in that category I am 47. I think anyone who is been doing oncology for 10 or 15 or 20 years has to be an optimist because we were taking care of people with cancer when the treatments were really not very effective in a lot of cases you know? We lost a lot of people. And you really have to I think come into it everyday with the attitude of I might be able to save this person. I think the other thing though was just a kind of an understanding of statistics. I mean it is a pandemic right? It grows exponentially the number of cases are doubling every three days or something. So I realized you know the same way that it did not take very long for this this outbreak to get completely out of hand and essentially close down the world it also was not going to take very long for me to have a really large number of qualified donors who were -- had been infected and recovered.   Did he -- did you find a match? Online?   We did actually find a match. And his -- we just found a match. And the person lives a few hours away from where my Papadoc is hospitalized. He actually has the first -- same first name as one of the patient's sons which they felt was very symbolic. And so the pheresis and transfusion is supposed to happen tomorrow Tuesday.   Wow. So last question. What do the next couple of days look like for you in the case of Papadoc?   Yeah. So he you know hes -- his donor is coming tomorrow and -- and the blood draw will happen. And then the plasma will be tested and processed and transfused into him tomorrow with the expectation. And then we wait. And we see. You know I think that we are hoping that -- that it will help him clear the virus pretty quickly. That is the hope.   Yeah.   I think that having an infection maybe even being critically ill from it recovering. And then saying I know how awful that was how scary that was how -- how absolutely uncertain everything felt when I was sick. And I have the capacity me myself. I can go give plasma and if I give a plasma donation like a plasmapheresis donation where they take off three units of plasma I can treat three people with this. That is it. Because you know it is interesting every virus has a number that we call R Naught. Its like R sub-zero. Are not is how it is pronounced. And that number is how many people an average infected person will themselves infect. So if you look at you know some of our less contagious things like seasonal flu those are closer to one. If you look at Spanish Flu it was about two or a little more than two. So each person who got infected on average gave two other people the infection. And this -- this virus SARS COV2 is closer to three. So that means everybody on average who is got it is gonna give it to three other people. So it feels kinda cool like there is some kind of order in the universe that each person who gets it who donates plasma can actually treat three people.   Wow I didnt realize it was three. I thought it was at most two.   Yeah its three. And I just you know the -- what do I call it? I do not know what. The symmetry of that in the universe that the R Naught for this virus is three and the number of people that a plasma donor can treat after they have been infected is three. It just feels like I do not know. There is something beautiful about that.   Wow you have given me a lot to think about. And also just feels so good to just like share thoughts and ideas. So thank you for that. Sharing your own and listening and responding back and stuff. Like sort of in the middle of all this crazy...   Oh yeah! No the listen that is the humanity in it right? Like that is the -- if something good comes from all this it is that we kind of just distilled down like -- like all the unnecessary stuff is gone right? Like what is left is what really matters. Like you are down to Do we have sufficient nutrition to keep our bodies going? Are we with the people that we love most? And are they safe? Are we able to do our most essential work even if it is hard and it is made more complex? You know like we really -- I mean that is that is the little tiny tiny pearl at the center of all this is that it forces us to say What is essential? And part of that essentialness is connecting with other people. Meaningfully deeply. You know? That is a big part of it. The thing -- the greatest tragedy in my mind of this entire illness --  which we did not touch on at all -- is the fact that people die alone.   Yeah...   So you know in the case of Papadoc a thing that has been really hard for our family was they sent him directly to the ER. And his wife called me and said We went there and they heard what his oxygen level was and that he had been coughing and that he was a physician. And they took him right back into the isolation area as a  a Person Under Investigation for COVID-19. And they will not let me into the ER because I am not symptomatic. And they do not want me to be exposed and I cannot be with him because he is now in this isolation unit. And that is the last time she saw him. Like she literally pulled up to the ER and he went in and she is never seen him again. And if he died she would never see him alive again. And that is the greatest tragedy. There is gonna be so much tragedy from this right. We are gonna lose so much life. We are gonna lose lives of people that are on the front lines as first responders and as physicians and nurses. And we are gonna lose people who are young. But I think amidst all that other tragedy the biggest tragedy is going to be that hundreds of thousands or millions of people before this is over will die alone. In many cases these patients are not even attended by a physician when they are dying. You go -- you have a phone call with them from outside the room. You only go in the room if you need to lay hands on the patient to do a procedure or something. These people are going into the hospital they walk into the ER they are coughing or something. And they do not know they do not realize -- I did not even realize. I mean I realized but I did not think of it. I knew if he went in there that he would immediately be put into a room as a Person Under Investigation but I did not -- it happened so fast that I did not say like Tell him you love him. Like spend ten minutes in the car before you went -- send him in. You have been -- you have been living with him for weeks! Like you have been exposed. Like take ten minutes. He is not critically ill. Take ten minutes and talk to each other. Say what you need to say. Tell him the logistics stuff. Like whatever you need to do like do it! And I did not think to do that. And I am a physician. I knew that these people were being isolated and it did not occur to me. But for somebody who does not realize that they drive their family member up to the ER and that is it! The people who die they will never lay eyes on them again. You know I think a lot about death. I have attended a lot of death as an oncologist. A lot. Like I cannot -- I have been a doctor for 21 years. And I have been an oncologist for gosh 17 of those -- 18 -- 16 of those or something? A lot -- a lot of years. I cannot even begin to guess how many deaths I have pronounced. I have been a witness to death a lot of times. And there are a lot of things that distinguish a good death from a bad death you know? Being free of pain and having closed all your loops. You know not feeling like you are dying with unfinished business on either side on the part of the person who is dying or on the part of the survivors. Like that is the thing you know. If you are prepared if you are not surprised by death those are the people who have a good death you know. I think there is just some sort of peace and resolution in the end of suffering. These deaths are the exact opposite of that. It is the worst death. No one's prepared for it. No one has closed the loop. No one got the logistics ready. No one did the emotional hard work of making sure that everyone's said what they need to say and people have forgiven whom they need to forgive. And -- none of that is done. I dunno it is a lot to -- it is a lot to think about people dying alone...Are you still there? Hello?        Hello!   That was such a dramatic ending.  I am so sorry...   I know! I -- No I think that is how you should end it actually.   I...   That is just -- that is that is like the universe telling you That is the end.   You -- you got isolated in the end while talking about ends of isolation. And I was like I can hear you and I can feel you and I have like tears in my eyes and this is deeply moving but for some reason my microphone's not working!   That is the universe telling you That is the end of that show! That is that is it.   Wow...   Yeah. It is a lot.   I so appreciate you. Thank you...   Well likewise.   I definitely want you to get back to saving peoples' lives though.    Thanks.   Wow.   I have gotten all these texts while we have been talking actually. I was just looking I just had another person while we have been -- while you called me back.  Oh whoops. Oh sorry actually hang on. This is actually Papadoc's doctor. I have to go!   Okay! Go go go! Bye bye bye!   Bye!    What a crazy experience.     We checked in with Tatiana after that conversation. Papadoc had his transfusion on Wednesday night. As of Thursday night when we finished this podcast he was still in the ICU still on a ventilator hanging on. We will let you know more when we find it out.   So I want to stress that there are a lot of people working on this right as we speak. And what I can -- what I can tell you is that the current working criteria is that we are gonna wait two weeks two weeks after the symptoms stop. Then at that point you test them for the virus to make sure the virus is really gone. And then you ask them to donate blood and then you look for antibodies from the blood. And those people with high antibody become donors.   If you have had COVID-19 and recovered and youd like to donate plasma go to our website Radiolab.org. Weve compiled a bunch of resources there for you. We tried to make it as clear as possible. You can go to the website of the American Red Cross RedCrossBlood.org. RedCrossBlood.org to find out more information there. If youre in New York City check out New York Blood Center to figure out how to donate. Thank you for listening. Be safe out there. Special thanks in this episode to Evan Block and Dr. Tim Bin. Im Jad Abumrad. Thank you all for listening. Stay safe. Keep taking care of each other.    Copyright  2019 New York Public Radio.
