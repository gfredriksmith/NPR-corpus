 You are listening to Radiolab from- Dennis WNYC.  -and NJPR. Dennis I think there is a lot of moments in your life that you find yourself doing something. Brittany Is there anybody in here? My name is Brittany. I would love to be able to talk with you. Dennis You take that moment and step back from it. Brittany Are you here? Robert And you realize- Brittany Come through join us. Dennis -What the fuck am I doing?  Dennis What just happened was this real? I think that was one of those moments. Jad Abumrad Hey I am Jad Abumrad. Robert I am Robert Krulwich. Jad This is Radiolab and today on the podcast a ghost story. Robert Really? We are going to do a ghost story? Jad Yes it is Halloween dude. You do not even know just listen. Just let us listen okay? Robert Okay. Jad This one comes from our producer Matt Kielty. I first heard this story from a buddy of mine. His name is Dennis Conrow. Andy Dennis? Dennis Andy? Andy Hey what is up dude? Jad That is producer Andy Mills. You guys are all buddies total buds. Andy Anyways back to the story. All right. Well Dennis. Dennis Yes? Jad It is about a lot of things but in particular a house. Andy Let us start with the house. When did you move back in? Dennis Well let us see. I was probably I do not know age 20. Jad Dennis had been going to college. Dennis By the way what did you study? Dennis Creative writing but I just got bored there stopped going to class.  I think once my parents realized that they were not very happy. Andy I would assume so. Dennis I was asked to come back home. Andy Back to a town just outside Kansas City. Dennis A little town called Grandview. Andy Did you grow up in this house? Dennis I did. The house was- Andy Fairly old? Dennis Yes it was about 105 years old at the time. Andy Two-storey white house nice little porch awning over it. Dennis Typical farmhouse style. Andy You were at your parents' home back in your old bedroom? Dennis Yes in my old childhood bedroom. There was always a sense of I need to get out of this house. It is holding me back somehow from things. Andy You got a job. Dennis Worked a job and got laid off. Andy One year turned into two and then three then four and then five. Dennis It was not a great time to be there. Andy In what way? Dennis Just that I felt like I was still 16. Andy He says he would overhear his mom telling people on the phone. Dennis Well he is never going to move out is he?  Andy Then she started circling classifieds. Dennis Jobs for typists printing press sales rep typesetter. I do not know. I think everything in my life however I mean for it not to moves at my own snail's pace. Andy Eventually- Dennis I was fairly old like 27 maybe. Andy Actually he was 28. After eight years in this house Dennis gets a steady job finds this cheap apartment. Dennis This ratty six-plex apartment. Andy He starts packing up his things but right when he set to move out to finally leave home- Dennis My mom got really sick. Andy Dennis's mom had been in remission from breast cancer for nine years but that summer her doctors told her that it had returned. Dennis Had spread quite a bit. I said to her Do you want me to be here or do you want me to go? She was like Well if this is my time she wants to go knowing that her kids can take care of themselves. Andy Dennis moved out. About five months later his mom died. Dennis She went pretty fast. About a month or so after my mom died my dad found out he had stage four prostate cancer. Andy Wow. Dennis He was really too sick to take care of the house and just be the guy by himself at that point. Andy Now Dennis pretty much had to come home. Dennis I would take care of him- Andy Three four times a week. Dennis As he got worse he had said to me Hey let us try to find you a house to buy so that I can teach you how to do all of the stuff that one has to do. Men know how to do things like change out plumbing all this kind of stuff. We put an offer on a house. Andy That fell through. Before they could find something else- Dennis The cancer from his prostate spread to his brain and the last week of his life he was really not there. I can remember one day maybe a week or so after he had died. Andy Dennis was walking through the empty kitchen. Dennis There was so much stuff. Papers all over the place junk mail all over the kitchen floor. Andy Down in the basement. Dennis Tools all over the place. I had this moment of Here are his tools now I have them in my hands. I just remember picking up this claw hammer and just crying because this is now my hammer this is now my house this is now my problem. Andy A few days passed and he starts thinking I can handle this. I have just got to get in there clean it out sell it. Dennis Clean and flip that was the plan. Andy At the age of 32 moves back in. Dennis There was all this just junk in the basement. Andy Put that stuff on the curb. Dennis Sale after sale after sale. Andy One day he finds himself standing in the downstairs bathroom looking at the nasty floor tile. Dennis It was just horrible. Andy His dad had meant to replace it before he died but could not finish. Dennis My thought was Just do this one bathroom so that it looks pretty good to sell. Andy The problem was his dad had never showed him how to do any of that stuff. Dennis It was at that point that I was like YouTube.  Now hold the tile in one hand firmly and begin with your ceramic tile. Andy He went online learned how to tile do some plumbing and he redid the bathroom. Dennis It turned out pretty good it was fun. Then the next thing I knew I was taking the wallpaper off in the kitchen that is got to go. Hardwood floors insulation in the attic glass block windows in the basement. Andy Pretty soon- Dennis That turned into the whole house. Andy How long did that take? Dennis Five years. Andy Actually it was six. Dennis Wow. Andy He says the whole time he was doing this renovation at night- Dennis I would have these dreams where my parents just came through the back door and it was just like What are you doing here? That is right you are dead. Then I would turn my back and then they would have somehow undone all of the things that I did. Andy They had brought the house back to the state it was in when they were alive? Dennis Yes and I probably had this dream I am not kidding at least 100 times. Andy Night after night after night. Dennis That would have just kept going on and on and ultimately it drove me crazy. Andy One day after yet another one of these dreams Dennis is finally like All right I am selling it. Puts it up on the market starts waiting for a buyer and then something strange happens. Dennis Well something kind of strange. I had made this friend and she came over for the first time. Andy It is like a date a lady friend? Dennis Yes it was a lady friend. Andy You have gone on a date you have taken her back to your house. Denis was giving her a tour showing her all the improvements until- Dennis She was in the kitchen. Andy Right by the basement door in the kitchen when- Dennis She was like There is some kind of weird presence here. I was just like Okay. That was a sign that I was not going to last.  Andy Fast forward a few years. Dennis I did not really think too much about it. Andy Until one day Denis's realtor is having an open house no one shows. Dennis She was in the house by herself. Andy Denis starts getting these text messages from her. Dennis Dude your house is haunted. I can hear people walking around. Andy She texted that there was definitely something weird going on. Dennis Right by the basement door. Andy Wait that is the same spot? Dennis Yes. I am just like That is kind of weird. Then here's the crazy thing. Andy Not too long after this Dennis bumps into an old friend of his and he is like Hey funny thing. Two different people two separate occasions had come over to the house and they said they felt this weird presence. Dennis She was like Wait right by the basement door? Andy Get out. Dennis I was like Okay. I have got Heather I have got Stacy I have got Carla all three who say they feel this weird presence. Andy Did you consider yourself a bit of a skeptic about such things? Dennis I would say so. Rationally I am just going to say no. Andy You do not believe in ghosts? Dennis No. Andy What happened next? Dennis This also happened to be right at the time that I sold the house. Andy Dennis had finally put some pen to paper signed the contract packed up all the stuff. Dennis Carla the girl that first felt this thing- Andy The girl he went on a date with they stayed friends. Dennis -said to me I am really curious about this. Would you mind if I call these ghost people to come and check out this place. I was like Well sure. I do not care why not? Very shortly in a few minutes actually we are bringing paranormal investigators to find out what is in the basement. I am just walking through the house I think I got this on tape of just me walking through the house. I am like Well this is probably a waste of time but I am still curious about it. Andy It is Friday night what else are you going to do? Dennis Right. It is a Friday night mid-November. Andy Around six oclock. Dennis I can see some cars parking on the street. I go downstairs. Andy People start following in. Dennis Maybe 10 people. Brittany We all have different specialties. Larry's our tech guy. Dennis About four techies. Two sets of clairvoyants. Brittany Chantelle's the psychic- Katie -she is very gifted. Andy Who are all these people? Dennis Can I get you to just say your name? Brittany My name is Brittany Elaine. Dennis Well they are part of the Kansas City paranormal investigators club or some kind of thing. Andy Pretty much right off the bat- Dennis When you guys came in and you were saying you could talk. Brittany When we first got here we both saw a woman looking out the window at the top. Dennis What did she look like? Brittany I did not really see what she looked like. Katie can describe her.  Katie She had long hair. It was like gray. She was wearing one of those weird old-timey dresses. Andy Dennis was like Whatever. Dennis They set up cameras in the basement and then in the kitchen. Andy The clairvoyants decided they wanted to try to talk to this woman or maybe any other spirit in the house. Brittany- Brittany I do not know if I even explained to you we do. Andy -was the ringleader of the night. Dennis She explained how she does things. She was like the best way that she could get them to talk to them was through flashlights. Andy What they do is they take a few flashlights turn them on and then they unscrew the tops of them just enough so that they turn off. Then they just set the flashlights that are now off in the room by themselves. The idea is that if the ghost or the spirit wants to communicate they can just touch the top of one of the flashlights with their ghostly finger and that'ill turn it back on. Brittany It is barely connected. All they have to do is either push or pull a tiny bit of energy.  I see. It is not that hard. Brittany It is obvious for them to do. Dennis I was like Okay. She took three flashlights and we all sat in this dark room in a circle. Andy Brittany sets the flashlights in the middle of the circle by themselves. No one's touching them. Dennis She says- Brittany If there is anybody in here my name is Brittany. I would love to be able to talk with you. Can you turn one of those lights on? Dennis We sit there and we sit there. Brittany Are you here? Dennis Then all of a sudden this light barely blinks on. Then she said Okay. Brittany Thank you. Dennis Please turn it off. Then it goes off. Brittany What we can do with these lights here is if I can ask them- Dennis Then she says We have three lights here. The one you just turned on we will call yes. Please turn on one more and that will be no. Brittany If you could do that for us that will be wonderful. Dennis Then a second light comes on. Andy No way. Are you scanning the room looking for somebody who has a little switch or something? Dennis Yes. We did not pay these people. They have no reason to fake this I suppose. I just keep thinking Well the house is really close to the train tracks and maybe the train- Andy Vibrations of the train? That makes sense. Dennis All of a sudden they were like Can you hear that? Footsteps? Brittany There is somebody walking right here in front of me. Dennis They are going towards the kitchen. I could hear dishes rattling on the countertop in the kitchen. Andy No one's in the kitchen? Dennis No one's in the kitchen. Brittany If you are in the kitchen right now can you turn one of these lights on? Andy They sit and stare at these three flashlights. Then-  Dennis I am just leaving the room.  Robert What happened? Jad Well actually everyone in that room died except for Dennis. Robert Oh God.  Robert I have no idea why I even invited you into this building.  Robert They did not die. Jad What happened to them?   You scared me. Andy Actually they are fine.  Was that you? Andy It turns out that there was a guy downstairs in the basement one of the techies walking around pitch-black down there and he just like bangs his head into an air duct and the sound is reverberated throughout the whole house.  Andy Scared them a little bit. It was very Blair Witchy. Anyhow the techies- Dennis Decided they to get the three psychics down in the basement by themselves. These three women go down in the basement by themselves. We hear them downstairs talking but we do not really know what is going on.  That was interesting. Dennis They come back upstairs. Brittany How did it go? Dennis They said- Katie The girl was downstairs. Dennis She was definitely down there. Andy The old woman that they first saw when they got to the house. They said that she was standing down in the basement next to where the old furnace used to be. They told Dennis that she said that she would lived here for a long time. Dennis was like Wait a second. He knew that back in the '30s or something a woman had lived in this house. Dennis Who was not all there. Andy One day she had gone down into the basement. Dennis Thought she was picking lice off her chickens and throwing them into this big furnace that was downstairs in the basement at the time. Andy She got a little too close to the furnace the story goes. Dennis Caught herself on fire and then died there in the basement. Katie Then there was another man downstairs who showed himself to me but he will not talk and he just completely disappeared. Dennis What did he look like? Katie He was bald. He was about this eight but it was not right. Dennis Did he have a build like me? Katie Yes. Dennis A lot like me? Katie Not a lot but similar. Definitely. Dennis If I were just to show you a picture of my father would you have any sense of this was him? Katie If I saw a picture of him. Yes maybe. Dennis I found this the other day. Andy Dennis goes and gets this photo of his dad that he had that was left over from his memorial service. Katie Yes. That is man I saw. Dennis Really? Katie Yes. Dennis Wow. Katie Yes that is the man I found. Dennis Let us process for just a second here. She is very hesitant at the beginning. It is like well- Andy I should jump in here really quick and just tell you that this was actually the first time that Dennis had ever listened to this tape. Jad Really? Andy Yes. The reason is because for a long time he did not want to listen to it. Robert Why? Andy Well I think part of it had to do with this moment because- Dennis This was the point where my skepticism kicked off. Jad Part of it had to do with what happens next. Andy That is coming up when we return. Jad This is Radiolab. Let us get back to Matt Kielty's ghost story. We will pick up with our main guy Dennis Conrow having just heard from the ghost hunters that they encountered a spirit in the basement of his home who looks remarkably like his dead father. Katie Yes. That is the man I saw here. Dennis He is here? Katie Yes. He is here. Dennis Can we try to talk to him? Katie We can try to talk to him absolutely. Dennis Is he in the basement or here? Katie I feel like he went upstairs not in the basement anymore. Dennis Can we go upstairs and just talk to him? Katie Yes absolutely. Dennis I had not really told them a whole lot about what the different rooms in the house were but they led me upstairs to what was his room. Brittany Let us do this. Dennis To the corner of the room where his bed was. Andy They had no idea that they used to be there? Dennis They had no idea. I said to them Well if he is going to talk he will just talk to me. All right Dad are you here? You could turn on the lights if you are. Thank you. Thank you Dad. We are going to call that yes. You can turn that one off now and turn on the no light any other light please? I need to know that you are here. Brittany There you go. Dennis Thanks dad. Brittany Do you want us to leave? Dennis Dad would you like these people to leave and just talk to me? Brittany Yes. That is okay let us leave them alone. Dennis Dad I would want to know are you in a good spot? Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay Dad? Yes? Good. I am glad to hear that. Everything off. Everything's off almost. Almost Dad. Thanks. Hey I am going to ask you this. Is Mom here too? Is Mom here too? The other of the three flashlights lights up. Yes? She is here. Hi Mom. Now that you are both here I love you very much and I miss you both. I have so many questions for you I cannot ask them all. They are just yes or no questions. I said Have you been able to see the things that I have done to the house? Both of the lights lit up very brightly Yes. I have lived here for six years redone the house. I have gone and done a lot of things. Then I said What do you think are you happy with this? Are you happy with the things I have done with the house? They both lit up very brightly Yes. I said Are you proud of me? Are you proud of what I have done who I am how I am doing? That is weird.  That is a very bright yes. It means a lot to me. In a few days guys I will probably never set foot in this house again and I do not want you to stay here and feel like you belong here. I want you to go out and be free. Can you let go of this house to finally move on? That is fine. I am going to leave you guys. You have been haunting my dreams a lot about this house. I know it is very important to you. It is very important to me. It is time we leave right? Yes. All right. Katie Are you okay? Dennis Yes. Katie Do you want a hug?  Brittany I think you need one.  Andy That is where it ends? Dennis Yes. That is how I recall it being. Exactly like that. I teared up. Andy Keep in mind that this was the first time that Dennis had heard this tape and so we played it back to him because we just wanted to see how he remembered that experience. Dennis I guess part of my fear of listening to it was that it would change it and that it would be a different experience. It would be a little more hokey and it would be a little more unclear what was happening but listening to it again it was as I recalled it being. Jad In the end does he believe he was actually talking to his dead parents? Andy No. I ended up actually calling this guy who explained to me how this whole flashlight thing works and that there is a perfectly nonparanormal explanation as to what is going on with the flashlight. Robert It almost feels bad manners at this point to have a practical explanation but I am very curious to hear it. Andy What is going on is you turn the flashlight on. When you turn the flashlight on the bulb gets really hot. Then you take the top of the flashlight and you unscrew it just enough that the flashlight flickers off. The flashlight's off and the bulb it got really hot so the inside of the flashlight also got really hot. There is this little piece of plastic inside the flashlight that when it got hot it expanded. Since the flashlight's off that piece of plastic it starts to cool down and starts to contract. When it contracts it pushes these two tiny bits of metal together these two little bits of metal come into contact. That is your circuit. The circuit opens the light bulb it goes back on. Robert Then it warms again and cools again. Andy Then it gets hot this little piece of plastic it starts to get hot. it starts to expand it pushes the two pieces apart. Robert These people chose this flashlight because it had that particular property? Jad Do you think it is like a con or something? Andy No I do not think so. I even talked to Dennis about this. He is like I think they are just trying to make sense of randomness. I do not think they necessarily know that this flashlight does this thing and therefore they can manipulate people. Robert Here's why I do not think it is a con because in this case it is such a strange coincidence that whenever he wants his mom and dad his ghostly mother and father to approve of him and congratulate him and honor him with a yes it is random he could get a no but he gets a yes. Andy It is just chance. Jad You told Dennis all this? Matt Yes I told Dennis because you told me to tell Dennis. Jad It is true. I forced him. When you told him what did he say? Andy On one level it did not faze him. Dennis basically said Look. Dennis Look I know that the way that the world works is the way that the world works. People do not come back from the dead. People do not talk to you through flashlights. Andy He also said that he is not going to let go of that experience. He wants to have it both ways. Dennis I guess so. I guess I want to have both yes this did not happen and yes this absolutely happened. Robert I understand that. Andy Because even if you are the world's biggest skeptic if you do not believe in ghosts. There really are not that many ways to talk about these sorts of things. These sorts of things that we all feel. Guilt for the things that we have done in our past the loss of those who we have loved. Ghost stories seem to stick around because they are an experience albeit a metaphorical experience but an experience that lets us talk about these things that we cannot adequately talk about. That feeling of being haunted. Jad Did he eventually sell the house move out? Andy Yes. He sold the house moved out. No more dreams of his parents haunting him. Well- Dennis It is been odd in the time that I have sold the house now. I thought the dreams would stop. Now the dreams are that I am the one haunting the house of the new people.  Where I will just walk in and just be like Hey I am here. Andy Are you going around repairing things? Dennis No. I am just being somewhat shocked at what they have done to it.  It is like it never stops.  Jad Thanks Matt. Matt No problem. Jad Matt Kielty.  Jad If you want to know a little bit more a little more detail about the flashlight trick. It is not really a trick the flashlight phenomenon you can check it out on our website radiolab.org. Matt's going to put a little post there that explains it in greater detail. Also you can see some pictures of Dennis's house. Robert That is all we can say at this holiday moment. Jad Indeed. Except our names I guess I am Jad Abumrad. Robert I am Robert Krulwich. Jad Thanks for listening.   Copyright  2021 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved. Visit our website terms of use at www.wnyc.org for further information.
