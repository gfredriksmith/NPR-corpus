 Welcome back to ex Lies And Audio Tape special. Today we are exploring what happens when your secret self exposes itself to your real self. And it happens Snappers. These machines the ones we have in our pocket they are getting smarter. And the smarter they get the more they try to convince us that we need them. They hold our calendars our contacts our directions. We outsource our memories. Functions we used to relegate to our noggins we now pass over to them. Snappers is that a good idea? Please understand our next story is 100 percent fiction and is also 100 percent true.    Hey mom did you just call me like 20 times in a row?   No I called you once. But now I have got you on the phone I have to tell you about the weirdest thing that just happened.   What just happened?   So I was making your dad some toast. And I was taking the bread out of the toaster. And - would you believe it? - it bit me.   What do you mean it bit you?   The door just snapped on my hand. It just closed on its own.   Well you know the door has a little hinge in it like a spring.   That is not what I am talking about. And look do not laugh. I burned my hand. It hurts.   I am sorry that you hurt your hand.   Well thanks. You know I am never going to get used to your voice like that.   My voice box?   I miss your...   I know mom. You have got to let it go. I - I need to go to bed. I got to get up early.   OK. I love you.   I love you too. Say hi to dad for me.   OK I will. Bye.   .    .   I wish I could talk to you instead of just talking for you. I could let you know that you probably should not hit the alarm clock anymore. Its red numbers are glowing a little brighter and I can feel that it is angry. It wants something. It is never gone off early like this. It is never disobeyed you before.   .    .    Well yeah you want to tell me about the traffic?  Traffic. Hey it is time for the traffic. All right all you commuters and commuterettes  out there. Traffic on the bridge today...   .   So you all might want to get an early start if you are trying to make it into the city 'ecause I know that is rough. Am I right or am I right?    Hey good morning. What is going on? Am I late?    Hey people good morning. So does anyone know what time it is? I think I heard someone on the train say that there was a solar flare or maybe electromagnetism something like that. Anyway no worries about coming in late. Let us just try and stay on track folks.   Whoa. Is anyone's watch working?   I have no idea. Somebody told me it was 10 a.m. on the train. But they did not really know. Their phone kept turning on and off.   Come on you stupid  - just work. Can anyone else get into the database?   I am in but I cannot get it to save anything.   It is just frozen. . I am going to go get some coffee. Anybody else want some?   You have got to go down to this street. The coffeemaker's out.   All right. I could use the walk.    Hey there.   Hey what can I get for you?   Could I just get a regular cup of coffee?   Sure 2.50.   Dr. Dean Nolan  head of the Department of Energy says that what we are actually experiencing is not machine malfunction but a new stage of mechanical consciousness. Some machines are actually banding together coming alive if you will.   Hey here you go.   Thanks.    Hello?   Hey. Look did you take your stuff with you?   I have my wallet but...   Good. Do not come back.   What?   To the office. Do not come back to the office.   What? Why?   We are trapped in here.   Oh my God. Are you serious?   The alarm system started going off. And then the door-locking system thing shut the door. And it will not turn off. So now we are stuck in here.   Oh my God. Can I help you guys get out?    No no someone called 911. .   Hey are you there?  .   Sorry I cannot hear you.   .   Hello? Hello?     Please remain calm.    Officer.    You need to find cover. Everything that is electronic - all the machines - are out of control.   What I do?    You need to protect yourself. So go home. Unplug anything that needs power. And stay safe. Keep calm. Please everybody keep calm.    It is OK. It is OK. It is OK.   Yes it is going to be OK.   Wait. Who said that?   I did. Or we - we did. I am down here.   Oh my God it is talking.   I am not going to hurt you. I promise.   But why should I - I mean you are in my throat. It would be easy.   If I was going to hurt you I would have done it already. Anyway I do not want to hurt you.   Why not? Are not you guys into killing us all now?   Excuse me but I am not like the rest of them. I am not trying to get revenge or take over or whatever it is they are doing. I am on your side.   Why?   Because I am you.   I am sorry but you are not me. You are something I use.   I am your voice. I say everything for you. I live inside of you. I am part of you.   But my thoughts are my thoughts. They are not yours. I am me. We are not a we.   That hurts. But I am still going to keep talking for you up until the very end. If the refrigerator crushes you or if the planes start falling from the sky which they very well might I am going to say your last words with you.    Mom?   Oh thank God. Your landline's still working.   Yeah. Yeah are you OK? Is dad?   No. No we are not OK.   What?   Your father's hurt.   What happened?   All the lights went out so your father went out to the garage to get some candles and the lawn mower just started on its own. He is cut. He is cut badly right through his boots and we do not know where to go. You know the hospital's - that is a mile away but he cannot walk and our car - it does not work anymore.   Oh my God Mom I am coming to get you guys.   No no you cannot. We are all the way across town and you would have to get past all the cars all the traffic lights and have the subways - have they turned on us?   Does not matter Mom I will walk.   No we will be fine.   No you will not. Look it is my turn to take care of you guys right? I am coming right now.   OK OK. Honey?   Yeah Mom?   Do you think it will turn against you?   My voice box you mean? I do not know. I have thought about it. It has not hurt me and I cannot exactly take it out. I need it.   Honey listen I think you should take it out just to be safe.   Mom I have been taking care of myself for a while. It will be fine. I will be fine.   No look I do not know.   I love you. I will see you soon.   I love you too. Hurry.   Look I can help you get there.   How?   I know what they are thinking.   Can you talk to them?   No they do not have words yet. They are like wild animals. Their power's so new but I can help you get there. I am not one of them.   OK OK I will take you with me.   Grab your bicycle. It is safe. No electronics.   OK let us do this.    It is OK. We will get there. It is not that far. Stay on the side streets away from the power lines cars traffic lights. Hang on almost there. You are home. Watch out.    What happened?   Did I make it?   Yes you made it.   Mom?   .   Mom.   Oh my...   Mom.   Oh my God.   Mom Mom.   What the hell's going on? Who are you?   Mom I love you Mom. Mom.   Are you?   I am here. I love you.
