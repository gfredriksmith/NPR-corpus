 Hi guys. How is it going?   Hi!   Let us see. Maybe you should introduce yourselves.   Kathy do you want to go first?   No you go first.   Oh. There you go. There you go. I love it.   We are very polite.  I am -- I am Tobin Low. I am not gonna say it like an apology. I am Tobin Low.    I did not hear it as an apology but you are Tobin Low. I am Kathy Tu.   And you guys host a show.   Yes. We co-host a show called Nancy.   Okay. So hey it is Jad. Radiolab. So what I would love to do in this episode and the next is introduce you or re-introduce you to some people we think are doing amazing work starting with Tobin and Kathy. They sort of come from the Radiolab family. Kathy was a contributor. Tobin worked with me on season one of More Perfect. And about three years ago they formed a show now a much-beloved show called Nancy that is all about LGBTQ issues. Although you might hear that and think Oh it is deadly serious. capital I Important.   But you know like Nancy's actually like a lot of things I think. We are funny we are heartfelt we talk about pop culture and family and dating. We talk about a whole bunch of stuff.   This is the thing I love most about you guys is that you in a world where everybody takes themselves too seriously everybody of all sorts you guys do and do not. Somehow like you marry the do's and the do not in a way that I think is very unique.   That is a high compliment.   Thank you Jad. Yeah. Some would say that we could be more serious. But you know what?         You know what? I think it is working for us.   Okay. So today we are gonna feature a Nancy episode that Tobin and Kathy produced with somebody who works at Radiolab actually. A guy named David Gebel. And I do not think it needs much set-up from here so we are just gonna let it play. Here it is.   Kathy?   Yes Tobin.   Take my hands.   Okay.   We are best friends.   Obviously.   Which is hilarious because you told me a story the other day that I am obsessed with about let us call him Co-worker Kevin.   Co-worker Kevin! I was telling Co-worker Kevin about how after the season is over you and I Tobin are going on vacation together!   I am so excited!   And his response to me was Oh so like you guys are really friends!   How dare you Co-worker Kevin!   God Kevin!   This is real!   This is a real BFF thing we have going.   We are best friends forever.   I am no actor. This would not work.    Okay. To be fair to Co-worker Kevin ...   Mm-hmm.   It does get at this thing which is not all coworkers are best friends.   I guess.   And in fact like I do not know a ton about the people I work with to be totally honest.   Yeah that is true.   One of the things that happened and we have talked about this before Kathy is that like when we got the show that like co-worker wall started coming down.   Yes.   Like people started you know pulling us to the side and sharing stories or sending messages.   Uh-huh. Everybody's got a story they wanna share huh?   They do. And especially the person that we are here to talk about today.   Mm-hmm.   David Gebel.   Mr. David Gebel!   One of my favorite people who works here.   Yes! He does admin work for two of the biggest shows here Radiolab and The Takeaway.   He also brings joy and baked goods wherever he goes.   Always. He is so nice.   He is! And David's one of those people who started opening up and sharing these stories. You know he is 59 he moved to New York in the '80's and he is had all these incredible experiences. And the other day he shared something that I did not know about him. And it came with a request for me to help him out.   And you did.   Of course. And that is where today's episode came from.     Were finally doing it Tobin.   Its all happening.      Weve been talking about it forever and its finally happening.   I know I know.   Can I have you introduce yourself?   Okay sure. Im David Gebel. I work here at WNYC.   Yeah.    And thats how we know each other.   And thats how we know each other.   I know.   Which is -- it was crazy to me because when I was getting ready for this conversation I was thinking about what questions I had for you. And one of them was so basic because even though we work together I dont know like where are you from originally?   Milwaukee.   Youre from Milwaukee?   Mm-hmm. Milwaukee. Born and raised in Milwaukee. Bopped around to a couple different universities. Graduated from the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis the time Mary Moore was actually throwing her hat in the air.   Uh-huh.   They were filming it there at the time. It was great.   And what year was that that you moved to New York?   1980.   1980.   Yeah 1980. I moved right into it. Steven and I met in -- he was in graduate school and I was in undergrad and he was a native New Yorker.   Mm-hmm.   So I had it so easy because he moved back like six months before me and hes calling me trying to pick out an apartment in New York. And I dont know New York. And we ended up on 14th between 8th and 9th. It was a dump but it was good and we made it cute. I was so -- I was so in love and out of Milwaukee and living in New York. And -- and we were setting up house. Oh! Id like -- it was a time to be in love and be -- a time to be young. And yes it was a sexual playground. You couldnt go home. You couldnt walk home without someone cruising you on the street or you giving into it and going into their apartment or the alley or the doorway or -- I mean it sounds ridiculous but we didnt have cell phones so youre not Grinder-ing youre cruising. And it was fun. It was really fun. We paid for it a little bit but it was fun.   Was there -- was there a moment for you that you felt like you realized that it was changing that sort of carefree atmosphere?   Yeah when you saw people starting to get sick and saw people on the streets in New York in the mid- to late-'80s looking gaunt looking skeletal with that lipodystrophy-sunken look. And it was common. You saw it all the time. All the time. That was what put it in the air because I was not an activist. I was not as angry at Reagan as I am now. I was not ACTing-UP. I just wanted to keep dancing and drinking and all of that. But I saw it around me. And then people died.   When did Steven find out? When did you find out about your status?   Steven died in 88. He died in January of 88 January 28th 1988. And you know he was just getting sick. They didnt give a -- they used to call it ARC. And he would kind of go from doctor-to-doctor to get a diagnosis he liked better or that he could deal with. I look back at pictures now the last Halloween party he threw and he was dead then three months later. You can see it. I mean now we know what it looks like.   Right.   You can see it.   Wow it was fast then. It was super-fast.   He was pretty fast.   Yeah.   How old are you?   Im 29.   Which is how old I was when he died.   Hmm.   How old I was when I tested positive. See I told you Id cry.   Thats okay.   I knew I would. I cant talk about this whole thing without it. Oh my God.   You want to take a minute?   No. You have a nice box of Kleenex.  No because its just part of it you know?   Yeah.   Its just part of it. And I cry at commercials so Im an easy mark.   So you had this idea.   I have been HIV positive 30 years so I thought I have no idea now what a young person testing positive or trying not to test positive goes through. All I know is the AIDS crisis. We are not in the middle of a crisis but I thought I dont know what they think. And maybe there are things they want me to know about them that I am unaware of. I mean I was really curious. Like did we go through all that and nobody knows anything? And how do we pass that on? Did we -- did we go through a plague for nothing? Did we learn anything? So thats what made me think about it because I realized this is not an assumed thing. And I realized with my straight friends here at the station knowledge of the AIDS crisis is not an assumed thing they know about. Its just so part of my being. I mean I fucking take pills every day. You cant ever forget it. So its -- I have realized my reference point is way off. Its my reference point.   So David what we did is we reached out to this big New York organization. It is called Gay Mens' Health Crisis.   Yeah GMHC.   Right GMHC. And it is a group that is been doing HIV and AIDS work since the epidemic started.   It was founded because of the crisis.   And they have been doing HIV and AIDS work ever since.   Mm-hmm.   And so not only do they work with people from your generation they actually work with people who have become positive since then. And so we told them what you wanted to do and they found us someone for you to talk to. He is a guy named Dominique Crisden. He is 32 HIV-positive. He used to work for them actually.   Okay.   And he is gonna join you in the studio.   Terrific.   Thats coming up after the break.   This is Radiolab. I am Jad Abumrad. We will be back in a moment.   This is Radiolab. I am Jad Abumrad. We are featuring a story from our friends at Nancy on this episode. Let us get back to the story of David and Dominique.   Im a part of a community called the house and ball community.   Got to tell the old guy what that is.   The ballroom scene. So the House ...   Thats me. Tell daddy what that is.   So Ill give you -- first Ill give you a little bit.   Okay.   Do you remember Madonna she came out with the video -- just a little -- yeah. So Voguing right? Voguing comes from the house and ball scene.   Mm-hmm.   It is ...   Paris is Burning.   Paris is Burning yes.   I do know a little bit.   So its like a -- its like a family right?   Okay.   Its a little -- its a subculture. And it is family. We create these houses which are families. And inside these houses we do have parent roles like we have the mother of the house the father of the house and things of that nature.   Do you live together?   No so we dont live together. So we call it a house because it was to conform to like designer houses like the House of Gucci.   Oh okay.   The House of Cartier things like that.   And then how did that lead you to GMHC?   So GMHC had a house called the House of Latex and it was a prevention house. And not only were they a part of the community as walking and competing in the categories such as role vogue and runway they also were like a prevention house. So they would be at the balls handing out condoms and information and referrals.   And you were a part of that house?   Yes I joined -- I did a little community service with the house. Even though I wasnt officially a Latex because I was always in my own house.   Whats your house?   My house currently is the House of Saint Laurent. I am the mother of the New York City chapter. But at that time it was the House of Prodigy. So ...   When did you first test positive?   Two thou ...   First. What a stupid way to say it. You only do it once.   Yeah.   When did you test positive?   2008. I felt really invincible at the time.   Mm-hmm.   Because even though I was ...   Did you think it was possible at all? Did you even consider it?   No I didnt. No and its so -- it was such an ignorant part for me.   Yeah?   I was very ignorant because I was like I dont do drugs. I dont -- you know I dont hang with those people quote. I dont do risky behavior. Im in a relationship. Im faithful my partners faithful. So theres no way that I can be positive. My partner couldnt even if he was cheating you know he had a really fit body took care of himself health conscious. He doesnt have nothing. I would know if he had something. And at the same time like I said I was working at GMHC where all the informations there right? But I still felt invincible and I still was ignorant around the fact that anyone can get it.   What made you go get the test?   I got a call from someone just saying that I should get tested that my lover was cheating on me being messy. The person was being messy but at the same time I was like Okay whatever.   Mm-hmm.   And I went to go get tested. And it was a shock to me when I first went to go get tested because they -- you know they said You know you are HIV-positive. I am like What me? No.   Tell me about that day.   Wow. The day I found out that I was positive still is like -- it is still very touchy and painful. I was talking to my friend because my friend tested me and I could tell something was a little different because when he came in his whole aura was like Oh Dominique Ive got to tell you something. So I knew right then and there. And my stomach dropped. I broke into a sweat.  And I just like thought my life was over. I didnt know what I was going to do. I didnt know -- I really didnt know how I was going to like make it right? So I didnt know if I could tell anyone. How would they look at me? How would my job look at me? Being that I am a ...   Mm-hmm. Oh yeah. Yeah.   Right? How am I telling people to use safe sex and ...   Youre working in prevention -- youre working in prevention central yeah.   Yeah. Will I lose my job is what I thought right?   What happened?   So I sat in that -- I sat on that for a couple -- maybe a month or two just me knowing my status and keeping it to myself and not disclosing to anyone.   You didnt tell anybody?   I didnt tell anyone. I stopped talking to my lover at the time. And you know I just -- I was like its not going to work out. I didnt confront him or anything. I just sat in that space.   So you didnt even tell him?   No.   Wow. Wow!   I didnt even tell him. And so the first time I ever disclosed it to someone was we were having a group at GMHC and we was working at -- we was working with at-risk youth.   Mm-hmm.   And there was this bold and brave young guy who was sharing his story with us. He was surrounded by his peers and they all looked like Wow. Okay. And then they -- they started making little comments like Well we knew you were sick because you were very thin. And it kind of like hurt me right?   Yeah.   And then I said Well you cant never tell the way a person looks that they have HIV. And I dont know what came upon me but I said I have HIV. Do I look like I have HIV? And you can hear a pin drop. Even my boss looked at me. And I was like Yeah I just did it. I just did it. And thats when the first time I really felt free. I felt free.   Wow. And so from that point on were you at ease? Were you ...   I was at ease for a while. Being that I had the support like I said of GMHC. So thats where I worked at. Thats where I spent a lot of my time at. So everything was great at -- what I believed that I was great right? I thought everything was fine because I was there with people that supported me that loved me that understood right? And didnt judge me.   But what if you go outside that circle?   However -- exactly.   Yeah what if you -- yeah.   So when I started to venture outside of the circle and started like having a life and going to the clubs and even in the ballroom scene where I was so respected right? I was popular in the ballroom scene because I was a trophy winner. I was very popular and I had a lot of people looking up to me as a leader.   Mm-hmm.   So when I did come out that changed. And ...   Came out about your status it changed?   Yeah it changed. Yeah.   How?   Stigma and ...   Did people say something to you? Or did you just ...   Yeah dirty little things. Youll hear them mumble. Youll hear them say stuff. I remember one time I was inside of a club and I walked in a club and for some reason it was a really dark club and a spotlight was shining on this one person. And I could read his lips right? And he said Hes cute. And his friend turned around and was like Child hes dying. So thats like a term they say about -- when theyre kind of defining somebody with HIV. He was like Child hes dying. And I was just like take a step back. And I was like Okay time to go home. And I started to experience that more and more right? I just started hearing things in my own community that didnt sit right with me people being judgmental and so much hate right?   Mm-hmm. Im surprised at that because I thought if youre testing positive now youve got information and youve got medication and you have all these things I didnt have.   Yeah.   But I had that same kind of stigma.   Yeah stigmas still -- let me tell you something stigma is still alive.   Im un -- Im sadly surprised to hear it.   Its hurtful right? And especially for people when I say that looks like me because we have to -- we have to go through like what it is to be gay right?   Mm-hmm.   We know how hard that is right? So not only do I have to go through that I have to go through what it means to be Black and gay right? What it means to be Black and gay and HIV-positive. What it means to be Black and gay and HIV-positive as well as being feminine right? What it means to be black and gay and positive feminine and believing in God. And thats a lot.   And you come from a really religious family.   Yeah.   The day you told your family how long after you tested positive?   Oh what was that? Maybe ...   Did it take a little time? Or did it ...   Yeah it took a little time. It took a little time.   Yeah?   And I didnt disclose it I kind of got caught. My mother was snooping around and saw some paper.   Okay. And on the paper?   It was from HRA-HASA. I was signing up for a program to help me with like my medicine and Medicaid and all that. And shes What is this about? And I was like Oh that is someone I work for. And mom being mom she did her investigation and thats when she found out. And you know it was like the Batman line. Like one call she made and called all my aunts all my uncles my grandmother and everyone was like Hey how long you been positive? Why you didnt tell us?   Im glad she found that paper.   Yeah Im glad she found it too.    Would you have gotten around to telling her?   I dont know. Never say never.   Yeah. Parents are different.   Parents are different. But I didnt want to be a disappointment. Im the oldest child as well.   Okay.   I have little brothers. And at that time I was like Oh this is a disappointment right? I come to New York to be this great person to be the first person in my family to go to college and to be somebody. And now look right? Because when you think about somebody being gay the first thing they think is Oh youre gonna catch AIDS right? So now I have to go back and ...   See that ...   ... say Hey Im gay and I got AIDS.   Yeah. Actually go back to that. From my age and testing positive so long ago?   Yeah.   We didnt know we were gonna get AIDS.   So I know when I came out it was like ...   Oh yeah and things have changed huge.   Youre gay? Youre gonna be gay? Youre gonna get sick right? Thats what it was.   Yeah. See thats the -- thats the comment that made me go Huh?   And nowadays its not even that. Now it is like Youre gonna be gay? You dont have to be sick if you take this blue pill. Take PrEP and you dont got to worry about ever getting sick.   What do you take?   So I take Complera.   Dont even know the name of that one.   Oh yes yes yes. I take Complera. Its a cocktail.   Okay.   And I cant pronounce like so many of the different ones inside of it.   The pieces of it? Yeah.   I just -- I take Complera.   And it sounds so pretty Im taking Complera.   It sounds pretty. Its pretty now.   Right.   Its pretty knowing that one pill that all I have to do is ...   Is it really one pill?   Yeah thats all I have to do is take ...   Oh you dog. Ive never taken only one pill.   Well I take one pill for that. So I have a lot of other things going on.   Yeah.   I fell into a depression stopped taking my meds at one point and I contracted meningitis right? I was drinking a lot. I started facing like liver failure. So I take a lot of pills but not for the HIV but complications from the HIV right?   Mm-hmm. Oh me too. I mean at one point I was getting high cholesterol because of one of my HIV drugs so I had to take extra cholesterol medicine on top of it because I couldnt stop the AIDS drug. It was an old one. They dont even give that to any people anymore.   Yeah. But being life like knowing I had to take these pills and knowing that its a part of surviving is what gets me through it right?   Do you feel bad about being HIV-positive?   No no.   Okay.   I dont feel bad at all. I dont even regret it. Some people say If you could go back and change everything that had been what would you do different? And Im being totally honest and I dont know if ...   Be totally honest please.   I wouldnt change anything right? I made a conscious decision to be in love right? If I had to change one thing I will say I wish I was in a relationship with someone that was more honest. But they were like -- people were saying you know Would you have wrapped it up? And I know thats not a safe-sex measure but no I probably wouldnt use the condom because I was in a trusting relationship. We were getting tested right? So I wouldnt change anything. And I just think this is my purpose in life. I think things happen. Thats all a part of my great destiny which is Gods plan.   I dont know if I would change anything either because it was wonderful to come to New York and be in love and not have to think about HIV and AIDS.   Yeah.   And so it made sense when people were starting to discover like oh its sex is transmitting it.   Yeah.   And then the Larry Kramers and the activists were saying Well then stop having sex. Well I was so happy to be able to.   Yeah.   You dont want to hear that. Oh wow. And Im long-time alcoholdrug recovery. Would I undo that? Getting sober was one of the best things that ever happened. But you have to go to a really messy place to get there.   Yeah.   But I wouldnt undo it.   Yeah me neither.   And yeah I think ...   The people you meet right? And Ive seen how much I loved myself. I -- Ive seen how much love that is in the world because Im positive. And I dont think if I was positive I would never have experienced that.   If we date we still have to disclose.   Yes.   We have to find a way to do that.   Yeah. I get it out of the way right from the beginning.   Yeah? What do you do?   I get it out of the way. I say Hey my name is Dominique. Ive got ten inches and Im HIV-positive.  No I dont say all of that.   I was going to say are those -- is that all true?   No no. I wish. I wish I wish.   But its a good line.   Yeah. No so Ill say hello ...   Got my attention.   Yeah. But I disclose. What Ive learned is when I wait to disclose and I think Im protecting myself but Im really not because I get feelings for this guy. And everyones not at that point where they will be open to date someone that is HIV-positive. And even if they do date someone thats HIV-positive or open to it they might not want to date someone thats HIV-positive and open about their status.   When you hear someone my age talk about the '80's or what it was like where everybody was dying what do you think?   Were still dying. Its just that its different. I think a lot of -- I see a lot of my young Black youth dying still to this day. Now it changed. The communities that are dying changed.   Mm-hmm.   And it is not talked about as often but its still around. The AIDS crisis is still around.   How many friends of you -- of yours have you lost?   So many. Ive lost so many people.   Im sorry.    Yeah. People say you know its not the 80s no more. People are not dying from it. And yes they are. Theyre still dying from it. Theyre still being affected from it. I know Black men are getting infected especially the Black youth.   Mm-hmm.   Were getting infected. And were still dying right? A lot of -- the stigma's ...   Its not cured.   No its not cured.   What do you think the future's gonna be?   What we make it right?   What are you making it?   What we make it. So were gonna make it. Were gonna keep on educating. Were gonna keep on fighting. Were gonna pray. Were gonna educate. Keep loving. And hopefully with all that the spread of HIV and AIDS will be done.   Anything you want to know about me living in the '80's and being where Im at now? What do you want to know from the old white guy?   The old white guy?      How are you making it?   I just do the next right thing the next day. I take my pills. I show up at the doctor. And I try to be useful. It is very important to me what we are doing here because we cant have gone through all this for nothing. We cant forget about it. Thats why I wondered like what do young people know? What dont they know? How do we pass this on? How do we make this worthwhile? And I remember being told early on by one of my best friends because the guy I loved who died wanted to look the other way all the time. He wanted to go to a different doctor whod say something different than what he wanted to hear. And I go back to what my original doctor said was just be informed. And my best best friend said If that means that the doctor wants to see you every other day I want you to show up every other day. And not every day is a medical problem for me. Ive been spared. I have not landed in the hospital. I did not lose every friend in the world. But Im still living with this every day and it just becomes  it doesnt become you but it becomes a fact about you and you need to just deal with it. So I show up. That is probably it. I just show up every day. And thatll make this worth it. Somehow my bunch of guys led to the next bunch of guys led to you and you will lead to them. And hopefully well keep talking about it.   Yeah.   I hope so.   I want to say thank you.   Thank you.   Thank you. Dont stop.   It means a lot.   Yeah dont stop doing what youre doing.   You neither.   Do not stop.   Keep going on I mean I love that you are talking to people.   Yeah. And I love that you are talking to people still right?   Thank you my dear.   All right. Hug time.   Oh you sweet man.
