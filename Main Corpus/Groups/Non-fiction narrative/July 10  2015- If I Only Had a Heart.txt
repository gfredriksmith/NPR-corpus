 The first thing that they want to ask me after they stop staring is how it happened. How did you do that to yourself? At first I told the folks the truth. But when they looked away I understood that no one cared what I said. They just wanted to hear that it was my fault - that I did something wrong because if I did not - if this just happened to me it could happen to them too. But I could not oblige because one does not simply grab an axe and cut off their own legs and replace them with metal. It is not done. And after I remember thinking that getting rid of my arms - that too was a good idea - that metal arms would be far superior. And if metal arms why not a whole metal torso? Only after I had removed my head and replaced it with a shiny new one fashioned of tin to match the rest of my physique then went to visit my lady fair and saw the look of horror in her eyes - only then did I realize that I would been bewitched. But as she screamed and waved her hands about I understood as well that - well that I did not care about her anymore. I wondered why. Perhaps it was because I had neglected to get a heart - perhaps. But I did care. I do care about whomever bewitched me because it seems as if they have stolen something from me - something that I used to treasure and I want it back. So I am going to name this episode after myself. They call me the tin man.
