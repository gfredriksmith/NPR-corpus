 PART 1   Before we start this podcast contains some tape that describes some pretty graphic violence. We want to let you know that before we get going.     Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today ...   We are gonna start this show with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay Times.   He is a guy we have had on the show before.   Ben say something.   Hi. This is Ben.   Hi Ben. Okay I think we are good. All right. We just want to know from you like what are you guys doing? How are you doing it? What are you thinking?   I will start at the beginning.   Yeah. Start at the beginning tell us what you are doing.   So after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson ...     When that became a national story there was a lot of bellyaching in the press ...     ... about ...     ... how no one keeps accurate statistics ...     ...on police shootings law enforcement officer-involved shootings. And it struck me at the time that like what we react to is all anecdotal. You know once in a while one of these things will catch fire.           And will become sort of a national story. And I personally was having trouble like processing that. Like number one is there -- is it trending one way or the other? Are police shooting more Black people than white people? Just very simply.   Yeah.   The problem is we do not know. We have no idea because nobody tracks these. FBI does not. State agencies do not for the most part.   Really?   So that -- that data does not exist somewhere within the police department itself?   In the police department it does on the local level. However it does not exist in any accurate way by a broader agency. And I could tell you how many purse snatchings there were in Florida in 2011 using the FBI numbers or the numbers submitted to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement but I cannot tell you how many times police shot somebody.   Now there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally.   But everything that is done so far is incomplete.   You know because most of those you know like The Guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports so they are only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness.   That is right.   So Ben and his editors thought ...   Let us do something that is more complete. Let us do something that is unprecedented.   So first thought he had ...   Florida.   It is the third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country.   And Florida has wonderful public records laws.   Legally it is easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places. And so Ben sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida.   I think I sent 388 emails asking for five years' worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired a firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting. Now this involved a year of work.   Hounding police departments. Getting lawyers involved.   This is a massive thing that involved probably no less than a hundred people.   But eventually ...   Thank you sir.   Ben put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of.   A while back we sent our producer Matt Kielty down to the Tampa Bay Times ...   Oh is this them right here?   ... to check it out.   Yeah.   How many -- how many documents do you think you have sitting on this desk?   It is probably 5000 pages. I have a stack of paper that is about as tall as me. Six feet tall. We got them broken down by county but you can see -- so A B Bay County Boca Raton Boynton Beach all the way through the alphabet.   Yeah you basically just have all these manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across an entire desk.   Right. It is a combination of Use of Force Reports civil court records and media clippings that represent 831 shootings. I hope every shooting in the State of Florida in the -- in six years' time 2009 to 2014. So what we did was go through all this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could get that we thought was useful. Circumstantial stuff. Did it involve a SWAT team? Did it involve an armed suspect? Was there a chase? All the demographic information for the firing officer or officers and the people who were hit by those bullets. Then we thought Let us like learn from these. Let us see how -- how we can compile the data and build a database and you know hopefully draw some conclusions some lessons some solutions.   This is all gonna go into sort of a giant online database at the Tampa Bay Times website. Hopefully other organizations in other states will start to do the same. Perhaps even one day we will have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff. In any case in the meantime here's some of the things that Ben found. And initially some of it you know kind of surprised us.   Well the biggest sort of counter-intuitive line in this the numbers are flat.   He says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year ...   The numbers have stayed steady.   About 130 people shot by police every year.   Which seems odd because you know the past couple of years these videos that go viral and makes it seem like this is a new and intense problem. The numbers show that that does not seem to be the case.   Huh.   We also broke these down into category and ...   He says you know what you see like on the most basic level are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is quote mentally unstable.   And this is a case we are not taking a guess at whether the person is mentally unstable. These are cases in which there is some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill.   Maybe off their meds at the time of the shooting.   And in that category Ben says they found a surprising number of cases they call suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually mentally ill is apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally.   The person is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police. Either a weapon or what they want the police to think is a weapon.   So it is called I am gonna kill myself but I am gonna make you do it to me.   Right.   And that is considered a suicide attempt because they know they are gonna get shot. It is an attempt to invite the shooting.   That is right.   This is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well.   You know they are the news briefs that you see once or twice a week.   But it was news to us. I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country. But when it got to Ben's central question what do the numbers say about race?   I think I would start with the fact that ...   There I am not sure it was so surprising.   That 40 percent of people shot by police are Black. And that is -- that is out of whack with the Florida demographics.   What is the percentage of African Americans in Florida?   It is not 40 percent.   It is more like 17.   That is right.   Which means ultimately that if you are a Black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you are white.   This does not tell us much right now but the breakdown between fatalities for those same demographics ...   And as we sat there going through this particular set of numbers ...   50.9 percent were carrying a firearm 9 percent had a blade. 70 percent involved some form of resisting arrest.   You know and we talked with him numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers. And as we were doing that ...   50.9 percent.   You know it was weird. I started to feel like you know I am really glad that we have these numbers finally. That in itself is a good thing but ...   Further down 91 of the 570 or 16 ...   The numbers themselves do not really get you very far. The more you hear it is just like yeah this is only one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem.   Yeah. I mean -- I mean what gets me is like the -- I do not know. It is back to where we were and why we wanted to start this. I am still just moved by this single case the individual cases. And it is hard to remember that each of these is you know -- I mean they are all written in this Deployment Investigations revealed that ASPD officer Matthew Fowler received a call -- in this staccato sterile police speak. Fowler approached apartment 255 and was confronted by a white male later identified as Anthony Skiles armed with a knife at apartment 255. Every one of these every report is at least one human life. Someone was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed. So we have on this table the investigation of the deaths or severe injury of 831 people.   So what we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay Times is we grabbed a couple of folders right off Ben Montgomery's giant folder stack to follow wherever those stories might lead.   Matt Kielty and Ben traveled around Florida on a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard. And over the next couple of weeks we are gonna bring you two of those stories. This podcast is the first. Matt I guess we will just turn it over to you.   Yep. Okay so day one?   Yeah. Where was this place again?   DeLand. DeLand Florida.   It is a town. It is hot. It is probably low eighties.   A little town on the east coast of Florida and we were there because Ben had found out about this event.   Do you even know what the thing is called?   It is the third -- they call it Celebration. The third anniversary celebration of the police killing of Marlon Brown.   Okay.   And this event was being held at ...   The West Volusia Shrine Club.   Shrine Club.   Shrine Club.   Like Shriners?   Like the Shriners.   I am just gonna walk in and introduce myself.   So I walk in and you know it is like a small community center.   Linoleum floor fluorescent lights.   And the first thing I noticed to be honest was there were about 20 people in here mostly Black who are just milling about talking. But on the walls of this place ...   The photos of all the Shriners run the length of this wall.   It is just like portraits of old white men wearing fez hats who were all the former Shriner presidents.   It is just old white dudes with names like George Seeger Gunther Warbling. Oh so ...   And as I was taking in this scene this woman came up to me who was hosting the event. Her name was Krystal Brown.   I do -- I try to do something like this once a year for Marlon's anniversary.   Tall black woman long dreads and these very piercing hazel eyes.   And your relation to Marlon?   Ex-wife. We was high school sweethearts since we -- I was 15.   And I do not know Marlon's story. I do not ...   Marlon is -- three years May 8th. It was 30 in the morning and he was allegedly being stopped for not wearing his seat belt. And so he did not stop. He got out of his car and he ran. He was on I guess some kind of community control where he was supposed to be home by 00.   He was on probation for a drug charge. He had been caught with some painkillers. So he ran and immediately the cop car followed him. And eventually Marlon slipped fell. The cop car hit him.   Going 24 miles per hour. Ran into him. He was pinned under the car for about four or five hours.   Four or five hours?   Yeah.   When Krystal and some neighbors got out to the scene ...   We sat out there and waited four or five hours until they were able to get the car off of him.   Marlon was pronounced dead. And so Krystal and I talked for a little bit and ...   You do not mind if I sit and join you for a minute? Is that okay?   I sort of just walked around started introducing myself to people.   Where are you guys from in Florida?   Tampa Florida.   Oh you are from Tampa. Okay so we just made the drive ...   I do not quite know what I was expecting. I guess I just thought it was you know gonna be a local event for this one person. But as I started to meet people I started to meet people from all over. From Tampa from Palm Beach ...   Whereabouts in New York are you?   I mean there were people from all over the country.   East Flatbush.   Brooklyn Chicago Georgia. And ...   Yes this is for my son Tonorris.   I started seeing these people who were wearing these t-shirts.   A pink shirt and then you have two doves ...   With a big picture of a young Black man's face or a name.   This it represent angels watching over.   There was one woman with a picture of her son's eighth grade graduation photo on her shirt.   It is his cap and gown in red.   He was 14 years old when he was killed.   He was also buried in this same cap and his gown.   And then another mother ...   This is going on the fourth year. So I have maybe about six or seven.   Who had the name of her 23-year-old son Rodney Mitchell on her shirt.   I have one with his graduation picture on it. I have like a fluorescent black and yellow one. I have this Jamaican color one. I have a black and white. I have different shirts. Oh yeah.   And I started seeing shirt after shirt after shirt. And I would say by the time like 40 people had showed up and there is all these different shirts I just realized like oh this is not just a thing for one person. This is a network. Like almost everyone there had lost either a cousin or a brother or a husband even -- even a daughter to police violence.   Hmm.   And in fact when I later spoke to one of those women you just heard ...   I have one with his graduation picture on it.   Her name is Natasha Clemens. Her 23-year-old son Rodney Mitchell he was shot and killed by police during a traffic stop. We are actually gonna get into that story later. But she told me that ...   I have met about 400 other mothers. They have reached out to me and I ...   400?   Oh yes.   Really?   Yeah. Through like traveling around through Facebook.   I have met 400 other mothers who is lost their children.   Wow.   And so I was just seeing like a fraction of that at this community center.   God the scale is surprising.   Right. And the other thing for me was how you see these stories pop up.     At least the ones that get pulled up to like a national level and you see the family members come out ...     And for like two days you see them on television.     And then they kind of recede and they are gone. And I guess what I thought is you know probably they have these long drawn-out legal battles and then you know they go back to their lives whatever -- whatever that means. But instead it is like oh no. What happens is they get like folded up into this network.   And we pray for those mostly that will be coming to this family ...   And so at the community center there was a moment of prayer where the 40 to 50 people sat down at these big round dining tables.   ... because once upon a time ago there was no coalition like we have today. There was no way to know what to do. There was no group telling you how to get justice or how to make change and how to protect our kids and our loved ones. And we ask these prayers and all prayers in God's name. Amen.   And so after the prayer Krystal hollered from the back of the room for everybody to eat. So everyone stood up and then the vibe just totally changed and somebody put on some MJ. And a lot of people started to crowd around these two big picnic tables.   Do you ladies mind just ...   I am not gonna make not one comment until I eat.   Oh no no no. No comment.   Which is where I met this woman.   I mean the only comment I was looking for was if you could just describe for me what we got on the table because I am just ...   What is on the table?   Yeah just what is on the table.   You mean this table?   This table right here.   So I think you have tea you have sweet tea you have orange juice and then you have your condiments for that. But on the breakfast table over there ...   What is on -- what is on ...?   You have got your eggs. You have got your grits. You have got your bacon. You have got your sausage. You got everything you want to have to get nice good and full on today. So I am excited.   Can I get your name?   Sure. Geneva Reed-Veal. I am the mother of Sandra Bland.   In case you do not remember. July 10 2015.     Sandra Bland is pulled over in a small town in Texas. The cop runs her information comes back to the car.                                         Eventually Sandra gets out of the car.             Sandra was eventually taken to jail. Four days later in that jail cell she was found dead hanged with the plastic garbage bag. The death was ruled a suicide and Sandra's family disputed that ruling.   You got everything you want to have to get nice good and full on today. So I am excited.   Can I get your name?   Sure. Geneva Reed-Veal. I am the mother of Sandra Bland.   Sandra Bland.   Yeah.   Where are you coming from?   Chicago.   I want to let you eat your food. One thing I wanted to ask have you come -- have you come to events like this before?   Oh yes sir. Quite a few. I was in Missouri last week. We go all around. We try to support as many mothers as we can because it is important.   And is that -- is that exactly like is that what it is? Is it really just like a support group?   Yes sir. It is support because that mother who has lost their baby needs to be able to see somebody else who looks like them who is in the same situation that they are as opposed to someone walking up to them and saying I know how you feel but you really do not.   Which made me think about something Ben and I had talked about a lot which is in getting to meet these women and talk to these women you get the sense that their -- their experience is this really unique sort of loss.   It sucks to lose somebody to cancer. I have lost a friend to cancer recently in fact. It is a horrible thing and a very -- you know ten times a hundred times worse for his -- for his wife and children than it is for me. I think it is a different thing when your person is killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun and a badge in a -- you know in a position of authority.   And this is something you do see in Ben's numbers. Even though the numbers themselves they cannot really tell you whether or not a shooting was -- was legally justified what is clear is that over 800-plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer has ever been charged. So it is this weird sort of like double grief.   Yeah it is like past and present at the same time.   Like you cannot put it away because it is -- every day is another insult kind of.   Right.   As soon as something happens ...   Again this is Krystal Brown.   Somebody one of us is reaching out. Whoever is like closest. Like say if something happened in you know here in Florida. Florida we are gonna reach out to each other and then we are going to invite them in. We say this is like the club that nobody really wants to be a part of. It is crazy but this is family. I said family is more than just blood. This is my family and I could not have made it this far. I could not still be fighting I would not be doing anything if it was not for them.   So after the event ended at the community center Krystal took a bunch of the moms they all got in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop.   Is this like do you guys do this after every -- every event? Or is this just like Krystal knows this one?   No. No this is Krystal knows this one's around here and has been telling everyone about this.   This is Deandra Joseph. Her son Andrew died in 2014.   So no we did not know anything about this but figured this must be part of the different type of learning.   This is a part of just coping and grieving?   Right. Right. We are all just simply trying to find our way.   And so Krystal gathered like probably 15 of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like Here's how I cope or Here's how I deal with my grief.   You can either get the large sage.   At a certain point Krystal was talking to these two women and she just had this big bundle of sage in her hand.   Yeah because like if you want to do like your house like a -- like a -- like some deep shit. Then I open my windows and I just really -- I go through my house.   She says the sage calms her down.   Yeah. I am just ...   And then they went from the gem shop over to Krystal's house. Midsize one-story house in DeLand. And a lot of the women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking to Ben about his story. Krystal and her cousin were in the kitchen cooking up chicken. And one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together they like -- they bring with them their own stories these stories of grief of suffering. And yet when they are in the same room together it is like they just -- they just have fun. Apparently the night before they would all gone out dancing together. There was some Earth Wind  Fire.   And now what we are doing instead of getting motel rooms ...   Again this is Natasha Clemens.   We are starting to stay over at each other's houses. We sleep in each other's bed on each other's couch you know air mattresses. It becomes like a huge sleepover. And -- versus us going to sleep we are up talking you know getting to know each other and you know telling stories about each other's children so it is like therapy for us.   Vicky's letting me pass.   But there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really stuck with me.   I believe we are at the site of Marlon Brown's death.   And it was when Krystal led some of us over to the site where her ex-husband Marlon was hit by that squad car.   It is like -- it is about 12 people here.   And about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or a brother or a child. And we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking through this patchy grass.   So when you see the video that street that we just came down that is the video. That is the street that he turned Marlon turns here. And he comes here. Marlon's car was probably over like right there. And then the police car that came behind him was probably right here and then the officer that hit -- that hit him came in. And then we can walk. We came in -- he came right here. And that is why we -- they call it the execution in the vegetable garden because the garden was here.   And vegetables were growing and all that.   They had onions then because when they -- when they -- you know when they took him away and released him and took down the tape and stuff and we came back here that is all you could smell was onions. And so now like when you cut -- like it is not -- it is not as bad now but just the association. Like so when I am cutting onions you get that smell? Like it just -- you get those ...   It just brings you right back here?   Mm-hmm. Yep.   And the 12 of us just kind of stood there for a minute. Krystal's eyes were starting get teary. Some of the other women started to cry. And then ...   You all want me to take some ...?   Yeah my phone as not the best. Somebody with a better phone than me?   A couple women handed me their phones. And it is probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face.   All right three two one. And then let me -- three two one. All right. I think we got them.   Then we all started walking back up to the cars.   Krystal I just want to thank you for just sharing that with us because I know it has to be pretty hard to even come back to the site.   Yeah. Yeah we have not been out here in a long -- it is been a while. We will go to the gravesite. We still go there once a week. At night. Three oclock in the morning. That is why I remember Dee and I used to tell you all the time How do you live so far away from him? Oh my gosh that would -- that would ...   Yeah. My son's grave is about 15 minutes tops from where I live.   It is hard but every time I visit home I have to go there and spend some time.   Of course. Of course. How could you not right? And it as not no quickie. Like like you want to go take a chair.   Uh-huh. And sit there.   Yeah. And it is crazy because like it is a -- it is a cemetery like a little bit further out and it is crazy. You can go by there like a certain time every day and it is this little old white man with his chair. Everything like set up. Like he literally I think he -- does he like go have lunch with her every day? Like that has to be -- I do not know. It is the cemetery that is way out like going towards Popeye's and all of that. And it is a little white guy that is always sitting out there. He take his chair. Like he has a whole little setup.   So that trip to Florida was almost about a year ago.   Uh-huh.   And I felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip Geneva Reed-Veal who was the mother of Sandra Bland who I met she spoke at the Democratic National Convention.     She was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother.     And it was around this time that a few of these women started to call themselves The Mothers of the Movement.     Some of them showed up at the Women's March in DC.     and families to hear it! Mothers ...     And was weird because in this short amount of time this thing that we had stumbled into this thing that really kind of felt like at the time a support group had suddenly become a force.   Coming up.     A cop with a gun a man with a knife.     And a look at the razor-thin life-or-death moment between them.     So stay with us.       Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   And just -- let us just pick right back up with our story from Florida.   With Tampa Bay Times reporter Ben Montgomery and our own Matt Kielty.   All right so day two. Day two was Daytona.   53. May 3rd.   Daytona Beach?   Daytona Beach.   That is about everything.   And what happened was we went to this thing with these women mostly Black who have lost people to police violence. And I am sitting across the table from an African-American city councilman of Daytona Beach and I told him what I would been working on. I told him some of the numbers we would learned and he said You really need to meet our police chief.   You guys want me to run down and get a shower since you guys are ...   His name is Mike Chitwood.   You are not filming you are just interviewing?   No. Just -- yeah just a microphone that is all. Okay.   He is the police chief of Daytona Beach.   Known for its wild and raucous spring break scenes. They have Bike Week that draws 500000 bikers from all over the country and Daytona International Speedway. And on top of that the permanent population there is like 62000 people. And over that six-year period they have only had four police shootings.   Hmm. And that is low?   Yeah for a city like that that is really low.   Jesse I need to break down for 2015 ...   And in fact while we were there ...   ... by race of tickets and arrests.   Chitwood had his assistant print out these spreadsheets.   There we go.   Oh those are the stats?   Yeah.   Thank you.   You will not even have to do the math.   And these spreadsheets are actually kind of fascinating because if you look at them ...   You know you just can go right down here and you can add them up.   ... for things like aggravated assault theft shoplifting speeding ...   Our arrest ratio and our ticket ratio basically mirrors our city.   In terms of racial demographic.   Yeah. We are -- we are roughly a 6040 city. 60 percent white 40 percent African American.   And so when you look at these numbers that is pretty much what you see tickets for speeding about 60-40 arrests for theft about 60-40.   That is the way we are supposed to in theory approach the law.   And so what are they doing differently?   Well ...   A whole bunch of things. First of all ...   When all these -- these incidents were occurring in -- around the country with Ferguson and everything else we did a race and policing mandatory training for the entire PD. And basically what we wanted our officers to do is number one learn the history of the country. Because the history of the country is that we are a racist nation no matter how you want to look at it. Started with moving the Indians off of their lands for Manifest Destiny. When you look at Jim Crow laws when you look at the Civil War when you look at slavery when you look at Bull Connor for example of turning the dogs and fire hoses loose on civil rights marchers. So it is important for officers to understand that that you may go into an African American community and you may think and act and talk a way where you think you are being respectful and understanding but in reality you are not. But let us not for a moment think that there is not bias in policing because there is bias. We all have bias in us. And the trick is and I do not know if it is a trick and I do not know if any of us know how to contain that. How do we stop that bias from coming through when you make a decision?   Right. And I think and you know I have read a lot about implicit bias and always seems like -- it is like it feels like a kinder way to say fear. Like a fear of a Black person and that fear is greater than what you would feel when you are encountering a white person when you are out on the job as a cop.   When you look at some of the shootings they record on video and I think of the poor school janitor who lost his life in Minnesota.   Yeah the Philando Castile shooting. Yeah.   There is a guy who told the officer in no uncertain terms I am a good guy. I have a gun permit. You cannot get a gun permit if you are a convicted felon. You cannot get a gun permit if you are a drug dealer. So in the minute that young man tells that officer I have a gun permit for some unknown reason that officer's threat level with a baby in the car and I got a guy with his kid his girlfriend in the car and he is telling him he is a gun permit holder this is -- this is an easy car stop. For some reason and the reason is because of the color of the man's skin all of those things never registered. Black guy reaching for his black -- his pocket and I shoot him. And I would like to tell you in all my years in policing I would like to sit here and be naive and tell you that we do not shoot unarmed people. As a 28-year practitioner of law enforcement a second-generation cop I am appalled at what I see on those videos. I cannot believe that my profession in some cases is that out of control. Some of them I understand what is going on. I mean you are wrestling on the ground for your life and you know there are times that we have to use deadly force but the incidents in South Carolina the incident in Minnesota I mean are you kidding me? And you are looking at what are we doing?   I mean how do you -- how do you train that out of an officer so that when they make a traffic stop they are not already operating with this level of heightened fear or this perceived threat?   In my opinion number one you have to train tactically sound. You have to train using real life scenarios that take that extra split second before you fire your weapon. And I will give you an anecdote very quickly. When I first joined the Philadelphia Police Department we were shooting people at a crazy rate on an accidental discharge. The officer had their finger on the trigger. When they would go to grab that person if that person pulled or moved you would jerk back and it was a natural reaction to squeeze the trigger. So they sent us all back up to the police academy and we all had to be retrained on how to keep your finger on the side plate of the weapon not on the trigger so if that happened you would not accidentally trip and fire and shoot somebody. And you might have thought it was Armageddon. Oh my God they are gonna get us killed. When in reality what it did was it slowed down your field of vision. It slowed everything down. That split second did not make a difference and that blink of an eye did not make a difference. It made a difference in you not shooting because that split second let you see what you thought may have been the color of my glass coming out -- my cellphone was a cell phone.   So you buy yourself a little bit of time.   Hmm.   And this is the thing that Chitwood comes back to again and again is this idea of time.   In certain situations slow down. When you are dealing with a mentally-ill person slow down.   Like whatever you can do use cover just create some space to buy yourself another 30 seconds.   That extra 30 seconds may be the difference between saving your life and somebody else's life.   Another interesting thing was Ben -- Ben found this out also through some of his reporting with other police chiefs is the idea that some police chiefs do not like to hire kids out of high school like 19- 20-year-olds in part because ...   Everything they do is this.   They text a lot?   That is all they know to communicate is like this. And then when they look up and go to talk to somebody and I am serious about going through the drive-thru at McDonald's and they could piss off the person ordering a cheeseburger. How they -- how did you do it? It is just their demeanor. It is just the way they act.   In fact Ben told me that he talked to a different police chief who told him ...   The young people who are coming into the academy the past few years have never been in a physical fight.   Which is a problem because when they get into a fight their heart starts to race and their muscles tense up and they do not really know what to do.   So they freak out and they are way more likely to draw a weapon and use the weapon to -- you know to end the confrontation.   So how do you deal -- you cannot ask how many times have you beat somebody up or been beaten up on your resume?   No no. So Ben says that that is why the police chief told him he looks to hire bouncers.   I see. Bouncers.   Or for Chitwood he said ...   From just my little myopic world that I live in we have an awful high number of men and women who served in the military. They are my best officers. They are level-headed they are well-trained they know how to follow the policy.   Basically they know how to not freak out during a confrontation. And last thing -- promise this is the last thing -- one of the most important things Chitwood says ...   Is you have to get into the community. And I am not talking about the good stuff. Oh we -- they bought Christmas gifts or they cooked Thanksgiving dinner I am talking day-to-day.   You have to get to know people.   Yeah let me -- come on.   All right. Sure.   And so to make this point Chitwood got up walked me down the hall to another office sat me down at a computer.   The sound comes on in about 20 seconds.   Okay.   They show me this video. So video starts in silence and it is a body cam video. It is a body cam on the cop who is driving a squad car.   He is got his body camera. It is mounted to his eye.   On his glasses.   So the cameras' going where his eyes go.   Next to him passenger side is his partner. Both cops are white. Also it is night.   So the call is for a guy who is running around with a knife trying to stab people. He was off his meds. I think he was on a crack cocaine binge if I remember correctly. They park.   It is a little neighborhood street and you can see down the street ...   Half a block away ...   ... this shirtless black guy.     That is the cop talking to him the cop wearing the body cam. And this Black man ...   He is got his arm raised.   Pretty big knife in his hand. And he is walking towards the cops.     The Black guy gets closer and closer and closer. And finally the cop wearing the body cam pulls out ...   A taser.   The other officer ...   ... who was out of the frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy ...     ... is approaching approaching approaching approaching.     And he gets within like 10 feet of the cops and then ...     The guy with the body cam fires the taser. The guy holding the knife he falls onto his back onto this like cement driveway. He is still got the knife in his hand.     And the cop who is got his gun out he hustles over kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabs him by the hand turns them over and then ...     ... cuffs him.   And then ...     The officer will say Why did not you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me? Why did you keep coming at me?                     He tells the officer goes I am Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know that police bullets cannot kill me.     So the two cops pick him up walk him over to the squad car put him in and the video ends.   Huh. So this is the thing that you guys would -- you use this video for what exactly?   This is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers on the correct way to do things you know? And that is the points we hit home are the officers use time and distance to their advantage. They did not pull right up and the guy leans in the car and tries to stab one of them and now you have to resort to deadly force right away. They use verbal commands first. Warn him let him know what is going on. Trigger control was another thing you know? What that Taser Taser Taser.     And this is important because the guy's partner was holding a gun and had he heard this ...     ... pop he might have just instinctively reacted thinking that was a gunshot and fired his gun.   So you know he is deploying the taser. And communication is key. Communication with the person you are trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers. Those are the things that we drive home. And again there was no doubt in my mind that the one officer in particular knew that individual from prior contact.   Right. I mean it is interesting to hear him say the name Derek.   Right.   It is like Derek is Derek and Derek is not just a Black man shirtless with a knife in his hand.   When there is no connection there it is a lot easier to see somebody as nameless and faceless and I got scared and I shot him. But because of that knowing that officer because of that it established some kind of a rapport that made the officer think of how he is going to deal with this thing.   And actually after we finished watching the video and I was packing up Chitwood told me that just a couple months after that incident ...   I am biking through the neighborhood and my man sitting on the front step waves at me. Hey Chitwood. How you doing man?   Derek does?   Yeah. You stupid son of a bitch. You do not know how close you came to being dead. But he is back on his medication was not doing drugs and he was as completely as normal as me and you are right now.   Now again almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left ...     Mike Chitwood was elected the sheriff of Volusia County.     Which is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to.   Huh.   And the other thing to mention is that Chitwood belongs to this organization called PERF which is the Police Executive Research Forum. It is this big coalition of police chiefs and in 2016 PERF put out what they call their 30 Guiding Principles For the Use of Force. And the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life.   Hmm.   Now just a month after PERF put out those principles two of the biggest policing organizations in the world the IACP the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the Fraternal Order of Police the big policing union both came out against these guiding principles. Basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous. And then just like eight months later or so the IACP and the Fraternal Order of Police started to adopt some of these principles publicly. Despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations. But according to Ben ...   For the very first time I think you are seeing these massive conversations. You know police were not talking about this two or three years ago.   Huh. I do not know man. Just thinking about this like you have got these women who have become kind of a political force. You have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly.   Right.   But cumulatively it does -- I hesitate to use this word but it does make -- it does feel like reason for hope.   Right. And I sort of felt the same way too. But there was this experience that I had where I just realized how far hope has to go.   We are here to see Natasha Clemens?   Natasha Clemens the mother of Rodney Mitchell.   So Natasha's the woman who you heard earlier back at the community center.   I have met 400 other mothers who is lost their children.   That is actually when I first met her. Ben had been reporting on Natasha for like a couple of years by this point and we were there because Ben was gonna hand a ton of documents over to Natasha on her son Rodney's case because she did not have any. And I was there because we would set up a short interview with Natasha. But when we got to her door she just started sobbing.   What is going on?      And Ben and I just had no idea what had happened.      Eventually I just turned the tape recorder off.   Huh. So what was -- what was happening in that moment?   Well okay. So to back up so meeting somebody like a Chitwood you know like there is a sort of hope in that I believe. But the thing about a Chitwood a sheriff a police chief is that they only have the power to fire a police officer and that is really about it. After that it goes into the court system. And so for Natasha her son Rodney 23 years old unarmed was shot and killed by two police officers during a traffic stop. After the shooting a judge ruled that the two officers had done nothing wrong. They had acted in accordance with the law. And it just so happened that 45 minutes before Ben and I showed up at her door she would just gotten an email from her lawyer saying that the appeal that she had filed against that decision had just been rejected. And so we sat there in Natasha's apartment for a while. We actually even left for like an hour. Eventually came back. Kind of just hit reset on the whole thing. Eventually Natasha showed me some pictures of Rodney.   Long dreads. He is got a big big smile.   Big smile bright white smile.   And then we sat down in her kitchen table.   Okay so if you can walk me back to the night that kind of everything -- everything happened.   June 11 2012.   Natasha was at home.   30 at night.   Rodney who was 23 years old was back from college and out driving Natasha's car.   And that is when all the phone calls started happening.   People calling and saying ...   Something's going on with your car. I knew something was wrong. So I immediately started screaming outside to see if I can get somebody to you know respond to help me so I can get a ride. Nobody came out so I started running down the interstate.   Barefoot.   I just left. I do not even recall locking the door or anything like that.   Eventually a family member actually picks her up. They drive to the scene. She gets there.   It looks like just people everywhere. Police cars. And I was like Where is Rodney? I was looking for my vehicle and my one cousin says Tasha he is over there.   She pointed about 20 feet over to where the car had come to a stop. It had collided with a gas station.   But they she had the back of my -- loop of my pants. So that I could not run over there.   The whole place was surrounded by police tape. And eventually Natasha says it took a couple hours but a cop pulled her off to the side and told her that her son had been shot and killed by police.   I just got on my knees hands and knees and started praying. Do not let this be true please Lord. I was basically begging and pleading. That is the only thing I could do. What -- what else do you do? Just cry scream pray cry scream pray cry scream pray. The next thing you know I woke up. I was at the hospital.   Natasha says that she apparently was so frenzied that an EMT on the scene stuck her with something.   To calm me down. So when I woke up I see my family standing over me in the hospital.   Now as to what happened to Rodney that night Ben has looked at testimony from the cops involved from eyewitnesses different court records to piece together the events.   You know Rodney ...   According to all these documents that night Rodney and his 16-year-old cousin were in Natasha's car. They had stopped at a gas station. They left the gas station and were driving down this highway when ...   He and his little cousin get pulled over by two white officers. The officer said he saw him without a seatbelt. Turns out Rodney was wearing a seat belt. And these two officers approach his vehicle. One is kind of standing in front of the car.   About several feet away towards like the driver side.   And the officer approaches his window.   According to Rodney's cousin ...   He says Boy why did not you pull over sooner? And -- and then orders Rodney to put the car in park. And Ronnie's got both hands at this point on the steering wheel and he reaches down to put the car in park ...   And this is where things in the story sort of diverge because the cops say that Rodney put the car in park but then quickly put it back into drive accelerated at the officer in front of the car. Ronnie's cousin gives two conflicting accounts as to what happened. There was apparently an eyewitness across the street who said the car had yet to move. But what is clear is what happened next which is ...   The deputy in front ...   ... pulls out his gun fires two shots into the windshield. The deputy right by the door ...   ... hears the fire. He pulls a gun and fires twice.   One bullet went through Rodney's left hand which he would put up in self-defense. Another bullet entered through his left temple.   And the car lurches forward and careens across the street ...   ... for about 300 yards until it collides with this gas station. Rodney's cousin at this point gets out of the car flees from the scene unharmed. Eventually paramedics arrived and pronounce Rodney dead at the scene.   My mind is always on Rodney.   Natasha says when she does think about that night she always comes back to this one question.   Why were their guns pulled? Why? Why? What -- why was the -- what was that all about?   What do you think the answer is?   He is Black. And that is just it.   Is there ever a moment where you try and put yourself in the mind of those two officers?   Absolutely not because I would never do somebody's kid like that. That never crossed -- no I would never do that.   Do you feel like it is like -- do you feel like the cop in that moment it is Rodney's Black is what frightens the cop and that is why he pulls his gun out?   No. He is a bully. Hell if somebody gets hurt or somebody gets injured or killed he is gonna get off. He is behind that blue badge. He is a bully.   And is that what you think of cops like writ large?   Absolutely. That is how it is. That is exactly how it is. No ifs ands and buts about it.   Because it is hard for me because I think like -- like it is clear that there is discrimination with -- that exists within the police force in the people who they are sworn to protect and serve. But like at the end of the day there is probably a hand -- like well I do not know. I could not give you a percentage but a number of officers in which like yes they are probably violent individuals who do not belong in a police force but I would assume that like a majority of the cops mean well have probably -- probably have some sort of bias where they do not think I see a Black person and I am gonna like -- I am going to get that boy but that there is like a -- like there is some sort of triggered response. And -- and that the police are constantly being put into different situations where they feel under threat and concerned. And that like there is like a whole host of factors leading to these moments where somebody is shot and killed. It is not just that they are out here bullying people.   You say that because you are -- you are white. That is why you say that. I will tell you what. I will tell you what we can try this. Go to my sister we will make sure we get you a wig. Go to the tanning salon get yourself sprayed black. And I guarantee you you will get a different response. I dare you to try. I bet you we can make you look like a Black boy. I am telling you you will see a huge difference. And that is just it.   Like sitting -- like sitting there in that moment I -- I felt -- I felt the gulf. And I just kept wondering like how long does it take to fill that gulf? Like how many Chitwoods does it take? How many conversations need to happen? In any case ...   Do you want us to ...   Ben still had to give Natasha those files on Rodney.   ... to get those documents for you?   I would appreciate it.   Sure okay.   So Ben grabbed this huge folder of paper out of the trunk of our car walked back inside.   So this is not everything.   Ben put the stack of Rodney's files on this glass kitchen table.   I took out of this stack like 10 crime scene photos because I do not want to be the person to give you those. Unless you want me to go get them right now. But they are ...   Mm-hmm.   I do not want -- I do not want to have to -- I do not want to re-traumatize you and they are graphic. Just frankly they are graphic. You know so I will leave it up to you. And you do not have to tell me right now.   Yeah when I am ready I will -- I will get them. That is something I am gonna have to eventually see.   Three days later Natasha contacted Ben and said that she was ready to see those photos.   Huge thanks to Ben Montgomery at the Tampa Bay Times and to the staff of the paper that did all the hard work of gathering statistics and material.   In the near near future they are gonna be putting out Ben's story a whole series of videos and interactive graphic with all their final numbers. It should be amazing. Definitely check it out. We will make sure that we link to it when it is live from our website Radiolab.dot.org.   And then of course to our own Matt Kielty who reported and produced this piece.   Next week we will bring you part two of Matt Kielty and Ben Montgomery's reporting. It is a very different kind of story. Check-in for that.   Okay.   I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.
