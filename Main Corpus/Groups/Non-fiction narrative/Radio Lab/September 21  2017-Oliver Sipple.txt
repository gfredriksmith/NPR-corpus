 This story contains a couple moments of profanity cursingjust a few. Know that before you go in.   This is Radiolab Im Jad Abumrad. So today I want to play for you really one of my favorite stories we have ever done on Radiolab. It is one of those like perfect stories where all the different things you want in a story come together all at once. Like you have got this single human being going through something truly unique and difficult. But inside that single human being story isin that kind of universe in a blade of grass sort of wayis everything. You know it is that kind of story. Comes from Latif. This is back in the days when Latif was a producer and this is before he was hosting the show with Lulu Miller and I. Its back in the time when I was hosting the show with Robert Krulwich so I do not know let us just let it roll.  Hey Im Jad Abumrad.  I am Robert Krulwich.  This is Radiolab.  And today we are going to start.  Okay so let us start...  With our producer Latif Nasser.  Yeah...  Well let us just let us just go back to San Francisco on a particular day at a particular time...  Well and a particular woman.  Hello.  Hi. Is this Sarah Jane?  Yes it is.  A woman named...  Sarah Jane Moore.  Sarah Jane.  Okay.  So this is San Francisco. The particular date was September 22. The particular time...  1975  It is a Monday morning. Was it a nice day?  Oh yeah. I do not remember anything different so I assume it was a nice day.  Okay all right sure sure.  I was kind of you know in my own head. I remember...  So Sarah Jane on this Monday morning she wakes up early drops her nine year old off at school runs a few errands. Then she drives downtown to thisthis big fancy hotel.  What was the name of the hotel?  Uh I think it is the St. Francis is not it? I am 87 years old do not expect me to remember all the details like that.  Ok alright fair enough.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh-huh but at any rate you know I parked in the parking garage acrossright across from the hotel theres a park but theres a parking garage underneath. Walked over and walked across the street. There werethere were sidewalks on both sides of the street. There were people on both sidewalks.  She joins the crowd across the street from the hotel.  It was very crowded.  A couple thousand people. Its like aits like a big scene.  And there was a barriera rope barrierrightkeeping us back on the sidewalk. And my plan had always been to be back in the crowduh you know and I was dressed like every other middle aged woman that was there. So I  What were youdo you remember what you were wearing? I mean Im sure theres uh  Oh there are pictures of it yes. I was wearingI was wearing slacks. That wasthat was at the beginning of when it was natural for women to wear slacks. I had a coat on. And I was carrying a purse. And I went back into the middle of the crowd as I had planned to do. Anyway I felt a man come up against me and socialized as I was in that day and time I spun around to slap his face.  She sees this guy there big strong guy blonde hair  Looked at him and realized that it was crowd pressure that he had not done anything out ofout of ordinary that  Mhmm.  So I turned back around and uh went on about my business. Uh I was then pushed up the crowd pressure was suchI tried to stay back in the crowdbut I got pushed up almost onto the ropes in the front. Right up on the curb of the sidewalk. Its where I had not planned to be. Uh andand he apparently was still right behind me so maybe he was pushed up by the crowd also.  And so Sara Jane is just crammed into this crowd and shes just standing there.  Yes.  And were youwere you nervous?  Oh nuh-uh. You set out to do something and I was just going about doing what I had set out to do.  So she waits and she waits and an hour goes by and two and three and then finally   Out of the hotel comes none other than the president of the United States Gerald Ford. And he has police and Secret Service and they are all coming they are walking out of the hotel.  To get in his car which was parked there on the street.  But he sees the crowd Sara Jane actually says he looks directly at her and he waves. He waves to the crowd and everyone starts applauding and cheeringnow right at that momentSara Jane reaches her right hand into her purse  And pulled the gun out of my purse.  A 38 caliber revolver. She cocks it and then she takes aim right at Gerald Ford's head. And then  Oh my God theres been a shottheres been a shot  ButMr. Ford did not fall.   The bullet flies a few feet to the right of Ford chips the wall behind him. Ford freezes in place. Sara Jane  Never planned to take a second shot.  Now shes just still standing there.  With my hand still in the air holding the gun.  Looking over the smoking barrel of the gun. And shes got enough time if she wants it but before she can take that second shot the blonde man behind her lunges at her grabs her gun arm pulls it down and deflects it for just that crucial second that these police officers nearby need to get to her. They tackle her they take her gun and they pin her to the ground.  So I could not move.  And by that point the Secret Service has whisked off the president into the limousine  And I was immediately picked up and carried across the street  Into the hotel  Arrested  And eventuallyuh she went to prison. And she served 32 years in prison.  Huh.  Uh and thenand then after that was released on parole. And then we talked to her.  Woah  Theres a...  I was not prepared to be told thea first person narrative from the perspective of someone who was about to assassinate the president. That was not what I was expecting.  I was hoping that um...  Wait can you explain though why it is she decided to shoot the guy?  Yeah whywhy did she shoot?  Yeah...  Well Sara Jane's never fully explained that uh and in fact whenwhen I asked her  Well this is not  She was like I am not going there.  This is not an interview about what was driving me or about what I did or why I did it. This is an interview about Mr. Sipple.  Sipple?  Yeah. Oliver Sipple.  Huh  Hes the random blonde guy who just happened to be standing next to Sara Jane Moore that day. The guy who grabbed her arm and saved the president's life.  And he paid dearly for that.  I actually called up Sara Jane and had her tell that whole story because I was actually interested in what happened to Oliver Sipple after that.  Because had he not reached out and put his hand on my arm...   None of this would have happened to him.  Wait what happened to him?  So Oliver Sipple actually died in 1989 but um before we get to the story I just want to give you a picture of the guy. So uh just google search Oliver Sipple Ford...  Okay...  Or something  Wait okay waitI see the picture. Oh I see look at that.  Hes a muscular guy kind of blonde hair. Hes ahes ahe is a umhes a handsome guy.  He is a little bit James Dean and Marlo Brando had a baby kinda?  He feels like an all Americanhe feels all American. There is something all American about him.  Thank you.  Yeahyeah we are bringing in another all American for this story. Uh Daniel Luzer.  An editor at Oxford University Press. Um and a few years agothis was probably more than five years agoI wrote an article about Oliver Sipple. But anyway  To get back on track.  September 22nd 1975   Sara Jane Moore fires that shot. Oliver Sipple grabs her armthe police  Wrestle Moore to the ground  And then the police actually grab Oliver too pull him inside the hotel to question him.  Because there is initially some confusion about what he was doing there and some thought thatyou knowhe might have been a suspect.  And so hes in this hotel trying to light a cigarette but he just could not do it because he was shaking so hard.  Hm.  Turns out Oliver had served two very rough tours in Vietnam.  Loud noises would make him very unhappy. I think this is the sort of thing we might call post traumatic stress disorder now.  But when eventually Oliver started to calm down the Secret Service were likewhat are you even doing here?  It was kind of hard for him to answer because it is like he did not even really know. It was just likeI do not know I was taking a walk.  And I just bumped into this huge crowd of people asked what was going on.  People were like oh like Gerald Ford is going to be here you know the president is going to be here.  So he said he thought I might as well see him. And then he was standing there for a couple of hours until  He saw a flash of metal  Realized it was a gun.  Reacted quickly.  Instinctively.  And then  You guys all pulled me in here.  That is how I came to be here.  So he is questioned for three hours. He goes homehome to his fourth floor walk upand there is a reporter there waiting for him. But hehe just wants to sort of be left alone and he told this reporter um quoteI am a coward. I do not know why I did it. It was the thing to do at the time. And then even after that he just kept getting phone calls from reporters. Andand some of them learned that he was a Marine and so they would ask him questions like oh was it youryou knowwas it your training? Is that why you did this heroic thing?  But he said oh you know listen do not mention any of that stuff about the Marines. Lets keep that under wraps.  QuoteIm no hero or nothing.But...the next day   Oliver's story...shot across the country.   His name's on television   On the front page of newspapers where there is headlines like ex-Marine deflects weapon as woman shoots. That is the LA Times. Chicago Tribunehero tells how he deflected woman's arm. And so despite his best efforts Oliver becomes a national hero for a day.  And it appears that he sort of thought that would be it.  Maybe his friends would give him a pat on the back buy him a couple rounds.  And thenyou know over the next couple of days it all sort of like rippled out of control.  Because that very same day that Oliver was being painted as a hero this guy named Herb Caen  The longtime San Francisco columnist.  Walked into his office and on his answering machine were two messages sayinghey that guy Oliver Sipple the hero?  Who has saved the president's life? Is gay.  Huh Was hewas he out?  Well he was sort of outand sort of not.  What does that mean?  Well to explain you have got to understand this particular time and place. So lets justyou knowtake a magic carpet ride. Close your eyes and let the sound take you away.    So San Francisco     Was one of the first cities in America to have a gay pride parade. And in the 70s    For gay people San Francisco was like this shelter from the storm.  Many of us were immigrants from somewhere.  This is Ken Maley.  Longtime San Francisco resident  And gay activist who at the age of 19 uh came to San Francisco from Kansas  I escaped from Kansas because what the west offered was the ethereal promiseif you willof reinvention. You could cross a line in which your past stayed behind you.  It was a place where you could be out but to the people you left behind you could still be in.  So uh so...  And so for Oliveryou knowhe came from Michigan  From a working class family. Uh he had a lot of brothers and sisters. I think he was one of eight children.  And so after the war when he got to San Francisco he actually started going by the name Billy.  Billy. Uh Billy Sipple. And he was perfectly open about his sexual orientation and would tell anybody who asked that he was a gay man. But you know he never told his family.  And so Oliver lived like a lot of gay people at the time this double life.  Yeah yeah.  And do we know that this is the reason why Sipple came to San Francisco or was there a different reason  It may have just been because Harvey Milk was there.  The Harvey Milkyou knowfamous gay activist San Francisco politician.  He was friends with Harvey Milk.  The New Yorker. An immigrant from New York.  Turns out Oliver had actually met Harvey a decade earlier in New York and II just want to mention this because I think it is so cool at different points in time they actually dated the same guy  Who was the inspiration for Sugar Plum Fairy.   In Lou Reed's Walk On The Wild Side. Just a fun factjust a fun fact thats it.  But um Oliver and Harvey they were pretty good friends. They corresponded stayed in touch when they lived in different places in the country. Actually Harvey even loaned Oliver money sometimes because Oliver didnt have a job. He you know collected disability from his time in the Marines. But anyway  By the beginning of the '70s  When Oliver got to San Francisco reconnected with his old friend  Harvey wasuh shall we say evolving into  A huge figure there.  A gay public figure.  Ken was actually friends with Harvey worked on one of his campaigns.  Andand.  But this Im sorry.  No no no and and I am just thinking like one of the things we were talking about on the phone was about sort of thethe kind of two different schools or two different  I was just about to segway to that.  Oh perfect. Okay goyeah yeah go for it.  So this older otherI would say older but other generation of gay mostly men was thatthey were content to go to tea with the mayor or public official of some kind.   They would show up to like a rally  Wearing jackets and ties.  And like ask for their rights politely.  They really were not shall we say activists.   Because according to Ken the activism came   When in the late '60s early '70s you had young gay men and women   Who came out of the Vietnam war protests into the world  Took a look around   The police are still raiding bars   People are still getting beaten   Both violently and nonviolently.   And...after a while a body of people get to a point where they just will not take oppression anymore.  So...   In came the activists like Harvey.  Pony tail mustache he was a banker turned hippie.   He was very outspoken   Very militant   And to Harvey   Gay people were living in a half life opportunity.   Not being able to be who they were.    And so...cut back to  September 22nd 1975.  In the blink of an eye Oliver Sipple becomes this hero. And that same night Olivers friend Harvey hears about all this news and kind of senses wait maybe theres an opportunity here. So he picks up the phone and he calls the columnist Herb Caen a very very well known well loved gossip columnist. And Caen isnt there so Milk leaves a message on his answering machine. And he basically says look Im a friend of Oliver Sipples. Ive known him for years. Uh Oliver Sipple worked on my campaign for supervisor. So basically withwithout Sipples consent  Harvey outed him.  Milk outed him.  What was Harvey Milk thinking that he would do this?  Well for Harvey...   Of gay people as limp-wristed and drag queens and stuff   Well here's a true gay hero.  A square jawed heroic Marine  Who seemed to be a sort of like regular like red blooded American.  And so Harvey said and this was written down by his biographer who I am quoting It is too good an opportunity. For once we can show that gays do heroic things not just all that caca about molesting children and hanging out in bathrooms.  Was not there someone who said no no no you gotta ask the guy you cannot just do that?  Harvey just did it.  Really?  Yeah he just did it.  So Caenthe next morningCaen arrives at his office he listens to the message and Caen tries to call Sipple but he cant reach him. But there was another guy who was a gay activist. His name was the Reverend Ray Broshears. He was the head of what is calledwhat was called the Lavender Panthers. And he also independently called Herb Caen to say oh that guy Oliver Sipple everyone's talking about on the news? Gay. So he got two independent sources both of people who said that they were friends with Sipple and that he was gay. And for Caen I think this was juicy. This was a juicy thing.  Um and he uh. Let us see. What is this? Let me like just go back and get this.  So two days after the assassination attempt Caens column comes out.  And the way that he wrote it up this is the precise paragraph one of the heroes of the day Oliver Billy Sipple the ex-Marine who grabbed Sara Jane Moore's arm just as her gun was fired and thereby may have saved the president's life was the center of midnight attention at the Red Lantern a Golden Gate Avenue bar he favors. Reverend Ray Broshears head of Helping Hands Center and gay politico Harvey Milk who claim to be among Sipple's close friends describe themselves as proud maybe this will help break the stereotype.  And then that day this guy named Daryl Lembke  Lembke. L-E-M-B-K-E.  Picks up his issue of The Chronicle sees Herb Caen's column.  I read and I reported to the office.  The office of the Los Angeles Times.  I was a reporter for the LA Times in San Francisco and so my office told me get an interview with Oliver Sipple.  But really quickly before we get there we actually managed to get a recording of this very specific interview in the LA Times collection at the Huntington Library in Los Angeles. And I think the reason they hung onto it was cause it was kind of controversial.  So the night that Caen's article comes out Daryl goes to Oliver's house Oliver's there.  Two reporters from the Sentinel were there also.   That right there is Daryl.      So they are all sitting in Oliver's living room and what the reporters are all wondering ishave you heard from the president?  The president had not bothered to thank him at that point.      And that voice right there? Thats Oliver.          Something Oliver should know because this is again this is at a time when the assumption was that all gay men were just...pedophiles. Perverts.    Daryl actually asks if he can call somebody and ask about it.        Daryl calls local authorities but he cant get ahold of anyone.        And then the tape recorder goes off. Comes back on.   And now Oliver's on the phone with the police department.    Now the reason this tape is so controversial is because according to Oliver before the interview began before the you know recorder started rolling he had said to the reporters from the Sentinel um okay I am going to talk to you guys about my sexuality but then he had said to Daryl I do not want you to write anything about that. I do not I dont want that in a national paper. Daryl says he does not remember that. But then right here in this interview this thing happens where Daryl says   I will make one more try on the gay thing.   You do not want to change your mind on that?       And eventually    Interview ends. And Daryl says that when he left that interview he felt like when it came to Olivers sexuality....  He didnt want to be quoted.  That was it like just dont quote me on it. But still  I was trying to report from all sides about it. The big side for me was that he was a hero and the president of the United States was very slow on the take in thanking him for saving his life.  And Daryl thought that Oliver's sexuality the fact that he was gay might have something to do with that. Because just seven months earlier   This Air Force sergeant named Leonard Matlovich who uh had the purple heart had the bronze star he comes out that hes gay and hes kicked out of the Air Force.   And now you have got this former Marine saved the president's life and its two days later he still hasnt heard from the president.  So thats when I knew...  So for Daryl even though Oliver had said dont make this about my sexuality  I still thought it was a national story and it was pretty hard to ignore it after Herb Caen had started the ball rolling.  So that night after the interview Daryl calls in his story to the LA Times office and he uses this phrase. He says that Oliver is a former Marine who was quote a prominent figure in the gay community.  Put it downaways in the story but the rewrite guy put it in the lede  Really...  And it made it the big thing.  And so three days after the assassination attempt the LA Times runs a story with the headline no call from president hero in Ford shooting active among SF gays.  And uh the LA Times did a news service  And so Daryl's story it goes I mean it goes everywhere.   Headlines are like gay vet or homosexual hero...   And so it was not just running in Los Angeles. Its also running in Chicago its running in Dallas its running in Indianapolis and its running you know off all places in Oliver Sipples hometown. In Detroit.  I guess what I am wondering is if you have a guy who says... please do not talk about this. This has nothing to do with what I did yesterday. Should not that play some role in what you decide to write or not to write?  Well you know news sources are always reluctant to talk and so I guess I took it as my duty to take up that angle especially since it involved the president of the United States.  Right.  But uh.  If you were to do it all over again would you do anything differently?   UhI do not know. UhIhad nottaken into account maybe uhthe potential harm of saying it. I do not know if I would do it over again or not. But I am not able to turn back the clock for something like that.   The clock marches forward after the break.   This is Radiolab. We are back with the story of Oliver Sipple from reporterproducer Latif Nasser.  So the assassination attempt was on Monday and on Thursday...Sipple and his lawyer call a press conference.             He basically says like stop stop. It is kind of as simple as that.  Yeah.  But there is something else that happens in the press conference that ismakes the whole thing I mean so much morepersonal.   And it actually was the very reason that Oliver called the press conference in the first place.     Oliver would later say that uh when he was talking on the phone with his mother she said to him I dont want to speak to you ever again.    Did you call him UncleUncle Oliver or GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Yes I called him Uncle Oliver yeah.  This is George Sipple Jr. Oliver's nephews. He told me that most of Olivers family stayed in Detroit. Olivers two brothers and his dad worked together at an auto plant there. GEORGE SIPPLE JR. They all worked for General Motors. And the story that I have heard is that  The day after Oliver saved the life of President Ford GEORGE SIPPLE JR. They walked in and everyone wanted to like buy them a beer. You know everybody on the factory floor um was congratulating them patting them on the back you know your brother's a hero your son's a hero. You know when they would take their shift break and this was the old days right they would take a shift break and they would go to the bar and everybody wanted to like buy them a round of drinks. So then the news comes out whatevera daya couple of days later that he is this gay Marine and there is teasing on the factory floor.  Teasing mean teasing or teasing... GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Yeah. Yeah. Mm hm. Yeah.  And George says what happened is reporters back in Detroit just sort of descended on Olivers parents GEORGE SIPPLE JR. To get more of the story. And so they kept knocking on my grandmother's door and she I guess apparently told them to go away I guess neighbors were harassing her. She thought the media was harassing her. My grandmother just said I do not want to deal with it. And so do not come knock on the door leave us alone. They just wanted it to go away and go back to their you know private lives.  Now one of the things that I found actually after talking to George were these interviews done with Oliver's family after the news broke that Oliver was gay. And theres justI just want to read you this one particular passage. Here. Have you talked to any other membersthis is from George F. Sipple who is Oliver Sipple's brother. Have you talked to any other members of your family since September 1975 about Oliver? Um I mentioned it once to my father. QuestionAnd what was his response what did he say? And if you can remember. I was on afternoons then and I had seen him because I had come in early. And he mentioned the fact that the next person that even said he had a son named Oliver he was going to literally break their damn neck.  Whoa. So his dad was likethis is his brother talking about his dad's reaction?  Brother talking to the dad yeah. And then so then the brother says and he told me quite clearly in two letter words just forget you got a brother. And I let him alone.  Wow.       Can you tell us the story of the letter? GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Uh I wish I would have brought it. I I do have it but I did not bring it today.  The same day as that press conference which was three days after the assassination attempt Gerald Ford actually did write a letter to Oliver Sipple which was then released publicly. GEORGE SIPPLE JR. It is a nice letter. It is White House stationary White House envelope. It is basically Ford telling my uncle that you know he is thankful to him for this heroic deed and he signed it Gerry Ford which I have been told that Gerald Ford signed different ways. So if he signed Gerry Ford it meant something it was like a personal touch.  Well there is this other chapter where your uncle says says to the president I guess writes the president  Well so yeah we foundwe found a letter in the Gerald Ford library it is from your uncle to the president GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Wow.  That yeah GEORGE SIPPLE JR. I did not I did not know about that letter.  Really? I have the letter right now so it isso the date on it is September 30th 1975. So here's what it says. Uh dear Mr. President GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Wait wait wait wait. You said it was what? It was when?  September 30th 1975. So that would be a couple days after he got the letter from Ford. GEORGE SIPPLE JR. This wasso obviously obviouslyhe gotmy grandmother must have hung up on him...  Right. GEORGE SIPPLE JR. And then he wrote the letter.  Yeah yeah it sounds like... GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Cause cause he could not  Yeah yeah GEORGE SIPPLE JR. That is really interesting. Whats the letter say?  Yeah and stop me any time if you have thoughts or reactions. Dear Mr. President thank you for taking the time to write to me. In view of some of the events since the unfortunate attempt on your life on Monday September 22nd I really appreciate your publicly thanking me. As you probably know there have been a number of stories concerning my personal sexual orientation in the news media. These stories have caused great anguish to my parents and to the rest of my family I am sure. My mother hung up on me when I first called her after these stories began to be published. I know you are concerned with very many matters which are too important and pressing for you to be concerned with the details of my private life. However the unexpected and glaring publicity which has been given to my private life has very seriously disrupted my family relationships. Mr. President it is a very hard thing to have your mother and family not want to have any contact with you. I know that your schedule is heavily occupied but I respectfully request that you take the time to see my family or at least call my family. The telephone number is...I love my family and I do not want to be separated from their love and companionship. Your help will be gratefully appreciated. Respectfully Oliver W. Sipple. GEORGE SIPPLE JR. Wow...That is sad...Sadder to think that nothing came of it...You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.   We tried really hard to find out if Ford ever made that call. The archivists at the Ford Library they went through his call logs and there was no evidence that he ever made that call. And then we talked to George Jr. and he talked to everybody in his family and they do not remember it either. Anyway you cannot say for sure but as far as we can tell that call never happened. But we did find out that the same day that Oliver sent that letter back to Ford he and his lawyer filed a 15 million lawsuit against the press.  Really? Saying what?  That the newspapers when they publicized that he was gay without his consent they violated his privacy.  Okay walking out of Civic Center BART onto Civic Center in San Francisco.  It is just its one of these cases where it pulls your head in one direction and it pulls your heart in the exact opposite direction and so we wanted to get into the legal case files and could not find them. We looked and looked and looked and then we found them.  You found them?  We found them.  Where did you find them?  Uh so the clerk's office is I guess not surprisingly right off City Hall.  They were at this court in San Francisco and so we recruited this guy this researcher a historian of the you know gay movement in San Francisco uh great name Joey Plaster and he Clerk Okay so I am going to need your ID  Okay.  Um went and got these files for us. And then when we found them it turned out there were like thousands and thousands upon thousands of pages.  And is that everything? Clerk This is everything.  That is everything okay.  So the issue you know its a very fundamental issue for those of us in journalism  And to help us make sense of the arguments lurking in those pages  What is privacy and what is invasion of privacy?  We talked to Dan Morain.  Editorial page editor of the Sacramento Bee.  He actually first heard about this case in journalism school and also wrote about Oliver Sipple way back in the 1980s. So anyway.  Okay so heres the first page of the file.  The lawsuit was against the Chronicle.  The case is Oliver W. Sipple Plaintiff v. Chronicle Publishing Company.  It was against the LA Times.  The Des Moines Register the Chicago Sun Times the Denver Post the Indianapolis Star and the San Antonio Express.  Wow.  Okay lets see so this is the deposition of Oliver W. Sipple. Let us see  So one of the arguments that the lawyers for the newspapers were making is that Olivers sexuality was not actually private.  Lawyer Were there any people that you knew in San Francisco in say September 1975 who knew that you were homosexual? Sipple Yes. Lawyer Approximately how many people? Sipple I have no idea. Lawyer More than 10? Sipple Yes. Lawyer More than 50? Sipple Yes. Lawyer More than 100? Sipple Yes.  There were people in New York who knew he was gay there were people in Dallas who knew he was gay and it kind of-they settle in the like in the hundreds.  Lawyer Did you tell anybody before September of 1975 that you were a homosexual? Sipple If I were asked. Lawyer I am asking you. Sipple I do not know what you are asking.  And they make the argument the newspapers' lawyers that hey this was already somewhat public a fact.  But his personal business was his personal business.  I have never attempted to obtain publicity for the fact that I am gay or predominantly homosexual in my sexual orientation.  He was a private citizen.  I have made my home approximately 1800 miles away from home of my parents and my family so that I could move somewhat freely in the gay community without the fact of my sexual orientation getting back to my parents or family. And it goes on.  But the newspapers made this other argument that was like okay whether or not youre living a double life whether or not you wanted to or whether or not you had to theres something here thats bigger than that thats bigger than you.  Which was he was a private citizen who thrust himself as anybody would hope they would do. He ranhe went toward danger and when he did he also thrust himself into the public eye.   And to journalists when you are in the public eye you become something else entirely. You become a public figure.   When that happened to Oliver  He lost his right to privacy.   And the newspapers argued when it came to Oliver's sexuality  It was news at the time.  It is was and at all pertinent times has been my judgment that Mr. Sipple's activities in the gay community are highly significant and newsworthy for two important reasons. First   So like we said when Daryl Lembke was writing that article about Oliver you had this big story about the US Air Force trying to kick this guy Leonard Matlovich out because he was gay.   And Oliver has heard nothing from the president. The president later said that that had nothing to do with Oliver being gay but to people at the time  The suggestion that the president's expression of gratitude to Sipple might have been affected by rumors of Sipple's activities in the gay  That was news.   Second   Sipple's public display of heroism in saving the life of the president of the United States...  ...presented an image  That gay people are like everybody else. That they are heroes.  An image certainly contrary to the stereotype of persons associated with the gay community as weak and unheroic figures.  Which is to say this is newsworthy this is worth knowing and it is something that the whole country wants to know. And the value of that is more than the value of this individual persons privacy.  Did they make that explicitly? I mean sort of putting it in terms of the public benefit outweighs the private privacy  Yeah.  Hm.  So Oliver's case it dragged on for nine years so from 1975 to 1984. Um but this is Im quoting the judgment The record shows that the publications were not motivated by morbid and sensational prying into appellant's private life but rather were prompted by legitimate political concerns i.e. to dispel the false public opinion that gays were timid weak and unheroic figures and to raise the equally important political question whether the president of the United States entertained a discriminatory attitude or bias against a minority group such as homosexuals. So...the court tossed Olivers case out. He lost. He didnt get a dime.  I mean if you think about it it is weird that a journalist can just take a person's most private details and then if it feels relevant...like if they can make that argument they can just put it out there.  It is the joblike if we were to go silent because somebody says dont say that about me then...and the government backs him up  But if it is meaningful then the person...out of which the meaning is being pulled painfully has nothing to say about it...that is just weird to me.  It is really hard  I mean I was thinking about this like even sort of on the train coming over here.  Again Daniel Luzer.  And it is like...the thing that like makes journalism law so complicated and the things that make an invasion of privacy discussion so difficult is that like...what makes something not an invasion of privacy is not that it is okay it is that it is politically you know relevant. So like the fact that the story the fact that the private details of his life are politically relevant means that it is not an invasion of privacy. You know it does not mean that it is not rude or that it does not hurt. It means that it is an appropriate story to you know to publish.  But I do think like why should the journalists be the only ones to decide what is newsworthy? Its not like why is it that then journalists...you just pick up a notepad and a pencil and all the sudden you have so much more power to say what is sayable than anybody else.  Well I mean we have the sort of long tradition of that in the United States. I mean like that is what the first amendment is. I mean I dont know I mean it is like yeah sure why do journalists get to decide that? Well like who would you rather have decide it? It is not a perfect system but it isyou knowit kind of works.  So is Oliver just like this This is producer Tracie Hunte who was in on the interview.  Somebody whose life is basically kind of sacrificed to the altar of the first amendment in like this sad way?  Yes. Yeah.  Yeah it feels like he was sacrificed from all sides actually.  Yeah. It feels like there is this one kind of man in the middle and then there are all these forces around him these like larger than life forces like the White House there is the gay movement there is the freedom of the press and all these people are sort of batting around all these all these enormous and important abstractions and then in the middle of it there is this guy that just is trampled by all of them.  And so what ends up happening to him in the end?  Well apparently some people in the gay communityduring and after the lawsuitfelt that he was trying to go back in the closet so they sort of turned their backs on him. He surprisingly he was friends with Harvey Milk tilltill the end. Like when Harvey Milk was assassinated Oliver Sipple went to his funeral. Um he did have one brother George Sr. who stuck by him throughout but his parents did not. And they never fully accepted the fact that he was gay. And when his mom died it was so bad that Oliver Sipple's father did not let him go to the funeral. And because he sort of he had so few people I guess at the end and because there were not a lot news articles about him and because a lot of people from the gay community from that time have died because of the AIDS crisis it was really hard to find out what happened to Oliver Sipple in those last five years of his life. And the only way we could was because when we were talking to Daniel Luzer he mentioned this interview that he did with this guy named Wayne Friday. He was friend of Oliver's...  Wayne Friday was sort of like a a pillar of the community in San Francisco like a pillar of the gay community and then also a sort of political figure and he was a cop and he was sort of fingers in every pie kind of thing.  Wayne died last year but Daniel still had the transcript of their conversation about Oliver Sipple's last days. And so  If you guys need time to absorb or just think about for a sec that is fine with me.  We found an actor the very gifted Gordon Pinsent and we had him read it for us.  Okay let me have a go.  Uh I forget. Was it 1975 the Sara Jane Moore...or...yeah then I met him around '73. He was a swamper at a gay bar called Cockpit. Swamper they used to clean the bars at night. They would set the bar up for the next bartender in the morning that is what he did. He...did it at two or three different bars. He was always at the bars. I would see him. We actually became friends because we discovered we were both from Michigan. Bill was a good guy he was just a fucking alcoholic. I mean he would get his disability check once a month and he would go down one of the bars in the Tenderloin where he used to hang out was called the Queen Mary's Pub. He would go in there the day he got his check. I swear to God he would spend his whole fucking check on everybody. And he would get broke the rest of the month. He just could not control himself. And he was a little bit of a blowhard you know. He would get drunk and loud. And he would get tossed out of bars. I used to drive him home. He had an apartment on Van Ness had a little studio. A one bedroom on the first floor at about Turk. He would be drunker than hell at the bar and I would drive him home so I always knew where he lived.    And after this thing with Ford it really fucked his mind up. Sipple was a broken guy after that. The whole thing worked him. The publicity of it all and the fact that everyone knew he was a faggot you know. He said to me a couple times I went to the Marine Corps and I got hurt. And now what I am known for? For being a faggot. And I would say no you are not. You are known for saving the president's life. You will not be known for what you did in bed for Christ's sake. But he would get drunk and he would start bemoaning that. I would sit there in the bar with him and I would talk to him about it. Hey man it is what it is. But he was justhe was justdown to nothing. This thing happened and it overcame him. It was too much for him to handle. And I think he got to feeling sorry for himself and his family. Just...many a night I would sit in the bar with Bill Sipple and he would cry on your shoulder and you would say ok Sipple it is time to go home. And then I would drive him home.    I remember it was raining. It was pouring fucking rain. Bruce called me at my office over at the DA's office and said Wayne will you do a well being check on Sipple for me? And I said why? And he said nobody's seen the dude. He has not been around for a while. So we go out there together and it was raining and I am ringing the bell ringing the bell ring...he does not answer. I notice on his door there were these little stick 'em things post-its. And he would befriended this little old lady who lived next door they kind of looked after each other. And she would left all these little notes. Bill call me. I cannot get ahold of you. So I rang the manager's bell and it was a little Filipino guy. I showed him my badge and I said you have got to let me in. And so he did. And the door opened...and I knew what was going on. It is the smell. It is the smell you never forget. It is a sickening sweet smell. Bill was sitting in the chair. He was bloated. He was bloated out real big. He had a bottle of Jack Daniels sitting there and the television was still on. The coroner told me he would been dead about ten days as near as they could figure. God I did not know he was only 47. I thought he was older than that. Anyway. I got the guy to open the door for me. And the minute he did I said close it. And then I had to stand there and wait for the coroner.    I remember it was over here at the Campbell Funeral Home on Market Street. And then we buried him out in Golden Gate National Cemetery in San Bruno. And I remember it was it was very small. The casket was not opened. The funeral was just I meanthere were more media there than anything else. I have seen him buy drinks for more people than were at that funeral. He could have been buried in Arlington if they would made an issue out of it. I mean shit there he was this national icon a gay whatever and...there were just a few people out there for the funeral.   This story was reported by Latif Nasser and Tracie Hunt.
