   Before we get started this episode has a lot of strong language including repetitive f-bombs strung together to a beat.     I am Molly Webster. This is Gonads episode 5. This week we are bringing you a pair of episodes. This is the second one in the pair. They grew out of our reporting on Xs and Ys and all the different biological realities that live inside of us. In this episode ...   There you go. They are calling him.   Dana Zzyym.   Hello!   Hello hello.   Hi I can hear you.   Hi this is Molly Webster. I can hear you.   I got one ear working the other one's pretty low. But ...   Do you want to just turn the headphones around? Or is that working for you?   Dana is doing something kind of historic I guess you could say.   It is a little soft.   And just to start us off Dana uses the pronoun 'they.' Not 'him' or 'her' but 'they.' And a few years ago ...   2015 or '14 I cannot remember which. I have memory issues.   It is around 2014 Dana is filling out a passport application. And there are two boxes to check male or female. And Dana's like Well I am not either one of those. And so they wrote in a third option intersex.   I basically applied for my passport got talked to by the manager of the office. He took me aside and said You know you cannot get this passport. And they turned me down. And I appealed and ...   You can appeal a passport application?   Yeah.   To who? Do you go back to the passport office?   Just to the passport office.   I appeal!   Yeah I took everything back to the passport office and you know and I appealed.   But the passport office rejected the appeal basically saying male or female that is all we got.   Yeah and from there I found legal counsel.   So Dana ends up suing the State Department for a third non female non-male option. So we brought Dana into the studio to talk about the State Department case. And while we were having our conversation what began to unfold like in their personal life story was this tale of words. How words have the power to shape the world.     I was an Air Force brat so we moved all over the place.   Dana was born in 1958 Michigan.   Who was in the military your dad or your mom?   My dad. He was a career air force pilot. So I was in Alabama for a while Texas for a while Montana for a while England for a while.   As a kid!   As a kid.   Grew up with a bunch of brothers.   Two older brothers and one younger.   Like a whole pack of boys.   Approximately 18 months apart.   But Dana never really felt like one of them.   Yeah. I got teased a lot. When I started showering with other boys in probably like the fifth grade started getting teased about my size and looking physically different down there because my testicles did not look like the other boys. What it looked like? A stuffed sausage. It was little. Did not look right.   And Dana said it never felt right either.   Well I was always having pain peeing.   Oof. From when you were little?   Yeah you know going to the bathroom and those kind of things. Everything hurt. Not only that but I was klutz.   Smaller.   You know I threw a ball like a girl and ...   The brothers tried to help.   Older brother was always trying to teach me how to do things better. He was my hero for trying to stick up for me. But to me the world was a scary place. My dad was always gone flying and he was kind of a scary figure. My mother she had a backhand that would not quit and she never played tennis.   And Dana says for some reason their parents always kept a close watch on them.   I remember once in childhood we were living in Arkansas. The girl next door had those cut-out Barbie doll clothes and you know where you had cardboard Barbies. She had those and we were playing with those she and I. And my dad caught us.   Hmm.   I got my butt spanked and boys do not play with dolls.   Hmm.   My brothers were able to do things similar to that but I was not allowed to.   Oh so you think like if your brother was playing the paper dolls with the neighbor it would have been a different response?   I do believe that.   Did you have any idea like why?   Nope. I knew something was different. I just had no words. My world was very small.   And I think you could say it was partially because of that smallness in an effort to make the world like a little bit bigger in 1978 at 20.   I joined the Navy.   You did!   Mm-hmm.   That is so interesting because I would think that you would run away from the military after your dad.   My dad was in the Air Force. One of the decisions was well I ...   Oh you went opposite!    Yeah! Went to ...     The Persian Gulf. And then ...     The Falkland Islands. And then I did three tours in Beirut.   How did it feel to be -- to be part of the military or at least away from home and away from your siblings and your parents?   It felt fairly good. I felt a little free. Free -- free of the confines. But a couple things happened when I was in the Navy. About five years in. First people started thinking I was gay. Not that I did anything to encourage that. I did not date anybody I did not do anything.   Or do you remember how that started or why?   Well because I was so small. I did not go out drinking and trying to pick up women with the guys. Yeah and there was somebody on board my first ship who I guess was putting books and magazines on my rack very gay content.   Gay porn or something.   Explicit gay porn and some books.   You could think that leaving gay porn on someone's bed or bookshelf is not that big of a deal or it is some sort of like initiation thing or something. But this was at a time ...   Before Do not Ask Do not Tell.   Where if you were gay you were kicked out.   And so I got caught up in witch hunts. You know at one point the NIS which is a precursor to the NCIS ...   The National Institute of Security?   Navy Intelligence Service.   Oh okay. Close. Give me another acronym I will nail it.    Anyway so they interrogated me about you know who I was dating who I had sex with.   Really?   Yeah. You know those kind of things.   And then while all that was happening ...   When I was in Beirut on my second tour late fall 1982.   Dana was working below deck doing some paperwork in a noisy fan room. And an announcement went out on the ship that said that they are gonna do a test launch of one of the gigantic missiles on board. But Dana did not hear the announcement because they were in this super loud room.   And I get done my paperwork. I open the hatch to go back into the ship. I step out the gun goes off.   Firing a 70-pound projectile.   Maybe 20-30 feet away from my head.   Holy crap!   Yeah and the corpsman basically wiped blood out of my ears gave me some aspirin and he said Well you will get your balance back and go back to work. Basically back in those days they did not know about or they were not too concerned about brain injuries or anything like that. They just say Hey you just go back to work. You are fine. You know they did not really realize how much screwed up you can be from them.   Dana says that ever since that time ...   Yeah. I cannot -- I have a hard time looking backwards and telling time.   Needless to say after the witch hunts and the brain injury ...   They asked me to re-up and I am like No. You know when I got out you know four years after I got out I think it was or a little bit longer I started going to Colorado State University. And I was about 30 years old when I started college.   During their first semester Dana was in a poetry class and Dana says something in the words of those poets and in the class discussion pushed them to go see the college therapist.   I walked in and said Well you know I think I am depressed and I am think I am gay.     Tell me more about the why you thought you were gay.   Well two things. All that confusion going on in my mind you know am I a boy or girl kind of thing is I do not really know what the hell is going on with me anyway.   Dana says that he did not really feel like a boy like the way other boys do. They kind of felt like an off-kilter kind of boy and what do you call that?   And then all these witch hunts in the Navy got me really started thinking about whether I was or not.   Like maybe those guys were seeing something that Dana could not see yet that was true.   I thought well I must be a gay man because I did not know anything else. I did not know of any other term. We had gay lesbian bisexual and we had cross-dressers.   Oh yeah.   That is what we have.   So you are like okay out of those options which one feels the most like me?   Yeah that was the one I thought was the best option that I was. So I went to gay male and you know I did not date anybody but ...   The therapist that Dana saw ended up recommending that they go join this group on campus.   It was the gay and lesbian alliance which later became the gay and lesbian and bisexual alliance you know because that is how long ago it was.   This would have been 1989-ish?   Yeah.   Like walking into that group. What did that -- here I am. What did it feel like to here you are?   My heart was pounding like mad. You know I did not know what to expect. And they just said Oh welcome. Have a seat. They did not ask who are you dating who you fuck or anything like that.   Those would be some hard first questions. I think I would run if someone started a conversation with that.    Oh you know those were the thoughts that went through my mind. It is like you know?   And you thought there was like an entry visa where you had to like sign off on certain things? Yeah.   Yeah but they were very welcoming. And I thought well you know at least there is a place that I can hang out where people accept me for being different.   Within a short while Dana is not just going to meetings but is protesting with the group. Because around that time something called Amendment 2 was proposed in Colorado.     Amendment 2 because I was up in Colorado. So we got ourselves pretty organized. I went to the Larimer County Republican convention thing.   Oh my God. Really?   Yeah.   Oh so you -- so you became something of an activist.   Yeah I was a spokesman for the student alliance.   Oh so you really found a home there!   It felt pretty good. That is when I started waking up or being woke or whatever the term is.   You were -- I love it!   Starting to. I am a lot more woke now than I was then. It was like I got my first sip of coffee and the caffeine started to like okay ...   Activate your brain? You are like Oh the world looks so different and so many colors!   Yeah!   There was one problem though.   Living as a gay man as I was at that time.   Dana was not gay.   No.   They felt at home as a gay man but they were mostly attracted to women. And towards the end of college in their late 30s ...   Well I was in art school working in the fibers department doing my studio classes and this woman Winnie kept coming in and watching me work. She got to know me I got to know her and we started dating.   Hmm.   We got married.   Really?   Yeah.   Wow! You went all the way to marriage?   Yep.   And this is in -- this is early aughts or like late-90s?   2002.   Okay.   2007 we got divorced. Five years.   Yeah.   Did not work out. We both had issues we were not dealing with.   Dana says this period of their life up through the marriage and through the end of it it was very confusing. They were just trying to figure out where they stood and they were trying out all these terms like ...     Also ...     How did that idea get into the room?   Well because I mean I was hearing more and more about trans people and ...   Okay.   Starting to read a little bit about it and so I am like Well maybe -- maybe ...   And why did that feel more true than gay male or straight male?   Well because I knew this -- there was a feminine quality about myself that I had to recognize okay? So I thought Well if I am not a man I must be a woman. And the only kind of woman I thought I could be was going to be a trans woman.   Meaning to Dana a person who was born male but identified as a woman.   Right.   So you are like Holy crap! So you are like -- hmm that is so interesting that like ...   Well that is where I went to. I cannot explain how. That is the only -- yeah.   It is like in a world where there is limited words you are just -- you are just like trying to figure out the word that fits you.   Right.   It is like these small steps towards a truth.   Mm-hmm. So yeah after the divorce I am looking at myself and saying Okay what is going on here with me? This is not working.   What Dana discovers after the break.   It was so cool.         We are back. Episode five the story of Dana Zzyym. At this point Dana is divorced and feeling really unsure about who they are. They tried boy girl trans bi gay male and marriage. And none of it seemed right.   I was really disheveled. I was really -- I was crying. I was like -- I was not taking care of myself.   Dana says at this point they started to really wonder where is all this confusion coming from?   So I started digging deeper. Okay a lot of stuff is going on with what happened to me as a child.   Dana had always had these like memories some of them hazy of having surgery as a kid. Being like three four five six and being in the hospital.   So I was pretty much there alone most of the time. My grandparents visited me once. My dad was there once.   How many surgeries do you think there were?   I do not know.   Wow. But more than one.   Definitely more than one. Between three and six years old I had multiple. I just do not know how many.   Dana only had like tiny fragments of these memories. I mean it is hard to remember anything when you are three anyways but now in their 50s Dana started to look back and wonder what were those surgeries? Also does that explain why I feel so different down there and like why I am in pain?   At that point I was in such pain that I was walking bowlegged trying to keep anything from touching it.   Oh!   So I started looking up penis surgeries and trying to figure out what happened there.   Oh so you are like Okay. I do not know what happened to me as a kid but I know I had this pain and I know I had these surgeries so maybe they are connected.   Right. So I started looking up that. Looking up a lot of different diagrams on penis surgeries all these different types. And there is thousands of different penis surgeries and I am like Shit I did not know there was that many erectile dysfunction surgeries penis pumps. And I keep looking and I am like I am just trying to match up scar tissues. You know to ...   That was your approach.   That was my approach.   Whew you must have seen some gnarly photos.   Yeah.   And while searching all these photos on the internet Dana did start to see images where the scar tissue like the patterns of the scars looked familiar.   That is when I found this term.     Intersex. And I am like ...   It just popped up on the screen?   It popped up one of these surgery things. Intersex. And I am like What the hell is that? So I typed in intersex. And lo and behold the internet was full of information on intersex. Yeah and bells are really starting to go off ringing in my head going Oh maybe. Maybe.   Yeah.   Yeah and I was just starting therapy at the VA Hospital up in Cheyenne Wyoming. She convinced me to go see a urologist at the VA and he confirmed yes indeed I was intersex.     What does intersex actually even mean in your case? Because it can mean a lot of things. Like what did -- what did the doctors say?   My doctor told me I was born with ambiguous genitalia and that they constructed basically my genitalia to look male.   In other words like Dana was not born with what the doctors would consider male or female genitalia. It was like they had something that seemed to be either an enlarged clitoris or maybe a small penis. It was unclear. And maybe there is a little bit of a vaginal opening. In Dana's case and as is often the case with babies that are born this way parents do not really know what to do and the doctor will basically say Well you got to pick one. And they picked male.   I do not know exactly who made that decision. I think it was my father who said You are not gonna cut that off. Looks like a penis to me. That sounds like my father. But anyway the doctors they constructed a penis. It should have been large clitoris probably and that was it.   How old were you at this point when you figured all this out?   50.   You were 50?   And I am 60 now. 10 years ago.   Whoa! You were five-zero when you finally found out that you were intersex.   Yep.   Dana says when they figured all this out they had two like simultaneous feelings. One ...   I was -- I was livid. Why did not my parents tell me this? Why just basically lying to me my whole life?   Did you call them?   Yes.   What did your mom say?   Not much. She basically was angry back at me. She said you are a boy. You will always be a boy.   Was your father still alive when you found out about the intersex?   Oh yeah. I called him too.   What did he say?   He hemmed and hawed a lot and kind of said he was sorry which is where we start reconciling.   Did he explain where he was coming from at all when -- from when you little?   No not really. But you know I had to learn how to forgive myself for all my anger with my parents and forgive them as well.   But Dana says that like amidst processing that rage ...   I was actually euphoric for almost a year.   Tell me about the euphoria. Why?   Because I finally had an answer. I mean it was a question I had asked and wondered about my entire life up to that point.   The question being ...   Am I a boy or a girl? And the answer was yes.   Both.   Yes. That was euphoric.   What does euphoria feel like to you?   Walking on air. Oh yeah I know what I am. I know what I am. I had to break the binary for myself. That was ...   Break the binary.   Yeah like okay if I am not a man and I am not a woman I must be intersex or hermaphrodite. And that works. But it is not the question I should have been asking it was like Who am I? And those kind of things but ...   You are saying the question you should have been asking is Who am I? Not Am I a boy or girl?   And why -- and why am I here and those kind of things. Those are questions the kind of questions most people ask.   What Dana means is that those are the kinds of questions most people get to ask but they were so forced into like wondering if they were a boy or a girl that they never got to get to like the big existential life questions that most of us you know wrestle with. They were just way back at ground zero.   I was stuck there but I got unstuck.   What does it like mean to like find a word that explains you?   It was so cool. Yeah I think it was probably the happiest times in my life.   You now identify as a herm intersex non-binary queer.   Yep.   Is there anything in that that -- do you feel like fully free and found and sort of euphoric and you now? Or is there anything that still feels confining?   That is pretty much it. I just had a t-shirt made up that says that but it says you know AF at the bottom of it.     As fuck.   Or And funny. I do not know.     You are like That is pretty much it. I gotta put it on a t-shirt. Hope nothing else changes.     Well how are you gonna put that?     Since discovering intersex 10 years ago Dana's become involved in the community repping and traveling to conferences. That is actually what kicked this whole passport thing off. And in May of 2018 Dana and the State Department were back in front of a judge arguing the case on its constitutional merits. In September a judge ruled in favor of Dana saying that the federal government cannot refuse a passport based on basic identity. But two months later the State Department appealed. Another round of oral arguments is expected this coming spring. Since Dana's case began seven states and three cities including Washington DC have non-gendered identification documents.
