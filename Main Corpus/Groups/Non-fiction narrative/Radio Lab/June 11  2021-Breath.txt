      Listener-supported WNYC Studios   Hey yall. I just want to play you a promo for a project thats coming that we are very excited about starting next week actually.   This is a story of a man who changed your world.   Oh wow! See? I woulda claimed this brother right here.   This dude  good God. Why why dont we have like three movies about this dude. Record owner. Lawyer. I mean he is like the vocational MacGyver.   This is how America invades the world.   This is the greatest music of all time.   But then   Its like poof!   Vanished.   Somebody pretending to be somebody that theyre not.   I need to think about why but when this Shima was telling me this story all I could think was oh thats the white boy right there.   Thats hilarious to me.   I dont know what JC is talking about. This is looks like a Black man.   I want you to see what I see.   Once I was at a festival and some guy came up to me and he said What are you? What are you?   My parents put me in front of a mirror. They said that I asked What what am I?   Its the story of an American riddle.   Its a mystery.   Wrapped in a family secret.   Its a mystery   The vanishing of Harry Pace.   A new miniseries from the people that brought you Dolly Partons America.   Jad Abumrad.   And Shima Oliaee.   Coming soon to Radiolab.   That lands next week right here. Okay. Now onto the podcast. This podcast contains some content and language that might be upsetting for sensitive listeners or young children. And  but we do hope you listen cus its pretty awesome. And it comes to you from the duo of Annie McEwen and Matt Kielty.     Uhh. Okay. So how should I start this thingy?   I dont know    I could ask  oh    Probably -- uh huh.   I think this all came out of a question that I had.   Oh sure.   How does a baby take its first breath?   How does a baby --   Like a fetus is spending all this time inside the womb. Right?   Right.   And that  that is like a water world. But then it comes out of the mom and all of a sudden it can breathe in this air world. Thats a crazy transition.   Yeah its weird. I guess I would assume the transition is essentially like water world-breathing water world-breathing born. Its now just breathing differently.     Okay well do you find that at all -- are you at all curious or interested in finding out how it actually works?   No I think I got it.   Okay well Im gonna tell you anyway because the true answer is totally bananas and I just could -- I cant -- anyway. Ill just tell you it.   Tell me.   Okay. First just to set it up lets just review how you and I are breathing right now.   Okay.   So as you might remember from elementary school this whole thing is like a little dosey-doe between the lungs and the heart.   Mhmm.   Okay so blue blood -- blood low in oxygen -- enters the right side of our heart. From there it gets  pushed to the lungs which are  filling with air . Oxygen hops on the blood CO2 hops off .   Okay okay okay.   Returning to the heart the blood is bright red in color because it is filled with oxygen.   Cool.   It is gonna enter the left side of the heart this time -- not the right its gonna go to the other side of the heart. And then from there the red blood gets  fired out around the body. Its gonna go to the brain our legs our arms our organs. Its just like gotta deliver its little oxygen parcels to all our cells.   All our cells.   Mmhmm.  And one more thing  one thing the --  so we have in our hearts so we have these two different sides to it the right and the left.   Yeah.   Between these two sides is a wall. And the red and the blue blood just doesnt mix. Like one side of the heart has the stuff that needs oxygen the other side of the heart has the stuff that has oxygen.   Right.   Okay now were going to learn how a fetus in a womb breathes. Cus its very different.   Right. I mean the baby is surrounded by water.   Pediatric infectious disease doctor Rishi Desai.   And its lungs are full of water.   Oh.   So youre not going to get any oxygen from them. But thats okay because instead of course for a fetus the oxygen comes from   Mom.   The mother.   Right she does the process you just laid out.   Yep and then   This wonderful oxygenated blood thats bright red   Gets sent down to the placenta. The placenta grabs the oxygen and oxygen and puts it into the fetus blood. Okay so things get a little weird here.   Absolutely.   Red blood leaves the placenta through the umbilical cord   Goes in the belly button.   And then through a small special tube a baby tube that you and I no longer have.   Weird.   It gets shunted into a giant vein that zooms it up to the heart.   It goes into the right atrium which is where blood normally goes.   Now if it was you and me this would then go to the lungs but it doesnt go to the lungs because the lungs are just pretty much useless.   The lungs are full of water right?   Theyre just hanging there like these soggy raisins.   This sounds disgusting.   So instead of going to the lungs that blood goes through   Trap door.   Oh.   Theres a door.   In the heart.   In the heart?   Theres a door in the wall of the heart.   Between the two atriums left and right.   In you and me the two atria are completely separate walled off. But in the baby there is this special little door.   Okay   It has a special little flap that opens one way.   That little trap door is flopped open.   So the blood all mixes together and youve got this combination of fresh you know oxygenated blood from the placenta and old blood from the rest of the babys body.   Purplish maroonish blood right?   Which then gets pumped out to the rest of the baby body. Goes to the brain goes to the legs. Goes and nurtures its cells blah blah blah blah blah. Eventually it gets back into the placenta where the carbon dioxide hops off   And then mom will carry that in her blood --   Oh man.   To her own right atrium and then to her own lungs and then breathe that out.   Wow.   Got it?   Got it.   Got it okay. So this system with the special baby tube and the trap door heart and the mixing blood and all that at the moment the baby is born has to somehow transform into the system that you and I have   Within seconds.   Woah.   Okay so lets go to -- or do you have any questions or can we go to labor?   No no no yeah. It all makes sense.   Labor labor labor. Okay. Um bah bah bah bah bah. Labor begins.   As moms squeezing and as the baby is coming through the birth canal its a little bit like wringing a towel dry.   All that squeezing and squishing is pushing this water out of the babys lungs and   Into the babys body.   Wait what?   Like we just kind of absorb the water. Like our bodies are like .   Wait -- Internally?   Yes!   Weird.   Okay so labor labor labor labor. Squish squish squish squish squish. And then pooh!   Bah!   The baby comes out of the mother.   The moment a baby is born its extremely wet.   And for the first time in its life its cold. Its never been cold before.   Oh.  Actually if babies arent dried and swaddled...   The baby can lose a lot of heat right away and it can die from hypothermia very quickly.   Oh my god. I never thought of the shock that is.   Yeah. But its also useful.   When that cold hits   The skin sends little signals to the babys breathing center in the nervous system. And this breathing center is just waking up. Its like someone is rapping loudly on its bedroom door wake up. Wake up! Its time! And its all groggy like wait what do I -- ?      Okay as thats happening the umbilical cord that has been supplying this baby its oxygen its nutrients its everything is   Getting super tight.   This thing is already beginning to close.   Thats insane.   So theres no blood coming in through that umbilical vein.   That means theres no oxygen getting to the baby but it also means that that CO2 in the body is beginning to build.   The baby is suffocating?   Well a baby comes out and looks blue right?   Oh.   Its blue because its not breathing yet.   Huh.   Its like its never breathed in its life.   But this baby taking a breath it has to happen. And it has to happen fast   Meanwhile the carbon dioxide levels are rising. Until finally that little breathing center woken up by the cold skin snaps into action. And   All of sudden       The brain triggers       The baby takes in a big breath. And with that breath   The nervous system is like go! As the oxygen hits the lungs   All the dominos start falling.   All the muscles keeping blood out of the heart.   In unison relax.   Blood is just rushing into the lungs picking up all this fresh oxygen. The lungs are opening up like two sails filling with wind. The blood then rushes from the lungs back to the heart as it enters the left side that door thats been pushed open the whole time   Boom.   Slams shut.   The wall is sealed.   The heart is divided.   Now youve got no mixing anymore. That door will never open again.   And that special baby tube  I mentioned starts to close.   Protein is kind of like sewing it shut.     Oh my...   Wow.             The baby is now breathing on its own.         Its funny because it is a little story of the necessity of trauma.     That the deeply traumatic act of coming into existence in the air breathing land world.   The severity of it and the harshness of it forces you to adapt.  Right.  In order to survive.  Right.    Of course thats just the first breath. Then theres another. And another. And another. And another. And another. And another  Alright.  Im Annie McEwen.  And Im Matt Kielty.  This is Radiolab. And today we are going to do a show all about breath. About how after that first breath and the next and the next breath  From the moment you are born to the moment you find yourself in right now these breaths can be long they can be shallow they can be short they can be quick they can be harsh they can be quiet they can be soft. But like whatever they are they set some sort of like rhythm in our lives.  Which makes you kind of wonder like where do those rhythms come from?  And we just figured this sounds totally like a question for  Molly Webster.  Our Senior Correspondent.   Yeah?   Oh yeah.   Oh no.      Is that good?   Yeah.   Alright so I ended up talking to this guy.   Mark Krasnow Professor of Biochemistry at Stanford University.   Okay perfect.   So Mark is a lung researcher.   Its my favorite topic. Its my favorite topic obviously.      And were going to pick up with him in like the 00s.   Kind of a natural extension.   So he actually has this question of just like well what is actually controlling the rhythm of the lungs?   Exactly.   Like what makes you breathe?   Exactly. Yeah.   So he starts doing some research and he finds this paper that says if you go to the base of your brain   In whats called the brain stem.   Its kind of the space that goes up between that groove --   Oh that divot?   That you have at the back of your skull.   Oh yeah.  Yeah.   Yeah. Yeah its right buried deep below that.   I feel it right now.   And its right there that Mark learned that there is this little clump of neurons.   That are actually initiating     Each breath.     With every single pulse they send a signal down the spinal cord.   To your diaphragm and the tiny muscles between your ribs.   Telling them to expand. And they send another signal telling them to contract. And this is just what these neurons do.   They are the pacemaker neurons.     Huh.   Huh.   So there are 86 billion neurons in your brain and its just this clump of 8000 that do this vital thing.   That seems very small.   It does seem very small does it not?   Yes!    And so   So Mark came across this paper actually by this guy named Jack.   I consider Jack the father of the of the field.   Just a really quick Jack Feldman shout out.   Wonderful.   But when Mark came across Jacks research   We found out about   He just had this really simple question.   Which was hey are all of these neurons are they all the same as one another? Or are they different from one another? And so we started interrogating these neurons.   And so he and some colleagues what they did was they started looking at this group of neurons   In a mouse brain.   Under a microscope.   And   What had seemed to be a uniformed mass of beating.   It turns out these neurons werent all alike. There are over 50 different types --   Really?   Of a pacemaker neuron.   Huh.   Mark was just like okay weird.   You know what -- why are they different and what do they do thats special?   So to start in mice Mark decides to focus on this specific group.   These 200 neurons from the breathing pacemakers.   And basically with some molecules and a syringe.   We can very precisely remove just those neurons.   And so Marks team goes in they shut down the 200 neurons. Mouse is happy mouse is alive. And basically what happens is mouse stops sighing.   What?   Which was like woah.   So I didnt know this but mice sigh.   Aww.   Huh.   That is so cute.   And so thats just saying like oh these 200 neurons control sigh.   And they are the only neurons apparently in the brain that have this specific function.   Weird.   Yes. And thats not all. In another experiment they knocked out again like 150 neurons and the rate of exhalation changes. So like you know you can go  and you go . And you can say I want to exhale for four seconds?   Mmhmm.   Or your body just does it naturally at some rhythm? They found that when they took out this one group of neurons the rate of exhalation got much longer.   Huh.   Huh. Interesting.   And so theyre like oh interesting. So theyre starting to put together this little visual map of what all of these different neurons do. They almost have a function right?   Yeah so this was   And so they you know they go to another group of neurons.   You know roughly 150 neurons.   Knock them out but this time   Very very disappointing.   Nothing happens. So like thats weird. Did really nothing change you know? And they realize a few days later that something did change.   That hey these mice look chillaxed.      They are very calm.   Theyre just kind of licking their fur and hanging out in place.   Chill. Mellow.   Its like what are what are these neurons?   Give me those.   And they start looking at what the neurons are connected to. You know how neurons can have those long tentacle projections? And those let them communicate with other neurons?   Uh huh.   And realizes that where they actually go is directly to the fight or flight center of the brain.   Wow.   Oh. Wow. Cool.   And so the story they put together is that this group of neurons what its probably doing is sending updates about the status of the pacemaker to the fight or flight regions saying like Were working everything is okay over here. And theyre sending these little signals giving it updates and if somethings wrong they can send a thing straight into fight or flight and be like May day may day breath is -- breath is a mess.   Mmm.   Hmm. Okay.   Like breath is a mess we need to fix it.   Huh. I guess I think of it -- would it be the other way of like you see something really scary fight or flight then sends a signal to the breathe  the breath pacemaker being like Pick up the pace?   Well so -- so this starts where -- this is where you can really start tripping off on some cool gnarly things about breath.   Thats what I want to do.    Lets do it!   Thats what Im here for.   Okay lets do it.   Great.   So Mark walked me through this very cool thing.   So there are two great pacemakers in our body. One that many people know about is the pacemaker of the heart which you know beats every second. And its -- its located right in the organ that it controls. Its right there in the heart.   So theres actually pacemaker cells in your heart that do the rhythm of the beating.   Oh really?   Theyre directly on the organ that they make beat.   Thats crazy.   But with breath the other great pacemaker its located far from the organ that it controls. Its located in the brain.   And once you put once you put breath into the brain you allow evolution to put more on the breath than just the mechanical function.   Mmm.   Like it starts getting integrated into the emotional centers of the brain and the anxiety centers of the brain.   Whoa.   And those parts of the brain can impact and regulate breath. A sigh. And theres you know laugh you know or a cry or even speech. You know all of those those are actually breathing.   So yes Matt to answer your question. You see something scary a signal gets sent from the fight or flight to the breath pacemaker saying Pick up the pace you know. But what Marks research shows is its going both ways. Theres cross talk theres deep integration happening.   And the other key aspect of the breathing pacemaker compared to the cardiac pacemaker is you can consciously control the breathing pacemaker.   Thats the intr -- yeah.   You can hold your breath at least for a certain period of time and you can change the output of the breathing pace -- so you can override and alter the breathing pacemaker.   Is that why if I take like a   -- like a big deep breath I can actually calm myself down?   Yeah but that is the way that youre getting control of this communication between the breathing pacemaker and the fight or flight neurons.   Huh.   And so in talking to Mark I feel like in a way he almost gave me a scalpel to get inside my own brain and control it.   Ah.   Like if I actually change my breathing it will change this breath pacemaker region and it will send an Im chill signal to the fight or flight directly and it will calm down.   Hmm. Wow. Its like you cross a blood-brain barrier and youre on the ground floor communicating -- communicating with the parts.   Hmm.   Yeah it just -- I was -- I just felt like -- and so like last night when I couldnt -- when I kept waking up like when I was sleeping I was like okay Im just going to breathe slowly and then -- almost being like Hi neurons!   Yeah.    Like Im breathing slowly now so you can send a signal to fight or flight that Im okay. And like I can conduct this whole system. Like I can work the system.   This next story is about when the system tries to conduct you.   I saw it on Facebook. It was a Facebook post with Mike Browns body laying on the ground with his arms sticking out and his legs sticking out. You see Darren Wilson whos the police officer sort of standing over him looking down on him. So once I heard about what happened to Mike Brown     I was out there.     This is Justin Hansford. Hes a law professor at Howard University. And back in 2014 he was living just outside Ferguson.   I was mostly curious at first. During the day it was just a march. People chanting and singing and clapping their hands. But also there are people who are very upset. They are yelling. They are screaming. They are crying. By the time it starts to get dark police start telling people which way to walk. Giving people orders. Tell you to go home. They actually have tanks on the streets. Helicopters in the sky.     Pretty soon after that pop pop pop pop pop. Then you start seeing the gas. People screaming in pain trying to rub their eyes. I just broke. And bolted.   But after that first night Justin returned to the protests again and again.   Yeah I would go out everyday especially during that first what 10 14 period. And   Whenever those canisters began to fly   Whenever the tear gas came   He always did the same thing.   I ran.   I ended up talking to Justin because this past summer seven years after his experience in Ferguson at the height of the George Floyd demonstrations even if you werent on the streets at night every morning you were seeing pictures and videos of these massive clouds of smoke hanging over people. It really began to feel like every time there was a demonstration or protest or a march it would end with tear gas. And I couldnt stop wondering like how did we get here? How did we get to this place where the go-to weapon for police responding to these protests is this gas?   Hello?   Hello.   And the first thing that popped up was it basically began in WWI.     Right. First World War you had trenches...   I learned about all this from Anna Feigenbaum.   I am an associate professor of digital media and communication at Bournemouth University.   And she said those trenches...   They were like protection and a trap right?   People would just hide in their trenches and then shoot at each other and then hide in their trenches.   It was really difficult to advance on either side.   You couldnt move up on the enemy soldiers without getting shot. So both sides would just end up sitting there. So the question became how do we get the enemy soldiers out of their trenches? And the answer   Tear gas.   Tear gas.   France was the first to fire it according to the most agreed historical story of World War I.   August 1914 the French fired tear gas grenades at the German line. Strange smoke crept across no mans land and down into the trenches. And given what tear gas does we can imagine that the German soldiers started to rub their eyes in pain tears started streaming down their faces. And then as they breathed the smoke in they began to cough. They coughed and coughed. Their throats started to burn. Their chest tightened up. And at that point panic set in. They left the safety of their trenches and began to run. And of course then ...   You can shoot them.   The French opened fire. And this moment sort of broke the seal for chemical warfare. Soon after Germany brought chlorine gas and mustard gas these far more harmful gases to the battlefield. Other countries made and deployed their own gases. And eventually gas just became this terror of World War I.   Right.   So the First World War ended what happened?   So youve got people who were like all gas warfare is inhumane. It creates that kind of psychological torture of the psyche that is just not acceptable.   And the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 you may have heard of it.   I know all about it.   This is like at the end of World War I the Allies came together to figure out what to do about Germany. But at the same time part of it was like what do we do about gas?   Uh huh.   And it basically kicked off this whole debate which would eventually get all these gases including tear gas banned from use in war.   Hmm.   But one of the key things they did at the Treaty of Versailles was to make a distinction between the different gases. So there was...   The really bad kind.   Like chlorine gas.   Yeah.   Which could straight up kill people.   And the not so bad kind.   Like tear gas. which eventually got labeled non-lethal.   Right.   And Anna says   That distinction is really really important.   Because it left the door open for people to argue that even if we cant use tear gas in the trenches abroad maybe we can use it on the streets back home. Okay so fast forward to the end of the First World War. Theres a recession theres been a recent influx of Black folks in Northern cities looking for opportunities that they dont have down South. And a lot of white soldiers just getting back from overseas see these Black folks as threats to their jobs. And in dozens of different cities across the states gangs of white men roam the streets burning Black homes and businesses and killing hundreds of Black people. And Black soldiers whod also recently returned home from war were fighting back. This became known as the Red Summer of 1919. And in the midst of all this there was also a wave of labor strikes. And some police forces began writing to the War Department requesting tear gas. This is from the New York Police Department in August 1919...     From the Department of Public Safety in Norfolk Virginia in September...     And the War Department is like No way. But these requests that said Send us tear gas they kept coming. And in the meantime there were people within the War Department who were thinking maybe this isnt a bad idea. In particular there was a general named Amos Fries who was a huge proponent of tear gas. And he and his network started to arrange these big demos with these police departments.   So he had like 200 police officers go out into a big field. You know a bunch of police pretended to be protesters and the other police were the police.   The pretend protester police got shot with tear gas. And Amos Fries made sure there were some reporters there to see it.   In the article there is these lines of like The grown men were crying like babies.   Showing that just by restricting their breath he can dominate these guys. Make them run or coward or give up. But the key part of his argument the thing that made tear gas so special was that    A couple hours later everyone's gonna be back to normal and fine and you will not have any you know blood on your record.   As the riots and labor strikes and civil unrest continued tear gas this thing that could control a crowd without killing started to win the day. And if you search the archives of the New York Times around 1921 1922     You start to see tear gas slowly seep into its pages.     At first its only a few a year.       By the time you get into the 30s     There are hundreds of instances of tear gas being used all over the country.     And so it got to the point where wherever there was a crowd of unhappy people...     There was tear gas.     The Civil Rights Movement.     The Anti-Vietnam War protests.   The anti-globalization summit had lots of tear gas.     Occupy got super tear gassed.   And I talked to this guy at the Omega Research Foundation his name is Neil Corney. And part of his job is looking into the use of tear gas worldwide.   Hmm.   And he told me that in the last 10 years or so the use of tear gas has just exploded. And that is also of course when the Black Lives Matter Movement really you know began and picked up steam. And over that time Justin Hansford kept showing up at protests. He became a legal observer and even went out to accompany Mike Browns family to Geneva to testify at the UN. And he says that he probably ran from tear gas about 30 times.   I -- there were times when I could not escape it. Multiple times. Really the worst time for me I was actually in my car.   Oh wow.   I have asthma. And -- you know a lot of especially Black kids have asthma in part because where we have had to grow up. But anyway I know that if I got tear gas in a major way it could be lights out. So I ran to my car. And I could not drive through the protesters because the protesters were on the street. So I had to drive sort of perpendicular to get around where the protest was. Unfortunately everybody else was trying to do the same thing. So I was about one block over from where they had deployed the tear gas and I was stuck. I double checked to make sure my windows were -- I tried to like roll up more. Tried to turn off my vents. I knew when the tear gas had entered the car cus I could recognize the smell almost like laundry detergent but it is more pungent. I was panicking a bit because I did not have my inhaler on me at the time.   Dang.   And I covered my mouth but I knew there wasnt much I could do. I was coughing a lot. I was coughing uncontrollably. Tears were coming down. I never knew if it would just hit. Like I would have an asthma attack and just hit. Just panic.   As his chest clenched and tightened as he struggled to breath   Youre in flight mode. Like youre frantically searching for whats going to keep you alive and youre not finding it.   Its sort of impossible hearing this story to not think about that phrase I cant breathe thats become a rallying cry for the whole movement. Its sort of sitting over all of this as both a metaphor and literal experience.   Yeah I mean it is seared into our minds because the phrase was repeated and gets repeated in people's final moments of their life. It was Eric Garner and George Floyd it was their last words. And that the chokehold and that position of putting someone prone on the ground with your knee on their back even if it interferes with their breath.   So the panic in that moment is in his body but its also in the world he lives in and his history.   You know we have history of lynching in this country. People hanging from trees couldnt breathe. It was often a type of suffocation that happened in our history  its a legacy of that. Its always a choking.   And all of that settles on Justin in that moment in the car.   I just sort of put my head down and I sort of just steeled myself to take whatever is going to take place.   He says it was in some way a feeling of resignation.   I was -- I was resigned. I have to be honest with you.   But also resolve.   Imagine me driving my hands on the steering wheel. I smell it and I just start hanging -- I just hang my head and just like shake my head and just say Alright now here we go. So yeah.   Um. I wish there was like a lighter question I can now ask you.    Yeah ask something light.   What do you do to -- what do you do to feel better? What do you do to unplug and relax? Or do you not? Like or do you just -- you just write papers. Or do you have -- like do you have a cat? Like what do you do?     Oh you know what I like -- I like to go jogging. And especially if it is warm outside and there is sun and I will listen to some music. I like to jog when it is very sunny out. I just like to get out there early in the morning listen to the birds sing for a little while and then just turn up the Janet Jackson and just make it happen.     In keeping with something lighter.   Matt do you know what you are talking about? Do you have any idea what you are talking about?    Did it turn out that no he did not?   Yeah.   Wait who are you? I have no idea who you are.    Me?   Yeah. Maybe we should maybe we should back up. If you could if you could just like say who you are.   Okay so like when do you want me to start doing this? Like now?    Yeah.   5 4 --   You guys are nuts. Okay. So Im Marcia Mogelonsky. Im the Director of Insight at Mintel Food and Drink.   Director of Insight?   Insight. Yes.   What is a Director of Insight?   A person who sits on the phone with people like you and talks about where mints came from.   Which is sort of true because Marcia works for this market research analytics company and shes in the food department.   I am the category expert for confectionery. So Im in charge of --   Wow.   Chocolate gum and mints. Yes. This is like the perfect job.   When you started what jumped out to you about mints?   What was interesting to me is the -- the line between a mint a candy and a breath freshener is very fuzzy unless you are going for breath freshening strips or what we used to you know squirt into our mouths. I do not know if they even exist anymore --   Oh my God.   But like Binaca.   Oh Binaca --   Binaca --   Binaca was great.   And then then there were those Listerine breath freshening --.   Strips!   Strips that dissolve on your tongue --   Oh those are gross --   Those are awful!   Those are really weird. Yeah.  They were really weird and they were gross tasting. But now --   That is feels like some market innovation though.   Oh it was when it was first launched but it does not really exist anymore. It is been replaced by other innovations like --   What is -- what are the new ones?   Yeah what is the hot thing right now?   Mint -- Just minty flavored strong minty flavored everything. Like like those Altoids that come in strong minty flavors.   M-hmm.   But this is a really sall -- small slice really small slice of the confectionery industry. This is not you know stop traffic we have got new mint! Because it is intended for two purposes basically. Well maybe three. Number one is breath freshening. Number two is to wake yourself up because you are having a slump and you are really bored so you reach for something little at your desk. You are not going to eat a bag of Doritos when you are having a slump.   Speak for yourself.   Yeah.   Exactly. But most people are looking for a pick me up and that pick me up could be a chocolate. It could be a cookie. It could be just a mint because you do not want to have anything too big. You just want something different. You want something to chew on.   And a mint is kind of stimul -- it is stimulating --   A stimulate. Or you want something to chew on which is to get rid of nervous tension. Or stop yourself from doing something worse like eating or smoking.   Right. And Number four is kissing.    Well yes of course.   Okay well so -- so last time we spoke you had said something that totally surprised me. Cus I just called you up being like I dont know breath breath mints what? Like whats going on? And you said that the market is down.   Yeah. The market for mints and gum sales have declined. Why have sales declined? It is not because we all want to have stinky breath. Well that might be part of it. But the major reason is those are really impulse purchases. On the way to work. Getting on the train before you get on the train there is a kiosk right by the subway stop. You go oh I could use some mints my breath's a little stinky. So you pick up a package of mints and you throw them in your purse or your pocket or whatever.   Right.   That does not happen anymore because no one's going anywhere! Because you see them and you realize there is a need.   Yeah right.   And the need is you have to freshen your breath. You have to freshen your breath because you are going to go have some very garlicky food for supper and then you are going on a date afterwards. Or you are going to work and you have a big meeting and you are going to have to meet the boss. But you happen to have had garlic chicken for lunch which was a big mistake believe me.   Garlic everywhere.    Or you are at the bar and you have a drink and then you meet someone and you want to talk to them and you do not want to appear like you have been drinking. You want to have fresher breath.   Oh yeah. At the bar I was not drinking I swear. Just eating my garlic chicken.   You can tell by my spearmint breath I have not been drinking at all.   Exactly. You do not normally have them but suddenly you have a reason to buy them.   Yes.   It is not a planned purchase. It is usually an impromptu purchase.   There is also something like the idea of like breath mints or something hopeful about that. Like you reach for it because you have a date later or because you have a meeting later. Or there is like you are going to be a person in the world and this is going to help you. And it is going to be like your assist or your life saver or you know whatever.   Yeah. Yeah.   And so this like lack of reaching for these like little hopeful things that will like you know push us to be that much better in our day or that much more confident. It is like just interesting that we are in that time --   Yeah.   Time right now.   And I think that things will improve.   Yeah.   I think that this has just been a blip in the general universe of things. This has been a wholesale change in people's behaviors that people just did not anticipate. No one ever thought we would grind to a halt --   Right?   Where we spent the past year staring at our own four walls and not meeting people. And going to the movies going to concerts going shopping going socializing all that stuff just ground to a halt.   Right.   But I think that things will improve. I think that people are going to be desperate to resume.   Be poppin mints like crazy.   Oh yeah. And sneezing their way from here to there. So.  You guys seriously do not sneeze when you eat a strong mint?   No.   No but what? --   I do like the idea though of like the sign that we have -- we are getting out of the darkness is the breath mint rebounding.   Yeah. Yeah.   I ended up calling another retail sales firm. They told me that in the pandemic breath mint sales dropped off by 40. But that since March with each passing day they started to see mint sales tick back up.     Were gonna keep breathing.     Just after this man holds this note for as long as he can.   Be right back.                     Annie.  Matt.  Radiolab.  Okay. Are you ready?  Yeah. Im ready.  Okay. I sense a disturbance in the air. My chest feels tighter something is not quite right. And then I see it. Flames are licking the bottoms of trees... hundreds of miles away. From my home in San Francisco I can sense a wildfire coming before most people because of how my respiratory system is built. My diaphragm which is slowly weakening over time gives me a heightened sensitivity to secrets in the air.  Because my diaphragm is weak I use a ventilator to help push the air out of my lungs. Without this machine my own CO2 would gather in my body and I would die slowly from a buildup of acidic blood. This nearly happened when I was 18 and first experienced respiratory failure. My brain went fuzzy and in the ER I remember seeing my arterial blood drawn from my body starved of oxygen. Thick and black as ink. But I clawed my way back and lived to tell the tale that is if you are willing to listen. When the coronavirus broke out many states ranked people like me who need a machine to breathe lower down on the list of those deserving medical treatment. New York went even further. According to the ventilator allocation guidelines on the New York State Department of Healths website it says that hospitals are allowed to take peoples personal ventilators and give them to other patients in times of triage if they seek acute care. In essence they can steal breaths from people like me and give them to others.  But my body that the state calls broken I call an oracle. Its not just the distant flames that I can see before you. But its the cold math that calculates the value of my life an algorithm of expendability that -- whether you realize it or not -- can come for you as well. My name is Alice Wong. And Im a disabled activist writer and all-around troublemaker.   Okay so this next thing comes from   Yeah you sound great.   Alright.   Writer Mosi Secret who typically does some pretty serious journalism.   Yeah I mean I have mostly done investigative reporting or or in-depth narrative writing on issues of race or issues of criminal justice. And man this just sounds like you know like -- you know fun.    Imagine that yeah.   You know but I will say that this did not end up being a totally silly thing.   So thing begins   Maybe two or three years ago there was this video that went around     From Funkmaster Flexs show.   On Hot 97.     And to set up the significance of what youre about to hear. So Flex hes got a radio show a lot of rappers come on.   And it is a regular feature that Funkmaster Flex has where people kind of come on and freestyle.     And there are a lot of people who are     A lot of younger newer rappers who come on and you know who are doing some -- they think theyre doing something.       They think theyre doing something. Because in these freestyles     Which are very very good. There are moments of     Rappers who are kind of stalling out.     Rappers who want to do multiple takes. Rappers who can only go for a minute or two.   And so theyre like okay lets bring in the OG and show them how its done.     So this video is a video   Of     The rapper Black Thought.     Hes sitting at a desk next to Flex. Hes got on a beige fedora sunglasses.     And     He kind of like destroys it.     And what unfolds in this freestyle   Is 10 minutes of him not missing a beat.     And the beat was very fast and the rhymes were like intricate.     And what you start to see in this video is Black Thought keeps going its like about three minutes in   You can kind of see this motion in his body like he starts to almost like bounce in his seat.   At about five minutes   He breaks a sweat.     By six minutes the sweat is dripping down his face. By seven minutes you know this guy is entering a trance.     By eight minutes you can see Flexs face just like oh shit. By nine minutes you can tell hes just pushing it out.     And finally just under 10 minutes 10 minutes straight Black Thought lands this freestyle.       And after that there were all these discussions like ooh you know is he one of the greatest rappers of all time? Did we not know this? And I was talking to some friends about it -- like a lot of people were talking about it -- and one of my friends was like Well you know he can do that because he can circular breathe. And I was like Huh. That sounds crazy that he can circular breathe while rapping.     And I was just like oh okay that explains it. That explains it.   Because for Mosi he knew the power of circular breathing. As a kid Mosi got really into jazz when he picked up a saxophone.     And I was -- you know in the beginning I was really into horn players. You know John Coltrane and Sonny Rollins these tenor saxophone players. These guys became heroes because thats what I was trying to learn.   And so as a kid he had heard about circular breathing.   Almost had this mythic quality like this kind of superhuman uncanny ability that some people have to sustain sound for minutes and minutes or hours and hours. Like Sonny Rollins I knew that he could do it. Kind of do these solo improvisations and they were incredible.   And Mosi always thought if you could just learn how to get there learn this technique you could enter this other realm.   But I was not the best practicer.     And also I just had this feeling that people were listening to me --   Yeah.   And I felt you know a little embarrassed that I wasnt good yet.   Aww.    So   Eventually he put down the sax.   So I hadnt thought about saxophone or circular breathing for a long time.   But then     Huh. That sounds crazy.   And so   Talking about this episode that you guys are doing   Mosi pitched us this story about the freestyle about circular breathing we were just like yeah?   So   He went off reporting.   Basically internet research.   Ended up on Reddit.   On this -- I read this subreddit where its like Oh my god did you guys see that flow? You know why he can do that its because he can circular breathe. And then people were like Oh man thats so amazing. Thats why hes so great.     And then you know like a few posts down theres somebody who comes in. Hes like Well actually I play clarinet and it is technically impossible. It is actually impossible for one to use circular breathing while speaking.   Huh.   Hmm.   Yeah.   And I should say really quick in hindsight went back and watched the Black Thought video.     And was like Ooooh.     Hes breathing all the time.     This is a super cut -- this is a super cut of him breathing. I didnt count the breaths but its like a lot -- clearly a lot of breaths. Like sort of hes just breathing like a normal person but doing this extraordinary thing.   Yes. The artistry there is amazing.   So like he is a genius but hes not doing the crazy godly mythic thing of circular breathing.   But   But then Mosi dropped another bomb.   From what I understand like most horn players can do it.   Oh.   Oh.   I know sorry.   Wah wah. No its okay.    I mean there are videos on YouTube showing you how to do it.   Oh thats interesting.   So in Kenny Gs how-to video on YouTube he says--   Ah Im sorry excuse me?   You have to watch the Kenny G tutorial.       Because just everything about it says you know 1990s smooth jazz Kenny G.   Yes.     And then theres stuff like     You can circular breathe in ten minutes.         So it is -- there is a little bit of oh I could have been doing this when I was 12. You know like damn this is a lot easier than I thought it was.   But is it really?   Hello.   More people! Hello. Hows it going?   So Annie and I went out into the world.   We are at the Brooklyn Music School in downtown Brooklyn.   To a room at the Brooklyn Music School which had a little vibraphone piano. And also some flautists.     Its called a head piece.   There were three of them.   Your name is?   My name is Adelaide.   I am Matt. Nice to meet you.   There was Addie.   My name is Sadie-Lou.   Sadie-Lou?   And I like watermelon.   So Addie Sadie-Lou both 10 years old.   Oh and Hannah Hannah. How old are you?   12.   And Hannah the 12 year old.   And which grade is that?   Seventh.   Also there was Shaya the flute instructor and a couple parents.   Did your parents explain to you what--what we are trying to do? Do you know about circular breathing?   No.   I think it is like breathinglike a breathing technique where you are breathing with your nose and your mouth at the same time.   Exactly.   Yeah. Well I can actually kind of tell you how to do it.   Okay.   So Mosi tried to teach us how to do it and we tried to teach the kids.   Okay maybe we should take a second practice step one.   So if you just blow up your cheeks.   Put some air in your mouth cheeks.   And then breathe through your nose while you have that air in your cheeks.   Mhmm.  Okay. Well we got some fast learners. Okay. Does everybody feel good about step one?   Yes.   The second thing that you will do is while you have your cheeks blown up use your fingers to press in your cheeks   Squeezing the air out of your cheeks   Out of your taut lips.     Very elegant little ...   Slowly I should say.     And so the skill is learning to force that air out of your mouth with your cheek muscles --   Wow!   Rather than with your fingers.   Oh!   And you are doing that at the same time as you are inhaling.   Okay. Okay.    Okay how do we feel about step two? Okay great.   And then the last part is which is where it gets really difficult --   How do you refill the cheeks?   Is thatexactly. How do you refill the cheeks?   So one of the things that we need for this is a straw. So there is three straws.   And this is the really tricky part is you have to while you are pushing the air out with your cheek muscles you have to inhale to get some more air back in there. And you just keep it going continuous flow.   Also I will hand out -- I will hand out jars of water ...   So no you get a glass you fill it half with water you fill your cheeks with air...   Blow through the straw into the water.   And the way that you know that you are doing it correctly is that the water obviously will bubble and you want those bubbles to continue --   Right. Forever.   Yeah forever.   Okay. I will start at three. Three two one breathe.     And what we saw was our two 10-year-olds -- God love them -- after about 20 seconds when their faces were just like pure pushing out air   Oh my god.   They took a breath. But then we noticed ...   Are you -- are you already doing it?   Our 12-year-old Hannah...   Go!   Yeah look at her.   Was totally doing it.   Hannah how?   What?   I think you got it!   Oh Shayas still going too.   Look at that!   Oh my God!   Oh Shayas got  Shayas got big bubbles over here.   Shaya the flute instructor picked it up.   I think your mom's a champion.   Addie's mom got it.   She wants to stop!    Woohoo. Good job!   Mom that was great! .   That was awesome.   Whooo!   Nice job mom.   So yeah. Circular breathing. Easy-peasy fun for the whole family. Although I will say that actually doing it on the flute proved really hard. And to be fair ...     Kenny G said it took him a long time to master it. But yeah it turns out it is pretty simple.   Yeah.   I am just -- I am just wondering given that and the sort of let down of Black Thought and horn players and whatnot like was there anything in your reporting that sort of jumped out to you?   Well I think that -- I mean a lot of it has to do with the idea of the breath. So like in Western music especially or Western theory kind of revolves around the phrase the musical phrase. And the phrase is something that really is modeled on the human voice and on breath.   Oh interesting.   So there is something that begins and there is something that ends. And ones breath and ones phrasing is highly personal and it is like  it is the signature. It is -- the way you breathe the way you speak is what makes your music musically yours.   Huh.   You know its interesting I havent really ever considered the way in which my breath is intrinsically tied to my speech in the way thats distinct in some way.   Yeah yeah. It made me think about the way in which it defines me or in a way that was kind of a signature of mine. The way that I have a rhythm -- theres a rhythm to the way that I speak which is entirely my own. And theres a rhythm to the way that you speak that is entirely your own. And that -- and that it might even be possible to recognize that rhythm absent the words that Im uttering.   Mmmm.   Huh.   That theres something -- that theres a sound that we produce with our breath that is so kind of innately ours. That -- yeah its almost like a fingerprint.   Right.   Huh.   Right. And then it becomes this really interesting tension of then how do you escape that or how can you?   And so circular breathing then becomes this way of okay if this is my limitation who am I or what am I if I dont have that limitation if I can kind of sustain my breath indefinitely?     So this is the piece Moto Perpetuo.   Which was this violin solo known to be kind of one of the hardest passages of classical music.   And in the 1960s Rafael Mendez came across it   And played it for trumpet.   This version is a version by Wynton Marsalis.   And its like four minutes of just like unbroken very high tempo sound.     Thats two minutes.     Three minutes.     And it just keeps going on and on and on and on   And another   And on.   And another.   And on.   And another.   And on.   And another.   And on.   And another.   And on.   Indefinitely.               And on and on and on and on and on --   And another    And on and on and on and on and on --   And another --   And on and on and on and on and on --   And another!    Annie?   Yes.   Matt?   Yes.   Its Robert again.   Robert Krulwich.   Former co-host.   I didnt die Im just lying here. Nothing to do this afternoon.     I have a thought. Lets talk about breath.     So we told Robert what we were up to with this breath show. And he came back to us with a tale of a time when the air was so different that the creatures who breathed it were literally transformed. Okay so were talking 300 million years ago or so.   Yeah. The world at that time was wet and warm and very swampy.   And covered in forests filled with very weird looking trees.   Skinny but very tall. Like pencils. With a little like a chicken on top or something like a little feather head sort of top.     And of course what a tree does is it takes in CO2 and pumps out oxygen. So theres oxygen flowing into the sky in great amounts because theres so many trees.   Today our atmosphere is 21 percent oxygen. But back then   The amount of oxygen in the air is something like 31 or 32 percent. Something like that. Thats an oxygen rich -- that would be like going into one of those you know into a greenhouse. Where you feel that very pleasant sensation of just very clear I dunno heady air that you can feel in a greenhouse. Thats -- the whole world was like that at the time.   Oh is that why a greenhouse feels like that?   Yeah!   Id never thought of that!   Yeah. Youre getting a little oxygen high --   Oh! Dang.   When you go into a greenhouse. Its a little bit like maybe wearing a terry cloth robe in a really nice Four Seasons hotel.   Oh yeah.   Air-wise. You get gorgeous air.      Luxury air.   Right.   You finally you finally feel pampered. I guess is what I imagine.   Oh. Its sort of nice to like imagine squishing through that moist warm forest feeling like youre wearing a terry cloth robe at a hotel.   Yes.    But now you may not want to be doing that because of what all this oxygen has done to the bugs.   Oh yeah. You see something very startling going on.   And really quick to understand this startling thing you have to know that both back then and today bugs dont have lungs.   No they dont.   Instead...   They have these little holes all over them. Like a polka dot kind of outside.   And they get the air and thus the oxygen into their bodies through these holes. So breathing for a bug is...   The equivalent of opening a window. You just open your valve and you wait.   Air drifts into the holes and the oxygen in the air feeds the insects cells. Now because the oxygen is sort of just drifting rather than traveling through veins the cells closer to the surface closer to the window get more oxygen. And so if theres not that much oxygen in the air you have to make sure all your cells are really close to the surface. Meaning you have to be little. But when oxygen levels were 30-something percent   The chances of a hungry cell in your body getting a meal has just gone up. And if more cells can feed then you can grow bigger.   And bigger and bigger and bigger.   Theres a spider from that period -- which you know spiders are very leggy animals. But how about a leg thats a foot and a half.   You just like pat them on the head as you pass them by.   Theres a dragonfly that had a wingspan thats about two feet across --   Oh dear god.   Two -- just think about that for a moment. Thats like a seagull in the form of a dragonfly.     So that would be so weird.   Wow.   They have a millipede. There was one that was eight and a half feet long.   Oh my god.   Actually it might have been more like seven feet long. But still.   It would be like a gigantic crocodile in the form of a millipede.   You could just lie on one and read a book as it like slithered along.   Yes it could be a bus you take to the next side of the forest. Lie on its back.    Yeah exactly.   Yeah.   Hmm. I guess like if youre a bug whats in the air totally defines you.   Hmm.   Or set your physical boundaries right? Because theres so much more oxygen in the air. Um. Oh.     Thats Rick Burns. Oh. Hey. Im doing an interview but can I call you back later? Okay.   Some things never change.     Thats true. Ive never figured out how -- Ive never remembered to turn off the phone when we go do these things.     So four years ago is actually when we thought about doing this episode. And the reason the impetus for that was actually because of this small piece of tape that we heard the sound of a breath.   Do you do anything else? Do you have like a hobby?   And that breath and that tape came to us from New York Times audio producer Annie Brown.   Yeah. This came about because I was applying for a job at the New York Times.   This is 2017.   And I got an assignment that I had to find a story that was about controlling an urge or an impulse that was surprising and gave you some kind of instructions on how to do it. And I really wanted to get this job and I found these two people who figured out that controlling the urge to breathe was largely psychological. That actually its like really not a physical thing.   So     The two people Annie found are these free divers who live in Canada.   Theyre just like the most famous trainers of breath holding.   And Annie flew out to Canada spent a day training with them in their house and then went to her hotel pool.   The Comfort Inn on Vancouver Island.     With her instructor Kirk.     And so Annie is standing next to the pool.   I got on a hoodie sweatsuit.   This place reeks of chlorine.   And like the air is so thick you know? Its just that kind of -- its so familiar to me.       Like thats how it feels on the pool deck thats how it felt at that meet I went  you know its just that is a very familiar feeling.     She gets into the pool.     So Im on the side of the pool I am just trying to relax. And so Im like  doing my slow breaths to calm my heart rate down.     Now most people can hold their breath for a minute or two but beyond that -- what happens is carbon dioxide starts to build up in your body and your brain starts to panic. It will try and get you to inhale or exhale before it starts to shut down. And Annie was trying to hold her breath for over three minutes.     And then its like okay time to take a big breath in.       Drop my hands on the side of the pool and just let myself -- fall into the water. So Im face down in the pool like arms floating by my side. Just floating there. Like a piece of Jello youre just jiggling in the water. I was like this is amazing. And I felt good through a minute and half where I was like tap for one minute. Give me a signal. I was still feeling pretty good. And I move my finger and I show him that Im okay. And then     I get my first contraction. Your body starts to demand to breathe by contracting the diaphragm. So you start getting these convulsions in your belly that feel like hiccups. Its like ugh-ugh-ugh. And its like okay okay. Keep relaxing. Stage by stage like your shins relax them. Your knees relax them. Your thighs relax them. And then  Theyre coming more and more frequently. But also theres this voice like You didnt get a good breath in youre not going to make it youre the worst at this. And so just go back to the toes and the ankles and the shins and the knees and the stomach and the arms and the shoulders and the mouth.     And then Kirk     Talks me through packing for this vacation.     And I was really doing it where I was like okay my luggage is under the bed. Im going to pull it out Im going to unzip it.     I was like okay what do I -- I dont know what to bring. Definitely going to bring that coat though. So okay I start getting my coat. I was really trying to pack this coat.     Okay my luggage. Pull it out unzipping it.       I dont know what shirt to pack. Okay.     I cant do this packing thing anymore. And then it was just like -- youre just fighting.    Youre just holding on.     Youre not going to make it. Youre the worst at this. You are a fucking idiot.     Youre so dumb. Why did you do this? Youre so bad at everything you ever tried.     And then. I was like oh Madeline. Like I saw her from above. Her head in the water. And then I was like Oh my god. This  this  its this.   So Annie grew up with two sisters. The oldest was Madeline   And she had epilepsy. And so starting at like age 10 or 12 she started having seizures sort of just randomly. You know it would happen like um at a like when something really exciting was happening. Like she would be at like um a school dance or like she would be at like the football game of the year.   And eventually she started taking medication to control the seizures.   But after you have seizures and like are like the kid who is like convulsing on the floor like you just kind of cannot get any less cool than that. So she was just like the most unabashedly herself person in the world. Like we we all shared a Toyota Camry in high school --   Oh like that was the one car for the three girls to drive?   Yeah for the three girls to drive. But she got a vanity license plate that said Mad Dog.     Wow.   And then she got a SpongeBob steering wheel cover.   But the big thing Madeline did actually all three of the girls did is swim.   I was a bad swimmer but Madeline was the swimmer. She loved to swim. And she was a butterflier.   Oh cool.   Yeah she was super strong like much stronger than me and like just got super fast and was so committed to it.   Eventually she got recruited to swim at a college in Atlanta. Did that her freshman year.   Yeah.   And how did you how did you find out what happened to her?   I was at home getting ready for this snowball dance.   Oh cus youre still in high school?   Still in high school. I was a junior. And that was the night of the big dance.   Annie was getting ready.   And my parents just kind of yelled like we are going to the hospital. Madeline is sick. And you know she had had seizures so many times and been in the hospital so many times that I was just kind of like okay like you know like here we go.   They left the house drove to the hospital.   And before we walked into the emergency room they told my mom that she was in a coma and my mom just like expl -- she just like collapsed.   Madeline had been found in the college swimming pool face down in the water.   There was not a lifeguard on duty. So like just like I um an adult swimmer who had come in to do you know his own laps just like noticed her. And we do not really know what happened. She likely had a seizure and fell in the pool.   Annie and her family basically moved into the hospital.   And it was the morn -- it was the morning of the fourth day. And I really did not want it to end. I really did not want to. I was like let us just give it another day. But the doctor was like this -- she is not she is not coming back. The rest of the day I drove home with my dad. And I just kept on repeating to myself like My sister died today. Today my sister died. And we got home. Just everything looks different. Everything looked like it had been moved around. And I sat in the living room and I was just like Madeline died today.     And so there Annie was in this pool.   This voice -- youre not gonna make it youre the worst at this -- was getting louder and louder -- fucking idiot you are going to die.   And it was after three minutes of having not taken a breath.   I was like oh Madeline. And I suddenly like was her floating there. And then I was just like I got to come up.                 Coming out I felt kind of like giddy.             And like it was like in the tape there is no like acknowledgement of the like terror. But it is it is weird. It is like I felt so like  coming. Like a very strange series of like of emotions.   After all this is over Annie said when she was thinking about Madeline coming to her in the water she kept coming back to this question.   What was the point of that? Like why did you do it and what did you learn? Um   And in some ways it was just this thing she was doing to get a job this story about controlling an impulse or an urge she realized that in her reaction to Madelines death there was also an impulse. A voice that would come to her in moments of pain and sorrow. Not totally unlike the voice she heard in the pool.   Like why was not I the one who died? You know like she was so good. Like why was not it me? She should be alive. And I should have been the one who died.   Annie says in the years since Madeline died shes learned how to push that voice away. But she did say that moment in the pool gave her another way to push it. And like uncovered a muscle she didnt totally know that she had.    If you can like learn to not trust that voice you know and like really put it down that it can get better. And hopefully it just means I can do it more. You know that like when those things come up recognizing them as this like unnecessary voice.   And getting past that voice Annie said lets you push through the grief. Or maybe just like settle into it in a way that lets you heal.   It feels like we can enjoy the memories of her more. Like you can like enjoy just who she was.
