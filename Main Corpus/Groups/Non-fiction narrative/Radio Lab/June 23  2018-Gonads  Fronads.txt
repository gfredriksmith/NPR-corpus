       This is Gonads episode two. I am Molly Webster.   Okay my dashboard says it is 12 degrees outside. It is all ...   Okay. So in January I went to Erie Pennsylvania.   Second attempt at Erie. First attempt was snowed out but on the New York side. Thank you bomb cyclone.   It was like the Arctic winters of my youth.   There are ice fisherman out on the lake.   There was like some sort of record-setting snowfall in Erie that I am sure is probably still melting up there. And I had landed in this -- in this frozen land to do a story about people freezing things.   Oh.   But not -- not things that you would expect to be frozen. I do not know what you expect out of frozenness but it is not that.   Tofutti Cuties. Ice cream. That is what I freeze.   Oh my gosh.   Blueberries.   Not fruit but actual body parts. Ooh!   Ooh. I like it.   It starts at this house. I am going to -- we are going to the house.   And here we are.      Hi!   How are you?   And the people who were at the center of the freezing were this couple.   My name is Anne Dower.   That is one half.   My name is Greg. I am Annie's husband. And ...   That is the other half.   I think that is it right?   Yeah.   Okay.   Let us start at the beginning.   So that is a crazy story. I think Shireen probably told you that right?   What is your version?   Well ...   Fall 1999.   I was teaching high school phys-ed.   It was a Friday. She had just finished coaching volleyball. And her dad called and he said Hey I am leaving work early. I am gonna go to this fish fry. I will swing by and pick you up. Let us go grab some dinner.   And I am like Sure. He goes I will be over in about 15 minutes. I said Okay. And he goes Hey it would not hurt to look a little nice and he puts the phone down and I am like Ew you know? Like because I was literally in like a Nike outfit with my sneakers because I teach gym and I just finished coaching. So like I am like -- and that is how I would have gone to dinner with them because it is dinner with my dad whatever.   But her dad had ulterior motives.   Oh there is a guy that I work with gonna meet us and I am like Ah! You set me up. So we are driving over there and I am like Dad how old is this guy? Like 50 60 years old? Like your age? Like how old is he? You know and he is like -- and he is just like Anne honestly he is not that old. He is maybe a little older than you.   So they get to the bar grab a couple of beers and then this guy walks over.   Oh that guy's not bad-looking.      This of course was Greg.   We sat down at a booth ate dinner and ...   By the end of dinner Annie's thinking ...   Yeah he is pretty cool.   We just had a lot of fun together.   And so one date leads to two two leads to three. At that point they ditch her dad because he had still been hanging out with them. And a year later things had gotten pretty serious.   We still have that placemat. In fact I was looking at it the other day.   It is in the kitchen. Get it on the ...   What -- a placemat is coming out. Describe it to our listeners.   White -- white scalloped edges. Some yellow food stains probably a little mustard.   This placemat is from a date that they went on around their one-year anniversary which was almost 20 years ago.   Texas Roadhouse right?   I think it was a Texas Roadhouse. Texas Roadhouse yeah. Or Chili's. One of the two because we used to go to Chili's.   No it was Texas Roadhouse.   Texas Roadhouse. Because they had peanuts they had great peanuts there.   And they had only been dating for a year but they were super into each other. So at a certain point they are eating their peanuts or whatever and the conversation turns to -- the future. It is like Say we are gonna be together. What do you want? Like what do you imagine?   And we just kind of were -- we were talking about all sorts of things. Like kind of a little -- almost a goal-setting that we had.   Like how much would you want to make?   You know just real casual.   Where do you want to live?   We both really like Florida. We like the climate. So we put on there I think something like we wanted to be in Florida in 2005.   And then before you know it they are -- they are jotting down ...   Children.   Kids. Like how many kids they would want to have together.   Two kids at least.   We both agreed on that.   Greg had already expressed at some point that family was super important to him.   He loved having brothers and sisters.   Annie felt the same way.   Like we went to Christmas Eve this past Christmas and I think there was 45 people there. And it was all family.   But it is like they do not write down that they just want to have kids. They start writing down ...   Like names and stuff like that you know?   Jack Dower. Jimmy. Tyler. Jake. Joseph. Joey. These were all names were throwing around. Boys' names. And then we had for girls Taylor Madeline Bobbi with an 'i' because his dad's name was Robert.   And then they wrote their own names down on it.   And he signed it and I signed it with the date.   But I just want to say guys this does not seem casual.   No! Pretty intense right? Casual dinner. We covered it all.   Your definition of casual and mine are very different.   A few months after that date they go on one of their first big trips together.   To the Super Bowl.     In Tampa Bay. And the morning of the Super Bowl we were laying in the hotel room and I woke up and I felt like ...   She had this feeling of a weight on her chest.   Like a hundred-pound weight sitting on my chest. Like I could not catch my breath. And I was like Something's wrong.   So they come back from the Super Bowl. They go to the doctor. The doctor runs a bunch of tests and then a week later they go back.   And they were like You want the good news or the bad news? And I was like The bad news. And they were like It is cancer. And I was like Okay. Not good.   It turns out she had this pretty big tumor like right down her breastplate like where your ribcage meets. Like right over your heart and lungs.   How big are we talking about?   Grapefruit-sized.   Whoa.   You know you think cancer and you immediately think you are dying or you are gonna die.   But her doctor said ...   Good news is that it is Hodgkin's lymphoma and it has a cure rate of like 95 percent.   She said that the doctor literally was like It is fine.   Called it a slam dunk.   But it is still super scary. Any cancer's scary. And at some point Annie finds herself sitting down with Greg and saying You do not have to do this.   You did not sign on for this.   Like we have not even been dating a year yet.   You know you are young. You are a good-looking guy. You can find another girl and you can be guaranteed like you know a good future and you know I said Run.   When we got diagnosed it is just like boom! Just like we got thrust from kind of this fast-track relationship and we are really having fun enjoying each other and moving -- moving pretty quick. And then bam! We got hit with that. So you got to do one of two things. You gotta say Do I -- do I love this woman and I am I ready to go on this -- kind of this tough journey that is going to be ahead? Or am I gonna get out? It was gonna have to be one or the other right? There is no gray in that scenario. So that is when I proposed to her.   Whoa! Okay.   She says yes. And so like newly-engaged they go through this cancer treatment and about nine months later after all the treatment's done she goes in for another scan and all of the cancer is totally eradicated except for this one thumbnail-sized tumor.   The grapefruit tumor I had in my chest and my spleen dissipated but it was still there.   Way smaller but it was still there right in the middle of her chest.   And at that point ...   The doctor looked scared.   I saw terror in his eyes like he was -- he was confused.   Because he was like I gave you the normal regimen. There must be something else going on. Like that should be gone.   He did not know what else to do.   So Annie and Greg thought We need a different doctor.   But Anne's insurance was not gonna cover that.   But Greg's would. So they just decide Screw it. Let us just get married right now.   And so we had like this real kind of small impromptu wedding at St. Gregory's. Just our immediate family. Brothers and sisters mom and dad. and ...   Literally that was the only people invited. It was kind of somber.   Because it was like ...   Will I be alive in a year? Like it is a big What-if?   Six days later they are in New York City with a new doctor.   Dr. Carol Portlock at Sloan-Kettering.   And they had sent all of their test results to this doctor. They have their first meeting. They go through another month of tests. And then ...   She sits down puts her glasses down.   Says ...   Okay.   I have looked over your test results and ...   You have stage-four non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. She goes It is very aggressive and it is a 70 chance you are gonna die. I just remember feeling like -- kind of like with her words and how quick they were and kind of cold it was kind of like Hmm. This might not turn out the way we both really really want it to.   Annie asked the doctor How will you treat this? Doctor says It is this super-intense chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant which is a very intense procedure. And then ...   I asked her What can I do about my fertility? And she looked at me like I had three heads you know? Like she goes My darling forget the fertility. You are fighting for your life.   And Annie says back to her like No ...   I want children.   Like I do not think you get it. We have a plan. I put this on a placemat. I signed it.   I am going to beat this. You might not believe it but I believe it.   I am having kids and I am having kids with Greg. And when I asked her why she was so adamant about it she just said it was a couple of things. One she just always really wanted to be a mom.   That is what I wanted. I wanted to be a mom but ...   Two she had just married Greg just made this promise that they could have kids together. And she felt like if she could not do that she was breaking that promise to him.   Okay so I get through it and then he is maybe not gonna want to be with me anymore? Like you know like once I get healthy because he is got dreams of himself individually. Like separate from mine you know? Even though we are married you know what I mean? Like ...   Kind of like a worry that like maybe if we cannot have kids that like we might break up?   Not really a worry but a thought. Kind of you know as you lay there and you are taking ...   Well I definitely wanted kids you know? But I was not -- however this goes I will be -- I will be happy. And so you know our focus my focus was on getting her healthy.   It was interesting because whenever they talked about like kids or when they are -- them at that time like trying to get through stuff they kept throwing their hands kind of forward where they just kept saying like -- like they were like tossing something in front of them.   Oh they would make that gesture?   They would make the gesture of like -- of like I am gonna -- I am like throwing a ball out.   Like your hand gestures are interesting because every time you talk about kids you are like shooting your hands out away from your body and like putting something out there in front of you that then you can like heave yourself towards.   I know right? I mean it is just kind of like -- Yeah like you like reel it in you know? It is out there and it is circulating so you can see it. I do not know I just felt like it was hope of there is the goal go get it.   So Portlock is like No I do not think you understand. Like we need to get you in treatment right away. Like within maybe a week. And any fertility treatment would take too long. Like egg freezing takes too long IVF that would take weeks. But Annie is just like Come on.   Anything. Give me a shot. And she just paused for about 30 seconds.   And then ...   She goes There is a doctor across the street at Weill Cornell. He is a fertility specialist. He is doing a study right now. I do not know much about it but I will make sure you have an appointment tomorrow morning.   So the next morning Annie is in the doctor's office across the street and in walks this mystery doctor.   All right the duck is in the house.   He had crazy curly black hair and he had a white lab coat on. I mean he looked like a Nutty Professor. And I am like I kind of like this guy. I do not know why I like this guy but I kind of like this guy.   Do you remember when you met her?   Yeah Anne was one of the first few patients that we did the freezing for.   Oh this is our guy from episode one. Mister Magical Gonads.   Gonads are magical organs.    Yeah.   Okay.   We are back with the magic of the gonads. We are about to re-enter the magic land and he is also the guy that brings us to freezing. But first a little context. If you think about all of human history creating more of us required an egg and a sperm and sex and then some magic happened and a baby popped out.   Yeah.   But at a certain point we started trying to figure out how to control that process. And so what starts is the freezing of reproductive parts. It all started with sperm.   Okay.   In the 1700s they realized that sperm slowed down and became really sleepy when it got cold. I do not know some sperm ended up in some snow. I am not sure what the story is but that is what they saw. It was not until the 1950s when they actually figured out how to freeze sperm thaw sperm and then use that to make a real baby. And then it is like Okay. Well if we have figured out sperm that is like half the population. So what about eggs?   And so they start trying to freeze eggs but that turns out to be a lot harder because eggs are so full of liquid. So when you try and freeze them ice crystals form and it just -- phoosh -- pierces the egg. And it is at this point sort of in the '90s that Oktay walks into the room. He was studying kind of eggs in general and fertility and he ends up in a lab that is saying you know if we cannot freeze eggs maybe what we should actually do is just freeze the ovary. Which is a totally different ballgame because an ovary is an entire organ.   Yeah. Is not an ovary kind of a big -- well how big is an ovary?   I mean it is the size of like a -- I do not know a walnut? But yeah it is not a small task. It is still a whole organ. And that is actually what is cool about this whole thing because it is the egg factory. So if you can figure out how to freeze an ovary you can potentially freeze thousands of eggs. And so when Annie shows up onto the scene this was just an idea. It had never been done before except for in animals. But the idea that a handful of doctors including Oktay had was for women in Annie's situation you know let us freeze some of your ovarian tissue and then maybe one day the technology will catch up and we can do something with it.   So when Annie walked in the door how experimental was what you were doing?   No it was highly experimental because she was one of the first few patients.   Annie comes in and he says There is this thing. It is ovarian freezing.   He goes This is brand-new.   I have never successfully done this in a human.   There were no pregnancies or anything.   He told Annie ...   What I am doing here is a shot in the dark.   This is like the basketball shot all the way across the court at the buzzer.   But unfortunately this is your only option.   And then she said she was basically like Okay.   He explained the process. Said you know this is what we will try to do you know we will ...   We can take out one of your ovaries ...   Freeze it in liquid nitrogen.   And then if you survive your cancer -- which is a big if at this point -- and if you make it to the two-year mark which is a big landmark for cancer survivors we can look at re-implanting it.   He just handed us these papers. He is like Sign away. So I must have signed my name. Like ...   Do you remember what any of the waivers were?   No. I just signed everything. Did not read it. Just signed it. Like he could have -- and we are sending it to China and we are gonna make babies with like your ovary over there. I did not like -- literally I did not like pay any attention. I just wanted a chance.   Coming up she gets that chance. And things get weird. I am Molly Webster. This is Gonads on Radiolab. Stay tuned.         It is Molly. We are back. Picking up where we left off. It is right after getting this terrible cancer diagnosis. And Annie is in the OR and Dr. Oktay takes out one of her ovaries.   Walk me through that operation. What is involved?   As far as surgeries go it is -- it is super simple.   Easy painless.   He puts her under anesthesia and then he makes an incision in her abdomen.   We go through patient's belly button with a camera and then two little punctures along the bikini line and we can pull the ovary out through that incision in the belly button.   And then they drop it in a freezer.   This is like a 45-minute outpatient procedure.   Is it the kind of thing that like once it is done you just walk home?   Yeah.   Oh yeah.   A week later she is at Memorial Sloan-Kettering getting chemo. And the treatment is like insane. She goes through rounds of chemotherapy where she gets chemo all weekend.   You know like the big zip locks like the freezer bags like the gallon? That is what they were hanging up. Filled with chemo. Non-stop. Down one? Ah time for another one. Down one? Ah time for another one. Time for another one. Constant.   In this kind of chemo they kill a lot of the cells in your body. Good cells your bad cells your immune cells your stem cells they kill everything.   You are basically dead for all intents and purposes. I mean the blood counts are all bottomed out. There is no -- there is nothing. Zero white zero red zero platelets. Your ...   From there she gets a stem cell transplant which is taking your blood out and putting stem cells back in. The idea is that then she would regrow her immune system hopefully without cancer.   May 26 I walked out of the hospital.   Annie is bald.   No eyelashes no eyebrows.   Super skinny.   Mouth sores. It sucks.   But according to the doctors ...   They were like You are good.   She is cancer-free.   You are clear. So when we got out we walked to the park.   Got a slice.   Park Pizza which is the greatest pizza ever. The sun was shining and horns honking and it was New York. Like it was like I stepped outside and I was like I am alive again. Like this is life.   But there was a pretty good chance that the cancer could come back. So she and Greg go home and wait. One month goes by two.   That placemat was just like you know hanging like on the fridge front and center. Like floating there.   Three months. Four.   I would think about the cancer most of the day. Where it was like Is it gonna come back? Where is it?   Five six. A year goes by then 18 months. Still no cancer.   When did you first have the ovary re-enter your mind?   Well it started to -- I went May 13 of '04 you know the two-year mark. And they did a PET scan bloodwork all that and I was clear. And that day I went and saw Oktay.   You just walked across the street.   I did! I was like I told him I was gonna be there.   And what you will remember is the last time she talked to Oktay the deal was get to the two-year mark. If you get to the two-year mark give me a call. I have no idea where we will be at with this technology then. No idea if I am gonna be able to give you a baby but we will see. Now in that interim period in those two years Oktay had been continuing to experiment working with other patients taking thawed tissue and putting it back in them. But not where you would expect.   Yeah my -- originally we did this in the forearm.   What? Like right under my watch? Like on my forearm?   Yes correct. We would take it and stick it in the muscle in the forearm.   An ovary in the forearm?   Yeah.   How does that even make sense?   Well it makes sense because this is how crazy weird like an ovary is. You can put it literally anywhere in the body that has good blood supply ...   And in the next three to ten days new blood vessels form. And then ...   So it just -- it just pops on?   Correct.   But then how do you get a baby out of an ovary that is in your forearm?   Oh so the idea is that you could just you know sort of pluck the mature eggs out from just underneath the skin and then you could combine them with the sperm in a Petri dish and just do normal IVF where you would make an embryo in a Petri dish and then implant it.   Gotcha.   But by the time Annie walked in no one had done this and gotten it to work. There had yet to be a baby born from an ovarian transplant. When Annie showed up though Oktay was ready.   He said I am gonna take the 21-inch strips ...   These little bits of her ovary that had been frozen for two years.   And we are gonna suture them right underneath your belly button in your stomach.   Wow! Wait why there?   Well he has -- he put -- prior to me he had put a few in a woman's rear end.   No really?   It actually was not him that did that but rumor on the street is that there is an ovary in a butt somewhere.   But he felt that putting it closest to where the other ovary is and where its original spot was was probably the most beneficial. And he goes Hopefully within two months you will get a menstruation cycle. And he goes And then you will come out of menopause.   Because remember that chemo would have shut down that remaining ovary and put her into full-on menopause.   We do not know. It is not a guarantee. We just gotta see.   So Oktay does the procedure. Again it is super simple. He implants a few bits of ovary in the skin next to her belly button.   And ...   Two months later ...   Started to feel the first little marbles.   Down around her belly button she had these lumps.   I do not know how to describe it. But like under the skin you can actually like kind of grab it.   And Annie would always say Put your -- put your finger right here 'ecause you can feel them. And you know certain times of the month they would -- it would get bigger.   Huge eggs on the skin. It was really weird. I mean I would have all different sizes. Like sometimes less than dimes sometimes as big as a quarter.   What did it feel like?   It just feels like if you rubbed your finger across -- almost like just a bigger version of kind of like you know they have you know like the Braille on the elevators.   We would go to New York and Oktay would actually measure them.   It was interesting.   With like a measuring tape and like put like marks on. And he would like measure their circumference. And he would be like Great! That is a good size!   And Annie says they hurt.   I mean I could not buckle my jeans because the buckle -- like the button on the jeans would hurt pressing against the skin because they were sticking out you know?   Did you move to elastic pants?   Oh yeah. It was like real pretty you know?   So about a month after the marbles show up they fly down to New York City for a series of appointments. First a cancer checkup they get a PET scan. Next day they go see Oktay.   And that is when all these interesting things beginning to happen.   Annie's on the exam table.   He starts to do an ultrasound which is always so uncomfortable.   And then all of a sudden ...   Oktay says Oh my God! Oh my God!   And I think I almost passed out.   And I am like Is everything okay? He is like This cannot be.   This cannot happen.   And I am looking at him and I am like Dr. Oktay what is wrong? He is like Hold on. He kept looking he is looking at the monitor and doing all this stuff. I said What cannot be? He goes You are pregnant.   What?   Yeah!   It was just an unbelievable moment.   I was like I am pregnant? No.   You know am I looking at the right patient? You know like take a look at the charts again.   Wait she is pregnant. What does that mean?   I mean no one really knows what it means. It means that there are eggs that are protruding out of her skin and yet somehow there is also an embryo in her uterus.   I said How? He goes The old-fashioned way sweetheart.    But Annie was like No no. Really. How?   You know what -- I do not understand. He is like I do not know.   And then he is like Wait.   I am trying to find a heartbeat.   It turns out ...   There was no heartbeat.      It is not viable.   Oh fuck!   And it -- it goes on from there. They get into the car. Phone rings.   It is Dr. Moscowitz from Sloan. I am like Shit. Like why is he calling us? The shoe's gonna drop. The cancer's back right? Because we just had the PET scan like literally the day before.   So she picks up the phone.   I am like Everything okay? He is like Your scans are fine. You are clear. I said Huh okay. I thought you were calling ... He goes I know what you thought. He goes You thought I was calling to tell you that the cancer is back and to get back to the hospital. And I was like Yeah. And he is like No. You are cancer-free. He goes Did you know you are pregnant? And I am like Just found out. He is like You went to Oktay? And I said Yep. And he goes Did you know you were pregnant before you had the PET scan? And I said No. I said Could the PET scan have killed it? He said Yes.   So that was kind of hard.   Kinda!   You know because it was like Shit!   Wow that is crazy whiplash.   Yeah.   Wait can I just -- let me just catch up here. How did this -- like she is got marbles in her belly button.   Marbles in her belly button.   And now you are saying that suddenly a baby appeared in her uterus? That is a long way away from her belly button.   I do not get it.   I do not get it. Like so what did the belly button -- how does -- is it -- what happened?   That ...   That is the question.   There are so many different possible answers.   Definitely something happened there. And what was that something? Divine intervention? I do not know.   So Oktay eventually does publish two papers on this. And he raises like a lot of different ways this -- this could happen. In Annie's -- here's maybe the thing to remember for all these explanations.   Yes.   So in -- so if you think about Annie's body right now there is the one ovary that was left inside that is now defunct.   It is dead.   Right? Everyone describes as like a dead ovary.   Because it is been killed by the chemo.   Right. So you have got the dead ovary inside her. You have got the transplant below her belly button in the skin which is very much alive full of eggs.   Little marbles.   So to get a pregnancy here's what might have happened. A couple different options. First maybe one of these immature sort of egg cells near her belly button slips out of the transplanted ovarian tissue gets into the bloodstream is transported through the bloodstream all around the body.   Into the opposite ovary.   The dead one. Where it is like Oh this is the place I want to be.   Oh my God.   It settles. And then in there is matured and then can be sucked up by the Fallopian tube and made into a baby.   Correct. So biologically speaking it is plausible. Let us remember germ cells got to the ovary through a long migration.   Remember last episode?   The Great Migration.   The Great Migration.   Yeah.   But this would be the Great Migration times a million because it is going all around the body.   Yeah. The most likely and most reasonable thing that -- that probably happened is that the ovarian transplant in reconnecting with the body sends out its signals like Hey hey! Hey hey! We have got some hormones going on here.   And these hormones help the other ovary wake up.   Turn back on. And then if it had any remaining egg cells that were like dormant maybe you could like rejuvenate them or get them to mature and then those could become a baby.   Wow. So either these eggs are going on a journey like no other or they are waking the dead.   Yeah just two very reasonable options.   That is bananas both ways.   Yeah.   That is like double bananas.   It is so bananas that when it happened Oktay just thought it was ...   Luck.   Like maybe that ovary inside her the dead one just had like one last egg. But a month and a half later?   Pregnant.   Again.   In the same way?   Yeah.   In her uterus?   Yeah.   Like holy crap! My body healed enough I could actually achieve a pregnancy without intervention.   And so September 25th 2005. Sienna Anne Dower was born.     The first baby ever born in the US of an ovarian transplant.           Greg Annie Oktay ...     Little baby Sienna. Hit the road on a media blitz.     So that happens. And then three years later ...    Pregnant.   It happened again.   With little Greg.   Same thing? The old-fashioned way?   Yes. And at this point they are like We are good.   We had a girl a boy. They were healthy. No issues thank God.   They felt like We have executed the dream of the placemat.   No intention of having another one. Like zero.   But four months later ...   Pregnant.   Again!   Three babies back-to-back-to-back. I mean how do you become super-fertile after being in clinical menopause for two years?   Does he still think that Annie and Greg got lucky? That this was kind of a one-off?   No because since Sienna was born we have had many more babies born from this procedure.   As we stand now there are perhaps over a hundred babies born all around the world.   And it is no longer like just happening within the fertility community. I bumped into doctors that are experimenting using it with women who are going into menopause. An ovarian patch that will inject hormones to delay menopause. The other place where I bumped into it is in the trans community where kids who are transitioning from female to male are opting to -- or their parents are choosing to freeze their ovary so they have a chance of possibly having biological kids if they want to do that.   So it is -- it is cool because you -- you have this feeling of like when I was standing in the room with Annie I kept having this like feeling of -- you just feel like really close to some sort of power. Like maybe because it is an -- which is kind of ridiculous because I have this power too right? I have ovaries. But them being outside the body and like -- like she said kind of like sci-fi experiment. It is just like humans are marching towards this moment of just like regulating every part of the human process. But then almost as quickly as you have that thought you realize it is 13 years later. You have these kids running around. And Oktay still does not really understand what happened.   So this is Molly.   Hi!   This is Sienna.   I am Molly.   I do not know if anyone does.   How are you?   Good.   What are you working on?   My science fair project.   What is this?   I did not even know you had this Mom.   They are just now getting to the age to where we talk -- you know talk to them about it. And we showed Sienna some of the tapes and we showed her some of the footage from being on the Today Show.   I seen this picture before though. Because if you search up my name on Google -- I searched up my name and this picture came up and a bunch of other ones of me as a baby. So ...   Wait.
