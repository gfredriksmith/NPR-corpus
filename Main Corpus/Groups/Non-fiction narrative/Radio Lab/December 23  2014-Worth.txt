     Are you ready?   Yes.   Feeling -- feeling ...   I am feeling ...   Full of worth?   I am feeling full of value.   Well in that spirit I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today ...   Three very different stories that try to put a dollar value.   Mugen is okay. 1000000.   7.   10000.   Yeah I would say five bucks.   On things ...   That seem ...   Priceless.   Priceless.   Priceless.   Priceless.   Is it really?   Okay so start at the top. So ...   Bring on the pressure.   All right we are gonna start the show with a story from our producer Molly Webster.   I do not remember any of it.   Who we might actually want to rename Molly Wonkster because she recently got herself into some serious numericizing. Actually it did not start as a wonky thing. It started actually with some medical journals.   Yeah that was -- so that was interesting because it was some of the most poetic writing I have seen out of doctors ever. One journal article said like What would one more month mean to a 37-year-old mother who has four children? Or what would one more month mean if you are a 67-year-old who is about to go traveling around the world. People were just kind of like drifting these questions out there where they were ...   All these questions seemed to circle around a seemingly simple story of the pricing of a drug. A cancer drug.   And the story if you really want to tell it from the beginning it begins with this guy named Leonard.   Leonard Saltz I am a medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.   Which is here in New York and it is one of the largest cancer centers in the country.   We have 17 doctors here who treat colon cancer.   Just for colon cancer?   We treat a very large number of patients.   It is a huge hospital. And one of the things Leonard's been noticing in the last I do not know decade is cancer drug prices have just gone through the roof.   I mean we have drugs out there that are many hundreds of dollars per pill.   Really?   Yeah. Oh just wait. Let us see where does this start? It starts -- it is June in 2012.   Mm-hmm.   Leonard Saltz is at a conference and at this conference is a pharmaceutical company called Sanofi. And they give a presentation about a new drug that they have.   A drug called Zaltrap. And Zaltrap is a drug that without getting into the science too much targets the blood supply to the tumor.   It cuts off the blood supply which means the tumor cannot grow.   That is -- that is the scientific hypothesis.   So this new drug is presented and they like present the data.   And they showed that the survival difference ...   Between the people who got Zaltrap and the people who did not.   Was 1.4 months or 42 days.   In other words if you take this drug you could get 42 more days of life on average which means you could get three more days you could get no days you could get 42 or you could live another three years.   42.   42 days.   Down to the -- down to the fine grain.   Yeah. Oh please. I could show you some graphs that have been put up at meetings that show survival curves calculated out to two decimal places in terms of months. So I am looking at ...   So that is like not a tenth of a month ...   A hundredth of a month. A hundredth of a month. That is a little over seven hours.   What?   Pretty amusing actually.   Wait. Why would you -- why would you ...?   It is pseudo-precision.   Pseudo-precision.   At any rate ...   Anyways after the conference the FDA approves the drug. And basically once the FDA approves a drug public insurance has to take it and then the private insurance companies just follow suit which means you get prescribed the drug and people pay for it.   And what does the drug cost?   That is the thing.   It costs ...   Roughly ...   30000 for a three-month course.   Wow!   So ...   So Leonard's like Wow that is expensive. And there was already another drug on the market did the same thing and it cost half as much. To put that in context this is just one drug that is 11000 a month. A normal cancer patient might take dozens of drugs.   There are anti-nausea medicines that are sometimes used that are in the range of 90-100 a tablet and you take a tablet once a day for three days. One needs growth factors to help support the white blood cell count which you sometimes need in chemo. Those can be 5000 every two to three weeks. If you need antibiotics to treat infections those are not cheap. And then you need a pharmacist to prepare it. They are labor-intensive. You need tubing and equipment and needles to give it. You need trained nurses to administer it. You need doctors to take care of the patients. And do not forget there is a cost for a CAT scan or MRI. And -- and then of course someone's got to pay for the real estate the heat and the lights. None of those prices are figured into it okay? I am just giving you the cost of the drug.   So Leonard calls up one of his colleagues.   My name is Peter Bach. I am a physician at Memorial Sloan-Kettering.   Peter is the number-cruncher of the group. He does the statistical analysis of I do not know the cost of care and Len grabbed him and ran him through all the data.   And we walked through the out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare beneficiaries if they do not have additional insurance 20 cents of every dollar they pay out of pocket.   And that number sort of hit him because he realized for Medicare patients they would be paying something like 2000 out of pocket every month for just this drug.   It was 2200 if I remember the number correctly.   For a lot of Medicare patients ...   That is all of their money. Never mind other drugs That is when I thought we should go public with it.   Memorial Sloan-Kettering they decide to boycott this drug.   Now that ...   Is that -- I mean I am just stopping you because when you guys made that decision was that -- that feels like a big deal.   It did feel like a big deal. And it felt like a big enough deal that we decided to write the op-ed piece in the New York Times.   They write an op-ed in the Times that basically says Look this is crazy. 11000 a month for a drug that maybe gives you 42 more days of life?   Is that worth it? And a little less than a month after the op-ed piece came out ...   The company that makes Zaltrap ...   They went to individual doctor's offices sent representatives and said We are offering a 50 percent discount.   They cut the price in half just like that?   Yep.   Nationwide? Or like just in this area?   Nationwide.   It was sort of incredible.   We reached out to Sanofi to talk about the price of Zaltrap and they declined to comment. But in a statement that they released when this whole Zaltrap thing happened they said that they incur so many costs for researching and developing and bringing a drug to market that that is what their pricing is based on. Leonard does not disagree.   We need these companies. They are the ones developing the drugs.   Which are not easy to develop. I mean Leonard gave us just one example.   If we talk about colon cancer ...   He says for years there was only one drug on the market called 5FU.   5FU was patented in August of 1957. It was from 1957 until 1996 that a second drug came along.   That is how long it takes to develop a good drug? Or ...   In that interim there were over 70 drugs that were tried and failed.   I feel like I do not give it enough credit because that just astounded me.   It is very very hard.   And that according to Leonard is one of the reasons why prices are just gonna keep going up.   But sooner or later this system is going to fall apart. And at what point does society say Hmm there is not an infinite number of dollars that we can commit to our healthcare system.   It is funny because I had this interesting reaction to the word society because all of a sudden I thought like why is -- not in like a you know crazy death panel way but I thought why -- why is society involved in my conversation with my doctor about if I want to take this drug that may give me another month and a half of life?   Why is society involved? Because you are not paying unless you have hidden resources I am aware of probably could not afford 10000 to 15000 a month in drug bills. Someone else has to pay that.   Obviously he says it is your insurance. I mean say you are part of a policy that has 1000 members.   Let us say that the premium for that is 100. So we had 100 thousand people. We got ourselves 100000 okay? So we now have 100000 to take care of that thousand people.   For that month.   For whatever amount of time. If now one person comes up with a healthcare cost -- let us say it is for a month -- that is 100000 in that month everybody else is in trouble. There is no money left.   So they write this op-ed saying like prices are too high and the drugs are not that great. And sort of the next like notable wave is there was this -- there is this journal called Blood which is really big to anybody that works in a community that has like ...   It is a journal called Blood?   Yeah.   How did we not know about this when we made The Blood Show?   Oh I knew. Just kept it in here.    Anyhow.   So yes there is a journal called Blood which is basically like the -- the journal for anybody that works in a field that has to do with blood. And what happens is like a hundred doctors get together and they co-sign an editorial which basically says We totally agree with everything you guys are saying but we have an even bigger issue. You know with Zaltrap you are talking about an expensive drug that maybe does not really do that much. It is kind of easy even though it had never been done before to say We are not gonna use this. What all of these doctors in the Blood editorial are saying What do you do when you have a really expensive drug but it is really really good? It is like a drug you actually want to take.   Is that like a -- like a one day in the future we will face this kind of question?   No. That is like a now today question.     Everyone I talked to pointed me to this new drug.             Sovaldi came on the market last December.   So that is December 2013.   That is correct.   This is Bruce.   Bruce Mohl. I am the editor of Commonwealth Magazine.   He is written about Sovaldi and here's the basic story right? It is a drug that treats ...   Hepatitis C.   Which is caused by a virus.   And the disease itself goes to work on your liver. It inflames it. It scars it.   It can cause liver cancer cirrhosis. It can be fatal. And for the longest time the treatments that they had just really were not that great or they just had wretched side effects. But along comes Sovaldi and it is one pill 12 weeks. You take it with some other antiviral meds. It is a super simple treatment option.   And the side effects are very minimal.   Like this -- it was like kind of like the savior drug. And so a lot of doctors start to prescribe it.   In the first half of 2014 70000 people in the country in the United States were treated. And it had a 95 percent rate of cure. In other words ...   Holy cow. That is big!   ... the virus was eradicated. That is very big.   But in fitting with our story ...   This drug costs 1000 a pill.   Whoa! For like one -- one pill that I take ...   One a day.     Which as you can imagine it angered a lot of people with hep C. In total it costs 84000. And if you think about the fact that in 2014 we know at least 70000 people got this drug ...   Then you are starting to talk about serious money.   Wait I want to -- I just want to say that I -- I just times-ed out 70000 times 84000 and I got something with seven zeros in it. It is 588 and then there is seven zeros which is like 5-billion?   Yes. Yeah.     And so we have a situation where states are basically having to ration.   Yeah.   Say in Massachusetts ...   Most of the insurers currently are requiring some liver damage before you can take the drug.   Similar restrictions are happening in other states. Florida. It is happening in Oregon. Illinois.     And then there is Arizona. Out of the entire state public insurance only approves 180 people for treatment.   Just 180?   Just 180. Now when I talked to a representative of the company that makes the drug ...   Gregg Alton. Executive Vice President for Corporate and Medical Affairs for Gilead Sciences.   He says you got to keep in mind this is not a chronic care situation. This is a ...   Cure. Here you are actually curing a person of a disease. We are talking about 12 weeks of therapy period. That is it. And you are done and you have cured somebody.   So he says this is a one-time deal. This is like one time 84000 and then you are done. Think about all the years you will live without having an illness. Then you will see ...   Over a 20-year period the savings that will accrue to the system by having a patient cured of hepatitis C.   He also said it is important to understand that every hepatitis C sufferer is not going to hit the system at the same time. So all of the cost is spread out right? Which is totally true but I think there is like this bigger picture here and Bruce points it out too.   It is sort of like a precursor of what could come because these companies are developing drugs all the time. What if -- if you could get a drug but it was very expensive to treat diabetes?   And then you are talking tens of millions of people.   An enormous segment of the population.   Even if just a fraction of them want a drug that is 1000 per day that is practically our entire U.S. budget.   What do you do in that case? A drug comes along like that and throws everything out of whack.   This is the part where I really sort of got hooked in where it is like how do you answer this question? Is it that you know at a certain point you just draw a line and you say Beyond this point we are not paying.   But beyond what point?   Exactly. I mean that is the hard part. Like how good does a treatment have to be for you to say this is worth the price that it is been set at?   I do not think we reject it out of hand but I do not think ...   I got into this a bit with Leonard. In the case of Zaltrap they said All right. 42 days that much money. We are not gonna do it. But would it have been different if it was 50 days or a hundred? Is that enough?   I am sure you want to be talking in years but I guess the question is like what would be a -- is there a magic line for you?   If I -- this is a -- I cannot personally determine it for everybody. I would not presume to try. But ultimately as a society we are going to have to reach an understanding of what that cut point is because we cannot afford not to.   And the question that sort of bubbles out of this conversation is what is one more year or one more month or one more day of life worth to us?   Are we willing to pay 1000 for an extra day of life? Well what about 100000 for an extra day of life?   You know people like to say Yeah so what is the value of a human life? And the answer is boy that is a complicated question but a really important one. Because nobody thinks it is infinite.   He said that and I was like okay it is not zero and it is not infinite. Is there an answer like in the middle? And so I started looking around. I do not know. I guess I was wondering has anyone actually thought about this? And so I started looking around and what I realized was that the World Health Organization actually -- I mean I guess they almost have a number but it is a number per country. They have the recommendation that -- that countries spend it is gonna get gobbly-gooky but just bear with me.   Yeah.   That countries spend one to three times the GDP per capita which is like the gross domestic product per individual.   So take the entire fat ball of money that is in a country and divide it per individual?   Divide it by the individuals and then you spend one to three times that on one more good year of life.   And what would that be for us?   So for the U.S. that is about 50000 to 150000.   Interesting. And does that -- does that have any teeth? That recommendation?   It legally does not have any teeth but it has teeth in the sense that doctors in the U.S. are actually gonna start using this WHO number to evaluate medical treatments for cardiology. They said they were gonna do this in a paper and it was kind of very quiet very subtle. But in other countries this conversation is very loud actually. It happens at the government level. They are also passing out surveys where they are asking citizens what is your limit on how much you want to spend on one more good year of life?   Have they done that here ever?   As far as I know no.   Why not?   Because -- because the last time we tried to talk about cost in medicine it ended up in the whole ...         ... thing. And I do not know I just wondered ...   All right into the mess of it. Hey Times Square.   If I actually tried to go out and ask this question in a very basic way how would people respond?   Excuse me can I ask you a question? What is a year of life worth?   Wow what a question.   That is deep. Can I think about it?   That is a tough one but ...   I was really surprised at how seriously people took the question.   Man what is a year of life worth?   That was the first thing I noticed. Then the next thing was no one could answer the question until I had answered like a million questions of theirs.   Am I gonna die tomorrow?   Yes.   Where do I get that year? Do I get it at the beginning the middle or the end?   How would I spend that year of life?   Good. It would be a good year of life.   A good year of life depends ...   Is this like a pie-in-the-sky kind of answer?   They wanted to know would they be emotionally happy? Alone? With friends or family? Where did they get the money? Could they borrow the money? Did they have to pay the money back? Were they dying? Was it an emergency? Were other people also trying to get money at the same time because then there would be like a rush on the money in America.   Oh interesting. Did you actually ever end up getting numbers?   I did get numbers but they were ...   At least ...   10000.   15000.   13.   Quarter million?   7.   All over the place.   Yeah I would say five bucks.   10-million.   Oh 44000.   Interesting. One woman said 10-million.   10-million for a year? It is irresponsible.   Well you are asking me about my personal choice?   10-million?   Not about a public policy question.   Well do you have any way of parsing all this?   No I really -- I honestly do not. Like I think my biggest takeaway was like no one punched me which -- which makes me feel as if people are ready -- not ready but willing to engage in this conversation. But I also realized I kept talking about things and I just wanted to be in the room with patients. Like I just wanted patients in the room with me because it was like we were all having this conversation that eventually we will all be patients I guess but we were also having this conversation around like a group of people that were not ever present. Like they are not at conferences or not in research articles. And so that was when I started talking to patients.   Ah well.   I guess what is 42 days? What does 42 days mean in the sense of is that something that you would pay 50000 for if you were -- I mean of course you would. That -- it is like ...   Now I think ...   I almost cannot even ask the question but I do not know.   Well I -- no I think it is a good question. I think ethically it would be to the good of patients and doctors to have this conversation.   This is Susan.   Susan Gubar writer of the Living With Cancer blog for the New York Times.   Back in 2008 Susan went to the doctor. She had not been feeling well for a while. They thought it was some sort of bowel issue but then the doctor walked into the room and said she had ...   Advanced stage ovarian cancer. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at a late stage and it is -- it is basically incurable. It can be handled it can be managed it can be kept at bay and for longer periods of time now we hope. But you are given a diagnosis of three to five years.   Wow. That is -- you go from having unlimited time in your mind to three to five years in like a doctor's visit.   Yeah. It is -- it is a big shock. You sort of enter a zone where you are not quite aware of what you are doing.   That day the day she was diagnosed she was told pack a bag get in a car and drive to Indianapolis. You need surgery now.   So I went the next day to Indianapolis. And the day after that I had the debulking surgery which takes out the ovaries and the uterus and the Fallopian tubes and the spleen and sometimes the cervix and sometimes the appendix. And ...   Holy shit!   Sometimes the bowel.   Are you serious?   Yeah it is called the mother of all surgeries.   And then just like that she was doing multiple rounds of chemo.   Chemicals that are used they destroy all quick growing cells. So for example you have no hair no eyebrows no eyelashes. That you know. You also can -- I got terrible sores in my mouth. I have no idea why but I know this happens to other people. But yeah the other thing is this extreme fatigue.   And Susan who writes for a living could not even read.   I would look at a page and think Had I turned a page? Chemotherapy it really is toxic to the spirit to the heart to the mind. Just the normal aspects of life feel polluted.   Have you ever had to think about cost?   I was never informed of the cost of any drug or any procedure I was given. Which really makes me think about how masked these costs are.   Would you want to be thinking about cost while you are going through it? Or is it better to just say Here are your treatment options. These are statistical outcomes. Like pick one and then we will deal with it on the other side.   I think there is a kind of unspoken agreement among everyone that the insurance company or Medicare is gonna pay. And if it is the government that means that our grandchildren are gonna end up paying for all of this money. So yes I guess to answer your question I think it would be healthier to know what these things cost. On the other hand I have to say as a patient I was so traumatized I am not sure I could have taken that information in. I was thinking about your -- what it is worth? What is it worth title. And I was thinking that the American individualistic optimistic response would be well whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. Life is worth it. Whatever it takes. But whatever it takes will not cure my cancer. So I think this question changes when you have incurable cancer. It becomes a different question which is when is enough enough?   I remember when she said that. When is enough enough? I was just ...   I do not know that we are ready to say there is one magic line.   ... thrown back to this conversation that I would had with Leonard Saltz where he was saying that ...   We have to look at everything in terms of value.   You need to think deeply about the kind of life you want to live. It is not just about how many days it is about what kind of day.   So if you told me that there was something that gave a 72-day survival benefit but it makes people feel nauseous for most of the time is that worth it?   When we are trying to draw this line as a society before we figure out what we are willing to pay we have to think about what we are paying for.   Yeah I do not think we know what ...   For Susan you know six years ago she decided that she was gonna get chemotherapy because in part it would be more time with her daughters.   Yeah.   And suddenly it is worth it.   Yeah but I think we are changed by the treatment too.   For now Susan's cancer is basically under control because she is on this new drug.   For two -- two years and now a month and I am counting.   Okay.   I have been alive without a recurrence without the cancer growing by taking these pills every day. And I take them at home. They are not infused in the hospital through my veins. They are just pills. And it is made the last few years remarkably normal-like. The new normal.   Yeah.   But when these drugs stop working and I have been told they will stop working I am not sure I would want to go back to chemotherapy. But I suspect I do not know until I get there.   Producer Molly Webster.   And now for the thank-yous for that piece. We want to thank Stephen Hall and just want to mention Susan Gubar's book called Memoir of A Debulked Woman.   And thanks also to Dr. Atul Gawande for all his help and his latest book.   Which is really -- I really thought it was wonderful. It is called Being Mortal.   Yeah. And thanks also to Nikki Haines.   And to Glenn Blumquist.   Radiolab will continue in a moment.                       Three two one. Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today ...   Well we are still on the subject of worth but this is a totally different take.   Yeah and this is comes from our producer Matt Kielty.   So next a slightly different story about worth. A story that rather than being about how much we value our own lives is about how much we value someone else's.   Right.   And it starts with BuzzFeed writer Gregory Johnsen.   So okay maybe you should start with what has now become sort of the infamous wedding -- wedding drone strike. Is that ...   Right.   Was that sort of where it started for you?   Yeah. So this strike happens in a very rugged part of Yemen where there are no paved roads no electricity. There is no running water.   It is Thursday morning.   December 12 2013. And ...   Early that morning in a small village ...   .. a group of guys roughly 50 to 60 people.   Including a soon-to-be-married man pile into a bunch of cars and they started driving.   This is the convoy. The wedding convoy.   Now in the lead car of this convoy was this man.     His name is Abdullah Mohammed al-Tisi. We spoke to him through an interpreter in Yemen. And Abdullah told me it was his neighbor who was the groom to be married that day. And so they were all driving up to the bride's village. Abdullah said they got there a little before noon ate lunch recited wedding poems.   After lunch ...   They grabbed the bride ...   And just a few of her bridal attendants a few females.   And they start driving back to the groom's village for the actual wedding ceremony. Now Abdullah said that ever since they would left that morning through lunch all day long they heard this humming.   This sort of metallic whirring this metallic thumping overhead.   No one in the convoy could see it but they knew what it was. A drone.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' Some sound we would been hearing all day.   It is nothing new for people in rural parts of Yemen. By this point they do not think anything of it.   It is common to hear those sounds.   Yeah it is usually heard there.   So they keep driving.   Basically if you can imagine it they are sort of winding through these wadis these desert mountainous places.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' The road he said is mountainous.   They are all strung out on this rutted-out little dirt track.   11 cars single-file.   Finally they reach this little clearing.   Up near the top of this cliff where they all slowed down and started to bunch together because apparently one of the cars had gotten a flat. Some guys got out fixed it got back in their cars. And right at that moment ...   The sound shifts somehow and then the missiles start.   Four of them ...   In quick succession. The shrapnel is just flying everywhere.   In a blink it is over.   People are trying to figure out what has happened. All the screaming. There is fires that are burning.   And Abdullah his car was torn up. He had shrapnel in his face.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' Two ones in his face. One in the right hand left thigh. One on -- in the back.   And he says that once he saw there was smoke his first thought was Where is my son?  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' He was -- he was looking for his son.   His son was there?   Yeah. A young man who would been a few cars back from them.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' The fourth car on the convey. And he was married with two boys and one daughter.   Abdullah said he could move so he got out of his car and stumbled back toward the fourth car to find his son.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' Yeah he said he found him just next to the car. Before just he died. No he did not talk to him. Just he looked at him and just passed away.   So it turns out that there are 12 dead. And typically what happens in Yemen is that as soon as someone is killed they are buried very very shortly thereafter. What happens here is something different. The people in the convoy take the bodies of the dead and they take them back to Radaa.   This big town near where the drone strike occurred.   There is a video I have ...   That is what you are hearing. Where you see some men take these 12 dead bodies ...   And they line them up in the street on this bright blue tarp and they sort of wrap them in these cheap blankets. And so there is this huge crowd that just gathers around to stare at these dead bodies who are laid out in the street.   And at a certain point ...   This very tiny very leathery old Yemeni who is sort of holding onto the back of a pickup with one arm.   He stands over the dead.   Sort of swaying over the bodies and just lecturing the crowd on what happened. He is just screaming at them. And so you can hear his voice start to go hoarse. And he is screaming An American drone killed these. It was a massacre. These people are on their way to a wedding. Why did this happen? Why were they killed?   Why did they target this -- this convoy?   Well according to the US government they had received intel that on that day in this convoy was an Al-Qaeda operative ...   Named Shawqi al-Badani.   Who apparently had been planning attacks against the US.   That is why they took the shot. And in fact they say that he was wounded in this -- in this wedding convoy strike.   And do we have any reason to believe that?   I have no reason to believe it.   Greg spent weeks in Yemen talked to survivors of the drone strike.   Talked to people who were there. No one knows this guy.   Greg says the guy is not really a member of either of the tribes that were involved in the wedding. And so to him ...   It makes no sense that he would be there.   To him this was a terrible mistake. But what really got me interested in Greg's reporting which you can read on Buzzfeed.com highly recommend it is that he goes really deep into the question of like what the U.S. did next. Because the question is like what do you do in this case? How do you repair something like this? When you have two totally different cultures with two different traditions how do you find a way to try to make this right?   I do not think you can can you?   No.   I mean historically do soldiers have an obligation to repair the damage they do?   No there is no obligation. But what is happened is we have actually created an obligation for ourselves.   Hmm. Americans have?   Yeah. Yeah. This has a really long history. A history that is ...   You mean a legal -- legally?   Yeah yeah yeah. A legal history.   Really?   And there is a -- there is a great law professor at Yale.   What is His name?   His last name is Witt. It is John Witt.   That is me.   We ended up tracking down John Witt.   Hi Jad. How are you?   To talk about how the US first started to try to right the wrongs in war.   So what is the foundation story of all this?   That starts with General Pershing and World War I.   So 1917 ...     The Great War ramps up. So we start shipping young men ...     Over to Europe specifically France. And in charge of these men was a man named John J. ...     Commander of American forces on the Western Front.   Stern man handsome mustache. Bit of a maverick.   General Pershing's nickname was Blackjack. And ...   When he first arrives in France with his troops General Blackjack Pershing ...   He is got this problem which is that he has Jeeps.     So World War I is the first war in which the U.S. is shipping a lot of automobiles.   More than 100000.   For the soldiers to drive. Cars trucks Jeeps.   And Jeeps are really great. They get his men from one place to another.   From Paris to Orlans to I do not know Marseilles.   But they also run into French farmers' chickens and cows. Children. Sometimes just the farmers themselves.   Were these random collisions or were there no roads?   I am gonna bet there was some of everything. Sometimes it was probably just ordinary car accidents and sometimes no doubt a little French wine was involved.   So this is Pershing's problem. He is trying to run a war overseas ...   And it was not any good for him to have grumpy civilians at his rear.   And so Pershing has an idea which he actually borrows from the Brits. And that is he will use ...   Cash.   Money to right our wrongs.   And so he goes to Congress and begs for a statute and Congress obliges really quickly. There is no sign this is a controversial thing.   But it was a genuinely new thing because for the first time in the history of war as far as we could tell you had a state compensating individuals. Usually it is state to state here you have state to individuals. And so the U.S. government starts systematically paying money for the loss of a non-American life in war.   How much?   Jeez I do not know.   It is actually surprisingly hard to find documentation mentioning specific amounts. But whatever the amounts were it seems to have worked. Pershing wrote in his biography that these swift and prompt settlement of claims had a great effect upon the people. So it seemed to work really well.   And is this -- I mean is the idea here that like this is what we would do with the drone strike victims we talked about? That we would pay them money?   Well it is actually -- it is a bit trickier than that because the thing that Pershing got in World War I it came with a catch.   And that is that there is a combat exclusion.   In case you just walked in that is Gregory Johnsen. And what he means is that this law basically what it said is that we will pay your claims if it did not happen on the field of battle and it was not a combat situation. If it was combat and it was on the field of battle then tough luck. That is just war.   So if U.S. soldiers were driving to a fight and they ran their car into somebody and they damage that car killed that person those people would not be able to get compensation. Whereas if the U.S. soldiers were driving to a bar and got in an accident they would be able to get compensation.   But the problem is once we get into these counterinsurgency wars.   Civilians are suddenly in the middle of the fray.     This is in a way the story of modern warfare.       By the time we get to Afghanistan and Iraq the fighting is happening in cities. So there is no difference really between the battlefield and where people live. And so the line between what is combat-related and what is not combat-related it starts to get blurry.   And so in 2003 in Iraq what happened was there were actually people lining up. You know there were civilian military operation centers people started lining up outside of these saying My family has been harmed. I want help.   How many people? Do you remember?   If I had to guess it was you know maybe around 80 people or so.   That is a ton of people.   Yeah.   That is John Tracy. He was a military lawyer in Iraq in 2003 and before him Marla Keenan.   I am Managing Director of Center for Civilians in Conflict.   So when they came with a complaint what sort? Is it like You ran over my chicken or you knocked out my window?   No. No no no. much more serious.   I mean I think of cluster bombs. During the Shock and Awe campaign one of the types of bombs that we were using or the Air Force was using were what they call cluster munitions.   Basically John says Air Force planes would fly over these targets and drop hundreds and hundreds of these tiny little ...   ... bombs. Smaller than a Coke can.   And a lot of them would land in maybe a parking lot or a field. And they would not explode.   So on a number of occasions you would have -- mostly it was kids right? Because the kids would see it and ...   They did not know any better.   ... they would just run over and kick it and then that is when it would explode.   That is when it would detonate.   Right.   Huh.   I had a lot of those. Close to a dozen. And so that was a -- that was a difficult one because well it is combat because the Air Force dropped it because they were you know bombing the city.   Right.   But at the same time days weeks even months have gone by and this thing is just sitting in the ground. Could not we say it is not combat?   And this was a real question that John had to ask his boss. And then his boss asked his boss.   They eventually sent the question up to the Army Claim Service and they said No. It is combat.   Meaning they are not gonna pay.   Basically like we are in an armed conflict and this was an unfortunate incident but an incident that happened during a lawful combat operation and therefore we are sorry. And that is basically it.   So I said no to a lot of people.   And so like in World War I with General Pershing military officers they started lobbying their bosses for an expanded system so they could start making more payments. And eventually the military does expand it. In fact I talked to one of the military's top lawyers.   Brigadier General Richard C. Gross. I go by Rich. I am the legal counsel to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.   And he told me that around 2006 paying out these kinds of condolence payments actually became sort of a key part of military strategy.   Absolutely.   Even had its own acronym.   MAAWS. M-A-A-W-S. It is Money As A Weapons System which you know I am not sure that title resonates with everybody but ...   Interesting phrase for sure.   Yeah exactly. But it is the idea that money can be used to -- to win hearts and minds that help bring the population over.   And it just got me wondering how much money makes a good weapon?   Well I have not -- like the U.S. military has not given me access to a database or anything like that but through FOIAs and interviews I have seen different numbers.   Marla says that in 2006 the ACLU filed a FOIA request and eventually got their hands on hundreds of claims files. And in those files what you see are a bunch of different numbers but one that comes up again and again ...   2500.   2500 by and large.   Now someone like John could have paid more but that meant they would have to run the claim up the chain of command.   Exactly.   So it was almost like there were these ceilings.   2500 for a life. 1500 for property damage. And then eventually the property damage amount got raised to 2500 as well. And that -- that did not make any sense to me that somebody could get so much for a Toyota Corolla but you were not -- you were just gonna get the same amount for a lost life.   Like I cannot get over -- I mean 2500 seems like just such a nominal amount. And the practicality of that money of like if you were to kill someone who is the -- the breadwinner of a family that 2500 would not be able to support this family in any way.   Right. But we are not actually trying to pay full compensation right? Like we are not trying to say We think if this 20-year-old man had lived to be the average age in Afghanistan that he -- you know that it would have been 60843 right? Like that is not the thing.   Do you ever -- you know we had people who were killed here in an attack.     And those people have been compensated.   Mm-hmm.   The levels of compensation to the New York victims is pretty high.     Do you notice that?   I do. I do. But ...   It is to a large degree comparing apples and oranges.   That is General Gross again.   Because you are talking about a legal system ...   Where a country is paying their own victims ...   Versus condolences in an area where there is no legal obligation to make those payments in the first place.   So that is a very different type of monetary payment.   Well yes and no. Essentially it is a person's life. And ...   Yeah.   I mean I think there is an argument to be made that there is an empathy in the number that you come up with in the amount that you pay for someone's life.   I totally get what you are saying. The 2500 I think it is any amount of money. If I told you 10000 would you feel better about it?   I would feel a little bit better.   You would?   I think so. 10000?   What does it get you though? In the end 10000 does not buy anything more back than what you lost.   I do not know what 10000 gets you exactly in Afghanistan but my assumption is that it gets you a lot more than 2500.   But does that really help you? Is that really what you want?   Is the money unimportant to you really? It sounds like the money's really ...   I am not a victim so I do not know that I can answer that. To me if it happened ...   And at this point Marla told us a story about how before she got into this line of work ...   I had several friends who are journalists.   One of those friends was a man named Chris Hondros.   Yeah he is a photojournalist. He was a photojournalist.   And back in 2011 Chris was on assignment in Libya moving with a rebel group when they were fired upon. And Chris was killed.   Yeah.   And Marla says when she found out that happened ...   I wanted someone to explain to me why that happened. I mean I just wanted someone to explain. I did not -- you know like I knew his family was not gonna get any money. I knew that these guys that shot a rocket-propelled grenade at him were not gonna care. No one was gonna explain. But I wanted that.   And the money then becomes an occasion for you say like not just I am sorry but Here's what happened? It is the here's what happened part?   I think it is the token that is given with the apology and with the explanation.   But it is the apology and the explanation that matter to you.   Yeah that is why we call it amends. Making amends.   One of the things that is true of money damages generally is they are -- they are our desperate effort to find some common language between the party paying and the -- and the victim. Some Esperanto for communicating the meaning of what is happened in a language that the other side knows matters.   That is how John Witt puts it.   Because we see it everywhere we look. We see not just apologies. Sometimes not apologies at all. But we see the almighty dollar which is both distressing and also we know it is meaningful.   But the problem is in order for that Esperanto to work it has to say the same meaning to both sides. Which for John Tracy was not really about the money at all. Or not just about the money. It was as much about the envelope that the money was in. Or that there was a real person there to hand it to them.   I was not the one who raided their house. I was not the one who killed their daughter but most of them they -- you know just wanted to look at somebody who is in a uniform and say you really messed with my life.   And that opportunity is exactly what Abdullah Al-Tisi will never get. His son was killed by a drone he never saw operated by a man he will never meet on behalf of a country that still does not admit it was a mistake. And so the money he got which in the end he says was the equivalent of 30000 U.S. way more than anyone got in Iraq or Afghanistan. Still all he can do without anything else to go on is just compare amounts.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' Oh he can accept that only if -- if he gets you know the payment equal to those you know -- to like in America. How you compensate someone who lost his son for example. Killed.   If the payment was -- if the payment was equal.  ABDULLAH MOHAMMED AL-TISI' Yeah.   Producer Matthew Kielty.   Big thanks to Gregory Johnsen writer-at-large for BuzzFeed who started us off on this adventure when he brought us the initial story.   And also thanks to BuzzFeed editor Steve Kandell.   And to Shahib Al-Masawa for helping Matt organize that interview in Yemen when the country's going through an awful lot of tumult and he was able to get interviews that we did not think he could get.   Yeah absolutely. Thank you to him. Coming up? Bzzzzz ...   Bzzzzz ...   That is next.                       Okay now it is my left ear. Hello Soren how are you?   Good. How you doing?   I am good.   Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And so far we have been talking about the value of our lives ...   And then the value of other people's lives.   Next up? The value of ...   Everything.   All of it.   Everything.   Ev-ery-thing. And by everything of course we mean ...   The value of nature.   That is Carl Zimmer. Science writer regular blower of minds.   So we think of ecosystems as just kind of sitting there. But actually they are doing things. If they were not doing them for us we would have to pay to do them artificially. For example cotton farms in South Texas.   Hmm.   So you know the farmers are doing their thing.   Like this guy.   James Parker.   Planting their cotton. They are collecting it.   I farm about I do not know usually five to six seven hundred acres of cotton. So say 2000 bales.   They are doing what farmers do.   I spend a lot of time on a tractor. And you have to check your water every morning every evening.   Meanwhile they have all this extra help in the air.   Yes.   They have bats.   How many bats are out there? You really do not know.   Flying all around. The bats eat the equivalent of two-thirds of their own weight in insects every night.   Wow.   They eat all night long all kind of bugs.   A whole bunch of pests that would otherwise be eating the cotton.   Now a few years ago ...   A guy named John Westfall ...   Did a calculation.   Just to see how this arrangement was working out.   He came out to my farm and did a study. He had some college girls that worked for him. And those girls were out there all hours of the night listening to what the bats were saying. And ...   Each year the farmers collectively they make about 4- or 5-million off of these farms.   The question was how much of this was because of the bats? Because you know bats are natural pesticides.   You know the more they are eating the less I got to spray.   And here's what the scientists figured out.   Out of 4- to 5-million it was around 700000 that you could ascribe to the bats.   It is just beautiful.   Wow! I mean it does make me think that if you are those farmers you should be compensating the bats somehow.      Yeah. Well yeah. It does give you a glimpse at the kind of scale of value economic value that nature has that we generally just totally ignore.   But we talked to a guy who did not ignore it.   My name is Robert Costanza.   In fact he took this way of thinking to the absolute limit.   Yes. So the question was what is the value of all of these ecosystem services globally?   All the services on earth.   Yeah it is bugs eating leaves.   Worms turning the soil.   Beetles chewing tree stumps.   Coral reefs protecting cities during storms.   Everything.   We tried to synthesize all of the studies that had been done around the country and the world.   Like that bat study except they did not just look at cotton farms they looked at ...   Tropical forests rivers and lakes coral reefs coastal wetlands inland wetlands the ocean woodlands temperate forests ...   You know it goes on and on.   ... grasslands ...   This must be some Excel spreadsheet.   It is kind of the Excel spreadsheet from hell.   It can get tricky.   So Costanza and his colleagues took all these different studies summed them together did a whole bunch of math and came up with a number.   Which in today's dollars is 142.7-trillion per year of services. That is more than all of the gross national products of the world. And that is how valuable the services of nature are.   Yeah. Let me ask you like I get -- I get the way this would work with a bat. Like the bats eating the bugs. But like how do you do it with like -- with like a -- like a field or something? Like do you just walk through and you are like Oh that is 20 bucks of services. That is 50. Like how do you even figure out what the services are?   Well they came up with a list. So the list kind of depends on the ecosystem you are talking about because different ecosystems provide different services. For example a salt marsh.   And we are in the water now.   We are in the water.   What is it? Wait a salt marsh is it like the Florida Wetlands but salty? I suddenly do not know what a salt marsh is.   Salt marshes are wetlands that are on the coast.   Got it.   Yep. We are standing in about a foot of water here. We are quickly approaching high tide.   We sent one of our producers Simon Adler to a nearby salt marsh.   Partially to haze him.   Your boots are much more waterproof than mine.   Yeah yeah.   But really to talk to this guy.   My name is Adam Whelchel and I am the Director of Science for The Nature Conservancy here in Connecticut.   And Adam gave Simon a kind of inventory of ...   Some of the services provided by coastal salt marshes. It is a stream of goods and services that have been provided over time.   One of the things that does is it takes water that is coming in from inland and that is laden with all sorts of pollutants all sorts of bad stuff.   The salt marsh will trap that water so that the pollutants settle and then very often the marsh grass will suck up that water into the roots ...   And clean it up.   Yup.   So you could ask very simply ...   How much would you have to spend to keep your water that clean?   Well there is one other study ...   Adam Whelchel said that scientists in New England have already figured that out.   For flood control water supply protection pollution control it is roughly about 31.22 per hectare per year.   Then you got to add the value of all the plants that feed the fish that end up on our dinner plates.   338 annually per acre.   Then there are the birdwatchers that buy lattes that support the local economy.   490 per hectare.   And then there is habitat provisioning.   The list goes on and on and on and on.   You do get kind of obsessed with it. You start -- like you start becoming an accountant and writing down numbers just furiously. And it gets you to think about nature in a different way than you had before.   There is this galling element though or this aspect. Like when I first came across ...   At this point our producer Tim Howard jumped into the interview. And you will also hear our producer Soren Wheeler in just a second.   I do feel like in an example like the salt marsh which cleans water that is all reliant on people being there that need the water. So if you did not have people there does that salt marsh cease to have any value?   But Tim have not you ever had a conversation with somebody who just does not get -- like if you make the aesthetic argument which is that nature should be -- should be preserved for its own sake there is a whole category of humanity that just does not respond to that argument. This becomes a way to talk across the aisle.   But it does still feel like demotes something of infinite value to something of a piddly value.   Well it cannot really be infinite value. I mean ...   Well like a mother's love. You do not think your mother's love is priceless? I mean -- you know?   Okay I totally accept that there is this sort of priceless aspect of nature. But if you are in the government in a very poor country you have some tough choices to make. If somebody comes to you and says okay you have got these lovely mangroves. Now it turns out that this sort of setting where the mangroves are is the perfect place for shrimp aquaculture.   Because shrimp farms need lots of sea water so it makes sense to put them by the sea.   We are gonna put in these farms we are gonna grow shrimp. You are gonna get millions and millions of dollars in tax revenue. If you are thinking about the -- the welfare of all the people in your country many of whom are starving that might be a really powerful argument. Now into that kind of a discussion you can bring in the fact that these mangroves are sitting there very quietly doing all sorts of incredibly valuable things. In fact they have done these kind of calculations. And in some cases the services that mangroves provide are four times more valuable than what you could get out with shrimp. So it is stupid. It is just stupid in a very basic sense to wantonly replace lots of mangroves with shrimp aquaculture.   Is that a hypothetical situation?   No no. That is what we are asked.   This is Glenn-Marie Lange. She is an environmental economist for the World Bank. and she says very often she finds herself in exactly this kind of conversation.   Particularly you know I work for the World Bank so our primary clients are governments.   Philippines Vietnam.   And when you are talking to a Minister of Finance and saying You know what? You really should ...   I know jobs are jobs but you need those marshes. They have value.   They will say Well yeah that is true. But that means I am gonna have to reduce the money that I put into the education budget. So you have got to really make a strong argument about the benefits. That is really where the rubber hits the road.   Well I mean that is it ...   Here's the counter-argument. It comes from Doug McCauley an ecologist at the University of California Santa Barbara.   The real danger is that we actually succeed. That we convince people that nature is valuable because it makes money. And then we are -- we are really in trouble in the many instances where it does not make us money.   What do you do in a situation he says where say a bunch of rivers are running dry and they are quote depreciating in value?   You know by the same logic that you trained me to think with we should go out and liquidate these natural assets. That makes me feel really uncomfortable.   He says it is just kind of a weird way to think about nature.   We had a proposal here in the state of California to make gay marriage legal. And economists had a look at this legislation and said This is expected to generate 163-million annually for the state of California. Well it is good to know that. I appreciate having that information in front of me. However when I am making a decision on this legislation and I would say that when many legislators voters average citizens are considering the issues at hand they are not thinking about whether they are gonna make a 160-million for the state. They are thinking about a different set of values.   On the other hand I want to say -- and this is based on my experience working in developing countries that when you do not put a value on these services basically they do not get counted.   They get implicitly assigned a value of zero according to Glenn-Marie Lange. And as we were debating this and going back and forth and back and forth we bumped into a story about what happens when all of these value of nature ideas are let loose into a world of fruits and trees and human uncertainty.  J.B.  The parable of the bees ...   We heard this first from writer J.B. MacKinnon who says the story begins ...  J.B.  In Mao County in central China. Rural area fairly remote.   Lush green mountains filled with apple orchards.  J.B.  And apple orcharding was the main business.   And according to J.B. in the 1990s ...  J.B.  The wild bees of Mao County slowly started to disappear. And there was a few different reasons given for that. It could have been the destruction of the habitat that the bees nested in the heavy honey harvesting that was not leaving enough food for the bees.   But the prevailing theory is actually an economic one because in the 1990s as China was shifting to a market-based economy apple producers were under pressure to produce more apples. So they started spraying pesticide.  J.B.  Probably it was a constellation of all of those things and a few others. End result is the bees stopped buzzing in Mao County.   Which if you are an apple farmer that is a disaster.  J.B.  As bees travel from flower to flower and search of nectar they are -- they are dusted with pollen which is the means by which flowers engage in sexual intercourse. So if you do not have the bees making the birds and the bees on the blossoms then -- then you do not get fertile flowers to turn into -- to turn into fruit.   And obviously if you are a fruit farmer and you have no fruit to sell you have no income.   So what do you do?  J.B.  You are an apple farmer and you do not have bees then you need to find some other way to pollinate the flowers. And I guess they concluded well we will have to do that ourselves by hand.   In Mandarin Chinese we say Rngng shufn. So it basically that means a manual pollination.   This is Harold Thibault.   I am a correspondent in China for the French newspaper Le Monde.   A couple of years ago he heard about the apple farmers in Mao County. So he flies to Chengdu and he and a friend hop in the car and ...   We drive for like five or six hours until we reach this village Nanshin.   Tiny little village.   It is like only a few houses. And then we took a smaller road in between the fields. And we actually saw that there were lots of farmers in the -- in the trees like on the apple trees.  J.B.  Straddling up on these often thin and spindly branches men and women that I have seen in photos in any case.   Harold and his friend took pictures and if you look at those pictures you will see the farmers holding a little brush.  J.B.  This little pollen brush that they would constructed using things like chopsticks and chicken feathers and cigarette filters.   And they would have a little bottle filled with pollen. And then what they would do they would dip the brush into the bottle and they would paint a flower blossom with the pollen. They dip their brush back into the pollen and they would paint the next flower blossom again. And they would dip the brush back in again and they would paint again and they would dip again and they would paint again ...  J.B.  To make sure that -- that all of the blossoms that they could possibly fertilize would be fertilized so that they would go on to produce fruit.   We are talking hundreds and hundreds of flowers per tree.   It was very strange to see humans doing the job of the bees.   God what a pain in the ass that sounds like.  J.B.  Yeah the image of this -- of these Chinese orchardists standing up in these spindly trees traveled around the world through environmental circles. And the message that it seemed to send was that you know this is what happens if you -- if you lose biodiversity you end up standing in the trees doing the job that the bees used to do on the wing.   For free.  J.B.  For free.   Those people were just like human bees.   But then this guy enters the story. This is Yunzhong Chen.   Yeah human bees.   Four years ago he traveled to Mao County to do a sort of economic analysis of just how much the loss of the bees was hurting the farmers of Mao County. But what he discovered weirdly was that the trees were producing more apples than ever.   More production more production. This can be confirmed. There are more production for hand-pollination apple trees than bee-pollination apple trees. Humans are more efficient.   Really?   You mean that people were doing it better than the bees had been doing it?   Yes.   A lot better.  J.B.  Fruit production went up 30 percent.   That is what the farmers told Yunzhong Chen which is kind of ...   Amazing. The only word I remember. Amazing. Because I think hand pollination can pollinate more thoroughly. They can pollinate every flower.   And bees do not pollinate every flower?  J.B.  Bees are a little bit -- you know they are a little bit uneven when it comes to pollinating.    You are so polite!  J.B.  They do not like it if its cold. They do not like it if it is damp. They do not like it if it is windy.   In all those cases bees often decide to stay indoors and just take the day off.  J.B.  But send people out there and tell them to pollinate every damn blossom and they are gonna do it. And there was the additional benefit of the people that you paid they would go to the bar they would buy groceries they would spend those earnings in their local communities in a way that obviously bees never did.   So here you had this whole story that was supposed to be about how important the bees are. You know this whole parable of biodiversity.   And it turns out maybe the lesson's just the opposite that actually we do not need bees. And maybe we never did.  J.B.  If we only measure things economically then we might conclude that -- that some species or some ecological processes just are not necessary in certain places. Or that we might even do better to take care of those processes ourselves.   Right. So let me find my notes about the wages exactly.   But there is one more chapter to this story. Harold Thibault told us that when he visited Nanchen ...   I talked with one farmer. His name is Zhang Zago. He is 38. And he said in his opinion the hand pollination might disappear in a few years.   Apparently as China's economy has continued to grow workers have started demanding better pay.   The wages are getting so high for the workers that the farmers have to employ to help them. Basically it is not efficient economically to do the hand pollination anymore. That is what is a lot of farmers say.   Now they are likely thinking Damn! We need those bees back!   Right. Yeah.   Problem is ...   There are no bees there in those villages anymore.   One farmer told Harold beekeepers in other parts of China are not gonna bring their bees to this area because they worry about the pesticides that the farmers have used. And as for when wild bees might come back?   Well for this we have no idea. It is very hard to make a prediction. If you ask the farmers they are like we will put it out. I do not know.   Here's where that story leaves me. It leaves me thinking that economics is just not a good way to go. Putting a value even a -- even a precise and thoughtful value on a bee or on a pound of pesticide you do it and you think you are smart. But then the value changes and the bees go from being worth a lot to being worth nothing to be worth everything all within a few years. This -- this is what markets do. They swing back forth. And we pretend that we can predict but we never can. So you cannot put a value on -- because you are always gonna be wrong. That is why economics is a dumb ...   Well no no no. I am gonna argue the other side for a second. Nowhere in this story did someone walk into the middle of the proceedings and say You know what? The bees do have value here's the number. In fact you know what? Carl when we were talking to him told us ...   You know there have been estimates that the value of the pollination that comes from wild bees is 190-billion.   So that is globally right? But still there was nobody in the room giving that kind of number. So the bees were inherently valued at zero.   But remember bees are valued at zero only until humans get valued more then bees go down bees go up. You have to have a lot of numbers in your head.   I get it. I get it. But here's what I like about this idea is that when you put a number on a bee or a bat or a marsh it is like an attempt to force a kind of long-term thinking. You cannot just say Do not do that. I mean that is the thing that like conservationists say. Do not do not do not. But if you say Do not do that because here's the value.   Here's the loss.   Yeah here's the loss. Well then that actually gives the whole precautionary do not thing some teeth.   Except for this. That if you go business-y on nature and you are wrong ...   There are irreversibilities.   That is how environmental economist Glenn-Marie Lange puts it.   This is one of the differences between nature ecosystems and what we produce. You smash your car? Hey someone can build a new one. If you lose the bees many instances you cannot bring them back.   So the question we got to is is there another way to think about the value of nature? I mean a way that is not economic and therefore short-sighted and all about us but also not simply about the aesthetics and the beauty because that can be sort of limiting too. Is there another way?  J.B.  The best I was able to do thinking about this ...   Writer J.B. MacKinnon again.  J.B.  Was when it struck me that -- that in a way all of this diversity that is out there all this biological diversity all these wonderful and amazing and alien things that other species can do is like an extension of our own brains. There is so much imagination out there that we simply could not come up with on our own that we can think of it as -- as a pool of imagination and creativity from which we as humans are able to draw. And that when we draw down on that -- on that pool of creativity and imagination we deeply impoverish ourselves. You know in a sense we are -- we are doing harm to our own ability to think and to dream.   J.B. MacKinnon's book is called The Once and Future World. He is written many but this one is my fave.   Deep thanks to Carl Zimmer whose reporting in the New York Times on this topic is really what got us launched into this whole thing.   And what got us through this whole thing is Simon Adler whose production assistance was invaluable. That was him ...   Freezing his ass off in the marsh.   I talked so long he nearly died. His toes fell off I think. Anyway thank you Simon.   Thank you Simon. And thank you guys for listening. I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   We will see you next time.
