   All right.   Hello.   Hey.   How are you doing?   I am doing.   Maybe just say who you are real quick before we start?   Pat Walters. I am a Senior Editor here.   Excellent. So where do we start? I mean do you want to tell me how you got into all this?   Yeah okay. So -- so the -- so we are doing this series. And this all started for me or I got thinking about the thing we are about to talk about a lot because of this -- this moment several months ago where I sort of got caught between two of my closest friends. I got caught just -- I get caught between them all the time.    Is it -- is it a political caught?   Its actually really hard.   Political caught?   Yeah. So friend number one is this guy. I would call him a bit of a contrarian politically. And we ended up getting in a few arguments about this guy named Jordan Peterson.     Who ...   Right.   ... you probably know. Hes a Canadian.   Public figure-type person.   Public figure. Canadian psychologist who is -- has gotten -- hes said a lot of things that are very controversial about gender and race.     Like he thinks white privilege is a myth and he said we should somehow enforce monogamy.   Hes sort of like a mans movement -- hes big with dudes.   Hes really big with white dudes.   Yeah.   And this friend of mine is a white dude. And so we were arguing about some things Jordan Peterson had said that my friend had liked. And at one point he was just -- he said to me he kind of called me out. He was like Youve never even listened to the guy talk. Like were having all these arguments about his ideas and youve never even listened to him. So I was like Okay.   Fair point.   Thats fair. And so I decided I would listen to him. And then enter friend number two. We are hanging out later a couple days later and I told her I am having a fight with Friend Number One. Again. He wants me to listen to this guy Jordan Peterson. I told him Id do it just to be fair. And she -- she just got this look on her face and was like Why would you do that? And then she said this thing to me that really stuck with me afterwards. And she said His ideas are dangerous. And I remember thinking like What makes an idea dangerous? Even stepping beyond politics thinking about science or thinking about the law or all these sort of realms of ideas what makes one so dangerous or threatening or risky that we shouldnt even talk about it?   Hmm.   And so I decided to have a staff meeting with all of the Radiolab people and I asked everyone to bring their most dangerous idea. Just as a thought experiment. People brought all kinds of weird stuff. And I have ...   I remember there were some fights in that meeting.   There were some fights. Yeah. Someone was like maybe there is one species that we should like just agree we are gonna let go. We only have a limited amount of time energy and money. Stop worrying about the elephants let them all die and we are just going to focus on other things.   Uh-huh.   A soft one. Recycling is pointless. That is probably just true.      Someone brought like the idea that boys are better at math than girls.   Right.   A female staff member brought that one in because she heard it from her daughters math teacher.   Thats crazy that people think that still.   There was the idea that breast cancer screening is pointless.   Uh-huh.   There was something about a law in Nebraska that allowed you to drop off a baby that you did not want.   Right.   God is dead. Assisted suicide. Psychiatric euthanasia. One producer brought a book that some guy had written arguing that like mass incarceration is a tragedy and a solution would be instead of putting people in prison we should bring back public -- whip -- whippings. So like instead of ...   That is what it was.   ... being sent to prison.   That is when -- thats when things devolved a tiny bit.   Yeah. But before they did more than one person brought the same idea. And this idea really stuck in my head. Like we -- a group of us kind of became obsessed with it. And that is the idea we decided to base this series on. And I am not going to tell you what it is. Yet.   All right.   All right. Im Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. Over the next five episodes we are gonna turn things over to our Senior Editor Pat Walters who is gonna explore this mysterious dangerous idea in all kinds of weird places. Were calling this series and this will make sense in a little bit. We are calling it G.   There is nothing I love more than picking the lint off my myself.   Wow!   It is like a little game built into my clothing.   Youre so easy to please.   Before we get started I should say that I produced this whole series with Rachael Cusick. She is been a true partner on the whole project so youll be hearing from her a bunch too. And this first episode began with a discovery that she made one day when she was looking around on the internet.   One of my favorite pages is Today I Learned.   I love -- I do love Today I Learned. I love a good ...   Its amazing.   If you do not know this is a section of Reddit.   And so I went there. I am scrolling like just the general page. And then I see a Today I Learned headline that kind of stopped me in my tracks.   Mm-hmm.   And Im just gonna read it.   Okay.   Hold on its very small font.   Yeah yeah yeah okay.   And it says TIL -- Today I Learned -- that it is illegal in the state of California to administer an IQ test to a child if he or she is Black even when dispensed by a school psychologist as part of a professional assessment.   Wait. It says it is illegal to give an IQ test to a Black kid in California?   Yeah. That is what it said.   Do you click on it?   I totally click on it.   Okay.   Because I am looking to find out that it is fake for sure.   Yeah.   So I start reading the comments.   Mm-hmm.   And theyre really vile. Very racist. They mostly came from a group of people who call themselves race realists. And those are people who basically say Lets just all agree that white people are inherently more intelligent than Black people.   Okay so you see these responses youre like ...   Yeah. Im like this Black kids cant take IQ tests thing cant be real.   Whoa! Like my head was spinning for a little while. I am like Yo!      But it is.   This is for real son!   After Rachel found that website we started calling around asking people about this. And one of the first people we talked to is this guy. His name is Brandon Gambel.   Im banging on the table. Im so excited about this.   Hes the Dean of Student Success at Oakwood University in Huntsville Alabama. But back in the mid-'90s Brandon had just gotten a job as a school psychologist in Long Beach California.   First day on the job I got on like a nice white shirt its short sleeves and a tie.   And on his first day his two supervisors they took him aside into an office and told him about this thing called the Larry P. rule.   I was like Whos Larry and why should I be concerned about that? And my supervisor he was like Well -- like his affect changed. He was like Oh man um well it basically says that -- and hes kind of dancing around it. But hes like Oh yeah. Because of Larry P. we cant give IQ tests with African American students.   And are these two white men that are telling you this?   Yes they are.  Yeah they are. And then they kind of look to me like Well what do you think? It like put us in an awkward -- like up until that moment theyre my supervisor. Now theyre at a loss as to what to do and to talk about.   Eventually he says they pulled out a big three-ring binder opened it to a section in the middle.   You know Roman numeral 4 page 2.   And they show him a list of about 20 different IQ tests that he was not allowed to give to Black kids.   And Im reading this stuff and Im freaked out.   Can I just ask a basic question? IQ tests. People still use IQ tests?   Well like you you know I thought they were something that had been tossed out years ago.     I mean of course you still hear IQ tests talked about by ...     President Trump.     Jordan Peterson.     But when we started looking into it it quickly became clear that IQ tests are kind of all over the place.     Thousands of companies use them to pick employees.     Every branch of the military uses them. Theyre used in the justice system.       Even in football.     And theyre kind of massive in schools. More than a million kids get IQ tested every year. They are used mainly to figure out which kids will get into gifted programs and which kids will get special-ed services. But in California if your kid is Black they almost definitely wont get one.   And its all because of this Larry P. thing?   Yeah.   So then ...   Whos Larry P?   Yeah whos Larry P?   Okay so let me bring in Lee Romney.   I am an education reporter for KALW Radio.   And last year she got kind of obsessed with that question.   Of course Larry P. is a case.   A lawsuit. But the problem was the guy at the center of that case Larry P. that was a pseudonym. And the actual guy whoever he was had basically vanished. No one had heard from him in about 40 years. But Lee was able to track him down in a small neighborhood just outside Seattle.   Yeah I knocked on the door and he came and I said ...   Hi. Im Lee.   Im Darryl.   Nice to meet you.   Nice to meet you too.   Turns out his name is Darryl Lester.   Welcome.   I warned ya. I warned you guys that Id have these little things on. But ...   Oh okay.   Yeah. Thanks so much.   Hes about 60 years old now. The lawsuit happened back in the 1970s. And he was very surprised that this reporter had showed up wanting to talk to him about something that had happened back when he was like 10.   Threw me -- threw me a loop. But it happened so many years ago. You want to sit down over here?   We can. Can we turn off the ...   Yes.   Yeah the sound. Because it makes it hard to ...   Right.   Whenever there is a song because sometimes I think Oh its so nice ...   So Lee and Darryl sat down in the living room and Lee asked him to tell his story. From the beginning. It starts back in the 1960s.   Okay so maybe go back a little. So you are from -- you guys are from Georgia?   Yeah.   Where in Georgia did you grow up?   Marietta.   With how many brothers and sisters?   Four brothers and we -- my mom lost her only daughter. So she ended up with five boys. I am the youngest.   The story begins in 1965. And that year Darryl's mom ...   And your mom was -- was she working?   She is a nurse.   She decided to take the whole family -- she and her five boys -- and move them to San Francisco because she wanted to get away from segregation. And this was at a time when the Civil Rights Movement is like ...   We was there during the '60s.   At its peak.   And man it was so gorgeous there during the '60s. That was a gorgeous city.   And little Darryl is suddenly in this like radically different world.   Yeah he was in a much more diverse place.   I had some nice good white buddies. My white buddy his name was Tom. . Me and him played on the 49ers. That was our football team.   And every day ...   Wed do our work and then hed ride his bike over to my house and Id get on the back of his bike and wed ride to football practice.   So they were -- you know they were tight.   It was just a whole change of atmosphere.   Darryl even remembers this one time where he and his brother went to this festival.   It was in the Golden Gate Park.     Me and my brother went to it. We were kids.         And I remember the police picking us up putting us on the horse.   And he got to ride this horse all around the park.   I remember all of that.   So everything was going pretty well for Darryl. Except for school.   We lived on that little slanted street like hill like. And then if you walked down the block and turned right its a steep hill. A real steep hill. You go up that hill and the school was on top of the hill there. That was the first school I went to when we first got there. And I stayed in trouble. And it was terrible. The kids was just way too fast. Coming from the country coming from Georgia.   He said he got teased and he said he would just have these outbursts.   And then I would come home and I would tell my mom I do not wanna go to school. You know I would just had enough. She said No you are going to school. You are -- you are gonna go and you are gonna learn.   So he is having a little bit of trouble.   What grade were you in then?   Uh first grade.   And then one day in the first grade a teacher grabs Darryl and a couple other kids pulls them out of class and walks them down the hallway to this room.   Do you remember what kinds of questions they maybe were asking you?   In school?   For the test.   They did it all -- they did it -- they did all of us.   Darryl's a little fuzzy on this part but apparently when he and the other kids walked in there was a man standing in the front of the room and the man pulled out this maroon briefcase.   Wow this has never been used!   We found one on eBay.    Ooh it smells like my basement.   Wow okay. So it says the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children. Copyright the Psychological Corporation New York City. This is the thing that like in some ways like yeah changed his life.   Even though Darryl doesnt remember all the details from that day here's how we think it would have gone down.   Alright. Im going to open it up.   The man at the front would have taken out a bunch of little green booklets.     And the tests are general information general comprehension arithmetic vocabulary ...     One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve tests.     Darryl said -- he said really from the very -- from the very beginning he said he did fine in math.   I am good when it come to numbers.   But he could not keep up with the reading.   When I look at something and Im trying to read it and if I cant pronounce it Im looking at it backwards.   The reality was that he had a reading issue -- Im sure its fair to call it like a reading disability.     Its hard I think.   It -- it was just like very hard.     Like Oh you gotta be kidding me!   So Darryl goes home. Hes not really sure what happened but he feels like he didnt do well at it whatever it was. And eventually someone from the school approaches Darryl's mom and says We need to put your son in a different class.   So the way she describes it in her testimony it says Well I was told that Larry was a slow learner and he needed the help you know in his schoolwork. And by putting him in this class I was under the impression he was put there so he could get more attention.   Thats when stuff started going downhill.   In Darryls new class there were 10 students.   It was mostly Black.   Four boys six girls.   And what -- what was like a normal day like in there?   A normal day? A headache. A straight up headache because some kids was loud some kids was obnoxious. Some kids just didnt care.   Darryl says they spent about ten minutes a day on reading ten minutes a day on math and about five-and-a-half hours outside.   And they thought that would calm us down.   So they went on a lot of field trips.   Going to the zoo Golden Gate Park. What is this you know? They wasnt teaching us nothing. You know I walked to school and cried all the way. And by the time I got close to the school Id straighten up and got myself together went on into the building and that was it. It was that bad.   Darryl was in that class for more than a year. And then fast forward and one day Darryls mom is at home and she gets a phone call.   Well she gets a phone call apparently from one of the NAACP attorneys.   And the lawyer tells her that a man named Gerald West is gonna pay her a visit. He says West is a member of the Association of Black Psychologists.   And so the way she describes it in her testimony she -- she said Okay. And then Gerald West came over.   Met with Darryl. Gave him a few tests.   And that when he was done she says -- you know she says Then he turned to me and he says 'Well there is nothing wrong with this child.' And I said 'What do you mean nothing wrong with him? I am his mother. I should know. You know I am his mom I know there is -- you know there is nothing wrong with him.' Even though she did know that he needed reading help. But she says Naturally I did not feel good about it and I got angry about it. This is when I really found out what was really going on you know? And then she is asked What did you find out? And -- and the mom says That he is been designated mentally retarded. That is how she learned that he was in a class for educable mentally retarded kids. She would never known that.   What had happened to Darryl when he got brought into that room with the man with the briefcase is theyd given him an IQ test. Thats what had gotten him designated -- and this is the term that was used at the time and so were gonna use in it this story -- educably mentally retarded. And his mom said he wasnt that the test was wrong and that it had been wrong about a lot of Black kids. And so Darryl's mom and the parents of five other little kids got together and filed a class-action lawsuit against the school district arguing that their kids had been essentially denied their education by being put in these classes inappropriately because of an IQ test that deemed them mentally retarded. And that is yeah that is sort of the beginning of -- of this whole thing. And -- so what ends up happening is like in the mid-1970s these parents essentially put the IQ tests on trial. That is after the break.       Hey welcome back! This is G a Radiolab mini-series. This is episode one. I am Pat Walters.   Jad Abumrad. You were saying that the IQ test was put on trial. That sort of seems to be where were driving to.   Mm-hmm.   I want to know about that trial. What happened at the trial?   Yeah it is super interesting. But before we jump into that I think it would be helpful to put the trial and the tests in a slightly larger context.   Okay.   And so to do that I want to tell you where the IQ tests came from in the first place.   You mean like who invented it?   Yeah all the way back to the beginning of these tests.   Well alright.   And to do that we have to go back to France.   In the early 1900s.   1904.   Yes.   This is Siddhartha Mukherjee.   I am an oncologist and I am also a writer.   And the beginnings of all this he says ...   Arose out of one might describe them as benign intentions.   At the turn of the century in France there was a lot going on.     The church and the state were separating.   Trying to create this equal society.   This by the way is David Robson.   Senior journalist at BBC Future and I am the author of The Intelligence Trap.   And David says one of the things that happened at this time is the government took over the schools.     Universal education was part of that and then ...   Suddenly all kids were required to go to school. And within the first few years of this the government noticed that some kids were falling behind. And so to figure out what to do they called this psychologist.   Alfred Binet in Paris at the time.   Who was actually the Director of Experimental Psychology at the University of Paris. He had studied all kinds of things but hed spent the past 20 years or so studying children. And so the French government gave him an assignment. They said We want you to come up with a test to sort of predict which kids are gonna struggle in school.   Just to identify whether children were more vulnerable I guess in the schoolroom.   So that we can give them extra ...   Give them extra help yeah. And so it does not like go on through years. And then we are like Oh crap! Jad is like three years behind now. We did not notice that he is having a really hard time learning to read or do math.     Yeah yeah yeah. Exactly. So he worked with Theodore Simone ...   His assistant at the time.   And together they came up with this test to look for ...   A whole bunch of different cognitive abilities. Starting with simple ones like can the child hold a conversation with the teacher moving on to slightly more complex ones.   Such as he would give the children a list of words ...   Like house fork mother.   And ask them to kind of recite them back to him from memory.   He made the children draw pictures. And then he had a few harder ones. Like name three rhymes for the French word reverence which is like a bow or curtsy. Anyway he had all these questions. Some were easy some were hard. And the next thing he did is he gave these tests to a whole bunch of kids. Grouped them all by age and then he compared how they did. Like for all the six-year-olds how many questions did they get right and wrong on average? For the seven-year-olds same thing. Eight-year-olds on and on. For each age he calculated the average score.   Basically a norm -- a normalization as it were.   What they ended up calling the normal score. And then he would compare each kid to that norm. So if youre a six-year-old and you got the average number right and wrong for a six-year-old he would say thats your ...   Mental age.   Six. If you scored higher than the average for a six-year-old your mental age might be seven or eight. And if you scored lower it might be lower.   And then    Ultimately that would lead to a simple math equation.   The mental age divided by the chronological age times by a hundred gave you the IQ or intelligence quotient.   Oh so thats how they do it?   Yeah. Its a little different now but generally how it works is like if youre a six-year-old and you get the number of questions right and wrong that the average six-year-old got right and wrong your IQ score is 100.   And if your mental age exceeds your physical age you get higher than a hundred. If your mental age is less than your physical age you get lower than a hundred.   So thats the basic idea. Now before Binet teachers and parents and lots of other kinds of people had been trying all different things to figure out how kids learn and to compare them to their peers. But this is the first time someone tried to measure it and put a number on it. Now Binet he was very clear that he did not think he was measuring everything about intelligence. You know this is not the whole picture. Im just measuring something about these kids that helps me figure out how theyre gonna do in school.   Binet was very explicit about the fact that he did not think the mark in his tests should be considered a permanent thing about someone.   Hmm.   He called it brutal pessimism if you take that one score and you think of it as defining someone.   He said brutal pessimism.   Yeah. He believed that intelligence was malleable and that the human mind had you know so many different facets that had to be considered.   He was apparently adamant about this. But as we know good intentions are the devils toilet paper. Because right around the time Binet was doing his thing ...   Charles Spearman who was a statistician ...   Where was he and what was he doing?   He was in England.   It was another psychologist.   You know a psychologiststatistician doing research on this topic.   A guy named Charles Spearman who came up with the theory of intelligence that Binet would not have liked. This guy that youre hearing by the way ...   My name is Stuart Ritchie. I am a psychology lecturer at King's College London.   Hes the guy who kind of told me all about this. And according to him Charles Spearman like Binet also worked with kids. Gave them lots of tests. And he noticed this sort of counter-intuitive thing that Bidet had not. You know how I mentioned that IQ tests are actually many many little tests all lumped together? Like you got vocabulary math all these different sub-tests?   Mm-hmm.   Well what Spearman showed in his analyses of the tests were that they all seemed to correlate positively together. People who are good at one type of test tend to be good at them all.     What Spearman noticed is the kids who were good at ...   Vocabulary tests.     Those kids were also likely to be good at ...   Reasoning tests.     And pattern recognition.     They tend to be good at speed tests memory tests.     Across all the different kinds of tests ...   People who are good at one are good at them all.   And he saw this as evidence of some sort of underlying ...   Mental energy that underlies their cognitive abilities.   And Spearman called this ...   General intelligence.   The concept of G.   And this idea that this sort of general intelligence that Spearman noticed did other scientists notice it too?   Oh yeah. Yes. Yeah.   Stuart says in the decades since Spearman first noticed this phenomenon ...   1904.   ... it has been proven again and again and again to be true.   Its essentially one of the best replicated findings in the psychological literature.   And the moment this G idea got walked out into the room by Charles Spearman this is the moment that Pandora's Box sort of got ripped wide open. Because now there were not lots of different kinds of intelligences. Intelligence was not complicated. There was just this one kind. And Spearman believed we each had a certain amount of it from the time we were born. And that that could somehow be measured with a test.     And this is exactly the thing Binet warned against. This is that brutal pessimism. He never got a chance to speak out against the test being used this way. He died in 1911. And in the years after his death throughout the teens and twenties and thirties IQ tests were given to millions of people used to decide who should get which job ...     Who should get into which school ...     Who should be allowed to immigrate to one country or another. And eventually who should be institutionalized and forcibly sterilized. Because the thing we have not mentioned about Charles Spearman and a lot of these early intelligence scientists is they were eugenicists. And so the whole early history of IQ testing is wrapped up in this ideology you know that these guys thought they could selectively breed people to create some kind of master race. And we are gonna go deep into that part of the history in a future episode with the help of Lulu Miller one of the creators of Invisibilia. But suffice to say once IQ tests were being used to pick people to be sterilized it just kept getting worse.     This was not a peripheral idea to Nazism. The measurement was central to the Nazi doctrine of improving the human race. And in their case it marched onto exterminations.   The Nazi version of eugenics started in the mid-1930s when they began forcibly sterilizing and then executing thousands of people that they would classified as mentally ill disabled or what they called feeble-minded. Meaning that they would scored low on an IQ test. This program was called T4 and it was a precursor to and essentially a training ground for the mass executions of Jewish people that over the next several years would become the Holocaust.   So in the span of just about 30-35 years you go from something called G to selective sterilization mandated by a court to selective extermination mandated by a state. And that happens in the span of 30 years.   Now given that history I kind of expected that after World War II IQ tests would have gone away. But no. Here in America ...   America particularly around that time in the post-war period was a very quantitative society.   The economy was booming and we were obsessed with measuring things.   Your height your weight. You know your biometrics.   So in America we doubled down on the use of IQ tests. Started using them for everything.   To track people. Earmarking people for the right jobs. Making sure they get to the right schools etcetera etcetera. There is a kind of efficiency clause in this which is you know let us make the society more efficient by allocating the right resources to the right people.   And so by the '60s and '70s Mukherjee says that was the situation.   It had really seeped into the center of American culture.   Are we at the trial now?   Just about.     What gets us to the trial is right around the time Larry P. bumped into the test people had finally started to push back against it. The Civil Rights Movement was in full swing and this group of young Black psychologists had stepped up and said Hey this test is a problem. Not only because of its history but also because of the way its made now.   The tests did not consider the experiences and the backgrounds of minorities or Black children or children who did not have a white middle-class background.   They were culturally specific to European Americans.   Thats psychologist Brandon Gamble again. Before him Harold Dent who was one of those young Black psychologists who started pushing back in the 1960s. And Dent says the problem was like remember how I told you the IQ test is normed? Where they give the test to a whole bunch of kids and clump their scores together to sort of figure out the average score for each age?   Mm-hmm.   Well the test-makers only used white kids.   If you set up one standard everybody doesnt meet that standard.   And so these Black psychologists were like What about non-white kids?   If that child is not from that cultural frame and that cultural experience they may give different answers.   The IQ test scores did not deal with the background and experiences of Black children.   Which is what this lawsuit ended up being about.     Okay!   Like if we were to try to imagine ourselves into day one of this trial like what do we know?   We know it was a federal case so it was in US District Court.   This is Lee Romney again.   Downtown San Francisco. You know just a couple of blocks from City Hall.   Do you know what the room would have looked like?   We know from the court sketch that right behind the witness stand was a giant American flag. You know the judge seated there next to the witness box.   The judge was named Robert Peckham.   He was a mostly bald gentleman.   Wire-rimmed glasses.   Spoke somewhat quietly.   So you have got Peckham up in the front and then the lawyers for the families.   A number of attorneys.   One of whom you just heard.   Armando Menecal.   At the time of the trial Armando had only been a lawyer for about four years.   I was the only lawyer that was in court every day. Myself and the chief lawyer for the state.   Well this trial started in October of 1977.   It would go on for seven months.   10000 pages of witness testimony.   10114 pages.      Oh my God!   Yeah.   Did you go through all of it?   I did. But like I whipped through some of it because ...   One of the first big things that happens is the plaintiffs called this guy named Asa Hilliard to the stand.   The late Dr. Asa Hilliard.   He had been the dean of the School of Education at San Francisco State University.   Black psychologist.   He was a big expert on racial bias in education and testing.   Yep. Yep.   So Hilliard goes up to the stand gets sworn in.   And if you -- if you have a second I will try to find ...   And one of the family's lawyers stands up and picks up this box.   Exhibit P-66a.   And walks over to the stand.   And then he says Let me hand you this black box and ask you if you can identify this for the court. He says This is what the actual beast looks like.   He calls it the beast?   Yeah. And so Hilliard says Right. This is a kit for the WISC.   The Wechsler Intelligence Skills for Children.   A.K.A. ...   The WISC.   Which was the main test that was being used in schools. Okay so this is -- this is Madden again.   And the first thing they do is ask Hilliard just to like explain what this test is. Like what exactly is it asking these kids?   So Hilliard says Right. Let me try one. There is gonna be an actor right? So do you want me to read sort of around what -- what the actor is going to be doing?   I might just have you read a bunch of stuff.   Okay. Maybe I should not pick number nine ...     He picked this question from a section called General Information.     And in addition to those answers just being like wrong Hilliard brought this one up to point out that this is not a test of like thinking ability.   This is acquired knowledge.   Lee gave us another example.   Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?   Uh Shakespeare.   Yeah good job. Ding ding ding!   Thank you.   And then they say Tchaikovsky. Tchaikovsky is also acceptable.   Tchaikovsky wrote a Romeo and Juliet?   I -- see I did not know that. I did not know that.   Now the people who make these tests would explain to you that the point of a question like that is that a lot of kids will not know the answer. That is question number 16 so it is supposed to be hard. The point of it being on there is not that like knowing that information in particular is especially important but the test-makers have figured out that the kids who get that question right are more likely to do well on all the other parts of the IQ test because of that G thing we talked about before. The problem is there are all kinds of other variables at play here. Like whether you know who wrote Romeo and Juliet might say something about your intelligence but it might also just be an indication of whether your parents told you about Shakespeare or whether you learned about him in school.     And Hiliard argued this acquired knowledge problem affected a whole bunch of different parts of the test.   That would be the same thing here on math. If children ...     For example you are supposed to be able to answer the question in what way are salt and water alike?   In what way are salt and water alike? Okay. In what way are salt and water ...   Do they have two compounds. Does that make them a thing?   H2O and NaCl? No.   That seems ridiculously complicated.   I mean I would say -- I mean the first thing that comes to mind for me is like ...   Oceans.   Oh ocean. Like they get mixed together.   Rachael. You actually -- you -- you got the high score right out of the gate.   Whoa!   So -- okay. So here it is. You get two points if you give this answer A response that indicates that they are both necessary for life or that they are both chemical compounds. Ding ding ding!   Whoo!   So those are the only two answers that you get two points for. If you say that they are both in the ocean you get no points.   What? That is just a truth. Why does that ...   I know!   Oh I am angry!   If you say that you can drink both of them you get no points. If you say salt comes out of the water ...   Again there is not really a single right answer. Id argue that my answer was just fine. But Hilliard explained that the WISC favors a certain kind of answer.   There is an arbitrary decision about the nature ...     He said the WISC arbitrarily favors abstract-sounding answers like salt is a compound. And he is asked why is that any more intelligent than saying salt is from the ocean?     And his point was thinking abstractly in this way is as acquired as knowing who wrote Shakespeare. Now the state argued there are big parts of the test that do measure things that feel way more like pure thinking abilities. There is a memory test where a kid just has to read back a string of numbers. There are a couple of pattern recognition tests that just involve looking at shapes. Theres a picture completion test where a kid just has to point out whats missing from a drawing. But for every part of the test like that theres another part that feels way squishier. And the part of the test where you see racial bias most blatantly is this one called ...   Comprehension.   This is Brandon Gamble again.   And with comprehension they may ask somebody kind of a moral question even.   The kid is given a hypothetical social situation and asked how they should respond. Like what should you do if you cut your finger? Or why are criminals locked up? Or why is it generally better to give money to a charity than someone begging on the street? Or why should a promise be kept? And Brandon says like a lot of parts of this test these questions dont have a single right answer which means they can be biased towards people who answer the question in the way the people who made the test think it should be answered. Which is a big problem if you dont think the way the people who made the tests think. Brandon told us about one of these questions that he ran into when he started working as a school psychologist.   If you found somebody's wallet ...   Like sitting on a shelf in a store.   What would you do with it? Would you give it back to them? You know try to search them out and find out how to give it back to them? Or would you leave it alone? Or keep that money?   The correct answer is find the store manager and give them the wallet. But Brandon told me he would not have answered it that way.   I would have said you know Im not touching it because theyd probably accuse me of something.   Because youre Black?   Yeah. And you know what? Ive been in that situation. I went with a scouting group and my mother was the director of the scouting group and we were at a science museum. Im a nerd. I didnt realize it back then how much of one I was but I was wearing my scouting uniform which had this shiny belt buckle. So I keep shining it but I get smudges on it. So I am looking at my belt buckle and theyre thinking Im stuffing my pants with things. So -- and so security gets called.   Oh jeez!   And I have no idea what is going on but my mother does. My mother is like youre not strip-searching my child.   Point is Brandon says if youre a black kid and you see that question you might think clearly the correct answer is leave the wallet where it is.   So really what the WISC is measuring is assimilation into American culture and how well you assimilate as a predictor. Not so much your actual intelligence and what you know.   So the families put forward a bunch of arguments saying the test is racially-biased. And then the state gets up and has to defend the test. And their argument basically goes like    There is nothing wrong with tests. That they are just as valid you know to use for all you know American-born English-speaking kids.   This is Craig Frisby. He is a school psychology professor at the University of Missouri and has done a bunch of research on the Larry P. case and bias in testing. And he says it is not enough for a test question just to feel like its biased.   You always have to go back to the data and say what does the data say and does the data bear this out?   You have to prove statistically that it is.   And in a lot of these arguments the data just doesnt bear it out.   So like take that question who discovered America? According to Craig to prove that that question is biased against let us say Black children you would have to give that question to a group of white children and give the same question to a group of Black children and show that the Black children are more likely to get it wrong than the white children. And Craig says the families in the lawsuit did not do that.   You know you are kind of -- kind of shooting in the dark a little bit. Well this could be this could be. So whenever you try to kind of give an ad hoc explanation for what you see it is not a scientific enterprise.   But the reason ironically that data did not exist is because like we said before the IQ test that was given to the kids like Darryl was only normed was only standardized on white kids.   And everyone admitted that no one had attempted in the testing companies -- had attempted to validate the test for Blacks and whites.   Still Craig says the state argued that the families did not have the data they would need to prove their case statistically. But the data the state did have Craig says showed that when you do give IQ tests to Black kids you find the entire range of scores that youd see in white kids.   So if tests were truly biased against kids because of their skin color or their race then you would never have examples of African Americans who get high scores on IQ tests and you would never have examples of white kids who get low scores on IQ tests.   And so the state said like if Black children can score very high on IQ tests how could they be biased?   You have the full range.   But even though you see that entire range you see something else too.   The means the averages differ from group to group.   The average shifts down. The average score of Black kids was lower than the average score of white kids.     So if the state was saying there was no bias what explains that discrepancy then?   One of the first things that people will say that -- to pour gasoline on the issue is to say Oh if youre saying the tests are not biased then that means that this group is genetically inferior to this other group.   And there was a huge controversy happening in America at this time over that very idea.       And the defense the state actually tried bringing this argument into the lawsuit.   They had introduced it in some of the pre-trial paperwork as a possible defense.   But when they were getting ready to go to trial ...   Wilson Riles.   The State Superintendent of Education who was the named defendant in the case and happened to be a Black man himself ...   Says this stuff is racist and disgusting and vile. And I cannot be a part of that and I especially cannot have the state be a part of that.   And so the defense never directly brought that argument up in trial.   They sort of took it back.   And that was kind of the ghost in the room.   And even though the state kind of tried to shuffle that argument back under the rug the families lawyers wanted to disprove out in the open.   What we were attempting to prove is that that test mislabeled blacks as being intellectually inferior.   Thats Armando Menecal again and he says they called bunch of different witnesses.   A whole parade of experts.   Medical background historians many psychologists many education experts.   To show in court there is no evidence to support that theory. It is just not true.   And then eventually he would say And theres three times more Blacks in classes for the retarded. It either means that blacks are genetically inferior to whites ...   Which theyd just spent weeks disproving.   Or the tests are discriminatory. Eventually you get down to the eitheror. And that was our goal in cross-examination. And we called every one of the state employees as adverse witnesses and cross-examined them ...   And there was one encounter with a Department of Education employee.   The main guy within the department in charge of the classes for the mentally retarded and the IQ test.   That Armando says pretty much stops everyone in their tracks.   I would pretty much gotten him into a corner where he basically admitted that yes he believed that there were more mentally retarded Black people than white people. And Peckham goes Wait wait wait wait. Are you saying you really believe that there are more Blacks who are mentally retarded? And the guy said Yes!   October 16th 1979.   Judge Peckham issues his ruling.   He just comes right out and says This court finds in favor of plaintiffs.   Darryl his mom and the five other families won the case.   Defendants have utilized standardized intelligence tests that are racially- and culturally-biased have a discriminatory impact against Black children and have not been validated for the purpose of essentially permanent placements of Black children into educationally dead-end isolated and stigmatizing classes for the so-called educable mentally retarded. He says We must recognize at the outset that the history of the IQ test and of special education classes built on IQ testing is not the history of neutral scientific discoveries translated into educational reform. It is a history of racial prejudice of social Darwinism and of the use of the scientific quote 'mystique' to legitimate such prejudices. Defendants' conduct in connection with the history of IQ testing and special education in California reveals an unlawful segregative intent. To dumb it down he is basically saying they proved everything that they set out to prove. That this was just a disguised form of segregation you know under the guise of science.   A group of Black folk sued the state and won. How often does that happen?    Question Mrs. Lester how old is Darryl? Answer Darryl is 18. Question Mrs. Lester I know that you have a plane to catch but is there anything else you might want to say just to sum up your feelings about this case?     Lucille.     At the end of Judge Peckham's decision Brandon Gamble says ...   He put a ban in place.   No IQ tests are to be given to Black children to make decisions about special education in the state of California. By the time this case ended and Judge Peckham had issued that ban years had gone by. Darryl the kid who set this whole thing in motion when he was in elementary school was 20 years old now. Was not even living in the state anymore. His mom Lucille had moved the family away after things had gone so badly for him at school. And that is really the last that anyone had heard from Darryl for decades. Until Lee Romney came along. She is the reporter we spoke with from KALW. Because as she started reporting on all of this she kept wondering What happened to him?   Everyone was saying you know I have no idea. And to be honest nobody seemed terribly interested you know? And -- because everyone talks about it Larry P. is a case.   And she was like What about Larry P. the person? Which is how she ended up in that little house outside Seattle hanging out with Darryl Lester.   Everyone who works in Special-Ed in California they all talk about the Larry P. case.   Which is me.   Yeah.   So do they know me?   They do not. So -- and I do not know ...   Nobody had ever asked him -- not only not asked him about this nobody had ever really told him about it. And when I came up there and I had the ruling in my hand ...   This was the -- just the judge's ruling. It is like 130 pages long.   Wow!   But it goes ...   Wow! That was my case?   Yup!   Wow!   And he goes you know That is my case? It was just sort of like ...   Wow!   Like I did not really expect this. He and his wife were both happy to have me come up happy to hear about it.   Really? That you are here? I feel kind of honored you know?   And what actually did happen to him after the ruling?   So right after the lawsuit was filed actually his mom moved him and his family up to Tacoma Washington.   I moved here in '71.   Okay so right as soon as they file the lawsuit mom was like We are out of here.   Yup.   They had an older brother who had been in the military and he was up near Tacoma.   So when we moved here I had like a third grade reading level and I was in the eighth grade.   And then it was time for high school and ...   Pretty soon...   They said Well okay. We are gonna put you in special-ed and half-a-day program. Well what is that?   He was back in a special-ed program.   Well you get up in the morning and you are gonna go over to Safeway. Safeway the grocery store? And they say Yeah. I went to Safeway I had to be there at 30 and start work at 8. And I worked from 8 'til lunchtime.   Were they paying you?   No it was for credits!   Oh my God!   Wait that is a thing?   You never heard of that?   Eventually his stepfather complained and got him out of that program.   Even though Darryl was like terrified to just be dumped into the general population because he did not have any foundation.   They had not prepared you.   Not for them type of classes. No. Uh-huh.   But he was thrown back into general ed without any help.   None whatsoever.   And he squeaked by for a few years.   They kept moving you from grade to grade.   Yup.   Eventually graduation rolls around.   I missed my high school diploma by two credits and thought I am not gonna make it out in the real world.   After that ...   You know he moved back to Georgia for a bit and then he started partying a lot.   Oh my God. Drinking smoking just all kind of stuff.   He definitely had some substance abuse issues for years. So then it was just sort of low -- you know it was a lot of really hard physical work.   The best job I had is when I was working at Kaiser Aluminum before I got hurt.   On the job?   Mm-hmm.   Then Darryl told Lee this story that just sort of showed how this thing that happened to him when he was a kid never really let him go.   I got hurt on the job.   What happened?   I got slung into a wall. And threw my back all out of whack and everything.   And apparently he had received ...   They sent me a letter.   Like a worker's comp decision letter saying that he would be awarded benefits.   But he says he took that letter.   And I threw it in the trash. I did not know.   Because he could not read it.   You know it is kind of hard to put it into words. I have lived this long these many years lack of reading you know? There was things I needed to learn that I did not learn.   And he still struggles with this.   Sometimes I would be down here by myself.   Sometimes his wife comes downstairs and he is ...   Darryl what you crying for?   Crying.   And they say grown men do not cry. That is a lie.   And I should say Darryls life is tough but it is not all bleak. He has a daughter he is happily married.   How me and Cecilia met we grew up together. Yeah we grew up in church together.   Yeah.   That is how we know each other.   In a choir.   Our families. 25 years.   Oh yeah.   We have been together 25 years.   Long time.    You know so they both sang in this church choir and that since he -- he said he is been clean and sober about 18 years.    So I left that alone.   And so people talk about that case and here like there is this fully-dimensional human being that seems like the case does not really even get to.   My life might not be like my friends' that you know got better jobs nice homes. Not to say I do not want that you know because I do. But it just did not come my way. But I am content right now with what I have. So here today you sitting here talking to me I am happy. I will tell you over and over again I am not ashamed of who I am. I am Darryl Eugene Lester. Born 1958 December the 29th. From Marietta Georgia. And I am here still living at 59 years of age.   And the ban? The ban that the Larry P. case led to what happened to it?   It is still in place.   It is still in place?   Yeah. Yeah so this whole situation that Darryl got caught up in as a kid has completely changed. The class that he got stuck in those classes are gone. Theyre not a thing anymore. And this test that sort of shuttled him into that class is banned for Black kids.   And the judge didnt say ban it for everyone or revise the test or de-bias the test or whatever. He said just dont give it to Black kids.   Yeah exactly.   But if youre a white kid or if youre a Spanish-speaking kid or a Hispanic kid or a ESL kid you can take it?   Yeah.   Thats still in place?   Yeah. Still today.   Its like -- I hate this word because I always feel like this word just like hides all kinds of things but Im gonna say it anyways. I just kind of find that kind of problematic.   You are not the only one who feels this way.   It is racism in the school district.   Its not right. Its not right.   In the next episode of this series we are gonna return to this case and look at all the weird ways it plays out now. And well also keep wrestling with this idea of G the measuring of human intelligence with IQ tests trying to figure out what it really captures. And learn that despite all of its horrible history it was behind solving one of the biggest public health problems of the 20th century. Thats coming up in episode two.
