     All right Here's a good one. His -- this is a guy whose murder conviction overturned. But he shot and killed somebody. I mean this is violence right? It ends up not being a crime but he took somebody's life with a gun.   Hey I am Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. And we are gonna start off today with a conversation that happened in a conference room somewhere in Ohio.   Let us see. So ...   Okay. So ...   Just how I got to Cleveland?   Yeah. Maybe walk us through that part.   Comes to us from our reporter Molly Webster.   So it was like September. We were looking around for stories for something. One of our challenges like bears or bad news breaking things.   Mm-hmm.   And so I do not know if I have ever mentioned this but I am from Ohio.    Really?   Yeah I know. It is shocking. And so I thought Oh I will do -- I will pull the Ohio card right now. I am gonna look at this online news site Cleveland.com.   But there is nothing in the story that is like harm -- I mean yes it says he shot someone but he did shoot someone.   I think I saw a headline on their homepage about the right to be forgotten.   So the information about the case is preserved. It is just when you search his name it does not come up.   Wait. Time out. This is a room full of people trying to figure out if someone has the right to be forgotten?   Well I did not actually know so I just emailed the guy ...   Hello?   Hello?   ... who had written about the experiment.   This is Chris.   Chris Quinn.   I am the editor of Cleveland.com.   He is basically the head honcho.   Got it.   I started at the Plain Dealer in 1996 as a reporter.   So Chris's story is he started out at the print newspaper the Cleveland Plain Dealer. And he did -- he was a reporter.   Okay.   He did that for about five years then he moved on to become an editor.   And then in 2013 they created an entirely new newsroom that they asked me to lead.   He basically became the editor in chief of their online paper Cleveland.com.   And what we really were trying to do was to figure out what kind of content does the digital audience want?   Once he moved online it was like the audience was different the format was different. The speed at which they had to put up stories was different.   Were putting this up now.   But there was one part of the online process that kind of stuck out to him and it had to do with time and memory.   Yeah. We -- this actually it began I think it was in 2014 when I first wrote about it.   Like back in the day if you did something stupid got arrested and ended up in the paper?   If it is in the paper as it was for decades its printed in the paper.   People would read it in the morning and then they would throw it out.   And it drops out of sight. It is not easy to find. I mean there is some newspapers that -- that kept indexes that would be at the library. But even with those you would have to go to the library know there was an index look up a person's name and get to it.   And if someone really wanted to find it theyd probably have to spend hours or days just scrolling through microfiche slides to finally maybe discover that thing about you from your past. But now that everything is online it is there always and forever. So if you are going on a date it is there. If you are going for a job it is there. It just never goes away.   Its right up front forever.   So as Cleveland.com started putting up all these stories about you know people driving drunk or vandalizing property or streaking across the football field Chris started getting these emails.     Requests from people to take down stories about them.       Because they are embarrassed or it hurts their ability to get jobs.         Or their children are getting older and might find them.       We were the cause of some major suffering.     Harming people a lot and crushing them psychologically.     It didnt feel good. But we did not address it at the time. We kind of put it aside and did not act on it.   Why not?   Well I mean editors all across the country were getting these emails.   But there was a longstanding feeling that we are the first version of history and that these archives are sacrosanct and you would never change them.   Journalists like as a profession have this idea that -- that they are the first draft of history or the public record. And you just do not mess with that.   And every month I would get more of these requests from somebody saying Your story is wrecking my life. Cant you please take it down? And I would -- you know every time I would be hardline. Yeah we do not do that. But the number of these continues to increase. And -- and man when you read them these are people that are -- that are you know imploring you to help them overcome a mistake. And it just -- in the end you know we had enough of these in a row where it was okay we do not want to be the agent of suffering.   So Chris made an announcement. This was the column that I read and it said something like you know If youve had an article written about you and it was by us and you want it taken down or I do not know your name deleted or something send us an email and well consider it. I -- and I just thought who has the -- like who has a right to be forgotten or who does not have the right to be forgotten? Who is making those decisions? What are the kinds of things that they are thinking about when they are deciding who to delete and who not to delete? And so when I was talking to Chris I was asking him all of this. And for reasons I do not entirely understand he just said ...   I mean you are welcome to -- to listen in.   You know why do not you just come see for yourself?   We -- we talk it out. Just acknowledging this continues to be very much an experiment.   So that brings me into the room.   Hey Im Molly Webster. Hi. Its lovely to meet you.   So they meet about once a month. When I visited there were seven people in the room.   Hi Im Laura.   Im Molly.   Pretty standard issue conference room. There was the Special Projects Manager the Social Media Editor the Public Advocacy Manager a Crimes Editor.   We have Mike and Mark?   A former rock critic who is now the head of the culture desk.   Im Mike.   Mark. Mike.   And a sports editor.   You are ...   David.   Okay. Okay.   We all sit around a long table. Chris outlines the rules of engagement.   We are not gonna name the people as we talk about them. We will just use the numbers for the cases.   Defendant number one.   Well yeah.   And everyone has in front of them this document that is about 50 pages. It has 12 different cases outlined and each case has got the articles attached to it the statement of the person about what they want removed is it a name or a mugshot? And a personal plea for why they want it taken down.   All right?   Yeah? Yeah cool.   We ready to start?   Yes.   All right. So this is an attorney. I mean there is one sentence really about him caught up in a -- in another case. It did plea to a misdemeanor and did have it expunged. I mean this would seem to me to be a no-brainer and ...   But he is an attorney charged with obstruction of justice. He pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice.   A misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice .   Quick note. For a morass of legal and ethical reasons we are going to try to keep all the people we talk about anonymous. So you are gonna hear a number of bleeps.   A notorious case. He was a minor figure in it but the other two attorneys were ...   I would want to know. What if I was like hiring a lawyer? I would want to know that this happened.   Youd want to know that he would obstruct justice on your behalf cause it gets you off .   I think its -- that its a public service to leave his name up. So that people know. No?   I disagree only because of the paucity of information that is in this story about it.   And that is all there is.   That is it. I mean you have no context. You do not know what ...   He is pleaded guilty to something.   Yeah but -- but he is saying ...   So one of the first things that happened was that they started getting in these arguments about how much value an article had and whether or not it was serving a public good.   Thats the -- thats the use that journalists point to. We do need names. We need to put names to these arrests because its part of the public record.   This is Kelly McBride. She is an ethicist at the Poynter Institute.   I did have this experience where my kid was on a soccer team. And there was this coach who seemed really questionable to me in his behavior and the way that he acted around the kids. And you know sure enough on the mugshot site in my local hometown this guy showed up for domestic violence. And I -- you know so I went to the athletic director and I was like Hey! This guy cant be working for us. And thats the -- that is the use that journalists point to is that you should be able to find out the bad information about somebody because you might be considering employing this person around your children.   Or really employing them at all. And ...   I do get the idea ...   Back in the room    You know the whole sense of like if I am one of his customers I would probably want to know that.   There was a lot of debate. Is this thing the lawyer did bad enough that all of us need to know about it?   But he is still licensed to practice law right?   Right.   I mean ...   He did not lose his law license.   I mean there -- the bar here I mean they are pretty thorough about you know looking at this stuff and deciding whether somebody is fit to practice law you know? I mean the bar did not do anything to him.   So one of the big questions is how do we make that judgment? Should we follow the courts? You can hear them putting a lot of weight on whether or not a court has sealed or expunged a record which is basically the court making this decision to remove the case from its own record.   I mean this is sealed. We are relying on a court that said Yes you have done your time. You can have it sealed. So I -- we would need a very strong argument here not to do that. You want to make your argument stronger Laura?   I mean no I guess.   Does anybody want to make a strong argument here? All right.    A lot of head shaking.   In the end they decided that this lawyer dude had the right to be forgotten. And so they just sort of like -- whoosh whoosh -- vanished his name from the article. And that was one of the simpler ones. Like after that things definitely got tougher because some of the cases they talked about were so complicated. Like someone who killed somebody and then it was labeled self-defense.   Hmm.   And I was like well that is -- I mean it is not murder-murder but that is like still killing someone.   Yeah.   Like does that person have the right to be forgotten? And then one of the hardest cases ...   All right on the fourth one. He did have it expunged.   Was actually a cop. His record was sealed.   But you know it is a police officer. Its theft in office ...   But over the course of a few years he lied on his time sheet and walked away with thousands of dollars.   We have said on the front end of this that sex crimes violence crimes and corruption were -- were much less likely to do this. So I guess this comes down to would you view this as corruption or do you view this more as a guy who was theft in office kind of thing?   The cop in his email plea to the group he said basically Look Ive been on the force for many years Ive never had an issue. I shouldnt have done this I know that. But this was just one mistake.   You know this was not some elected official. This was not use of force. You know I mean this guy got -- this guy was skimming overtime you know? I think -- but again you know when the firefighters were having time stuff too I mean that was a big problem. So it is -- but this is one guy doing one thing. I -- like I am so back and forth on this one.   But he did not -- he did not abuse his authority as an officer. He stole from his employer. I mean this is like any other theft.   Yeah but I hold him to a higher standard for being a cop in the first place.   It was interesting. You could see people's just like opinions shift.   This was a -- this was not a momentary lapse in judgment. This went on for  years it looks like right?   Yeah.   And it is only been  years since this story ran. And so I do not know that means something to me. Like this was an ongoing thing about what he had going. He would taken the money the extra money.   And I am with Mark. Like the public trust issue here. You know this is not some you know water department guy skimming copper off the you know some job site. Like this is a police officer stealing overtime over the course of  years. I mean that is ...   A veteran cop.   A veteran as he described himself I believe. But I think that its -- yeah. I mean I guess I see that.   I do not know. I first read this and I was like Yes I think we should let him be forgotten. But now I am kind of on the other side. Like I think -- because it is not a ton of money he is not a public threat to people but because he is in a position of trust in a public position taxpayer money I think you guys are right when youre saying he should be held to a higher standard.   Well but but remember to get back to our central question. Is the value of having his name there greater than the pain it is causing him for being there?   Again and again Chris just steered the conversation back to that question which is does the value of this article up outweigh the harm it is causing someone? But the trick with that question is how do you know what information will be valuable in the future?   I mean if we put this story behind a wall and other police departments do not see it what stops him from going to be -- to get a job? If he gets it sealed and this story goes away other -- other offices might not be ...   I wonder if he lost his certification. We should look that up. We should do the research because if -- I mean we are talking about another Tamir Rice case.     Hovering over the conversation was what happened to Tamir Rice.       So in 2014 in Cleveland police officers shot and killed Tamir Rice after they saw him holding a toy gun.    I did not know this but the cop who shot and killed Tamir Rice before he worked in Cleveland he worked at another police department where he was deemed unfit to serve. And then when the Cleveland Police Department was hiring him they did not dig into his records and then the other police department did not like offer the records. And since it had never been a news story that was Google-able like no one knew about it. So he was hired.   If -- if all records of this disappear and he applies to be a cop again youre -- it would be basically our fault that he is able to do bad things.   And so in this case one of the thoughts in the room is ...   What if one of these people does something horrendous right? What if in a future year you know they go in and you know kill 17 people? Would not you want to know about their past transgressions?   I actually talked about this with Chris in one of our interviews.   I mean would not that make those past transgressions relevant again?   And he told me that when they do decide to delete someone ...   We are -- we are keeping a spreadsheet of the names that we have taken out that -- very limited access.   Wow. That feels like a crazy powerful spreadsheet.   Yeah I know. I -- I ...   Is it in a vault or something?   I am not sure. Look I keep saying this. This is an experiment and we are not -- we are not there yet.   So in the end what did they decide to do with the ...   With time sheet cop guy?   Yeah.   They did not delete him.   Oh. Wow. And was that like a unanimous or was it a like split decision?   I think -- no I actually think by the end that once Tamir Rice walked into the room you could kind of feel the -- the energy shift to the non-deletion side.   Wow.   So they just sort of like wrapped it up decided not to delete him and then it was like onto the next case. Which is a very good one. And we will get to it after the break.   Okay. Radiolab will continue in a moment.     I am Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. We are back with Molly Webs and the right to be forgotten.   Yes!   And I have a question for you.   Yes.   The Cleveland.com newsroom are they the first people to do this situation?   No no. It is happening all across the country.   Around the country newsrooms are tearing their hair out trying to figure out how to deal with this.   That is Poynter ethicist Kelly McBride again.   Because there are thousands and thousands of people who did one stupid thing and that is the thing that the internet remembers them for.   One of the things I found out was that it is a huge conversation but not a lot of people are openly talking about it. And all of these kind of quiet conversations seem to be happening now because of something that is like bubbling up in Europe.   What is bubbling up in Europe?   Well so basically what happened was in Spain when this guy Mario in 1998 he had basically gone into bankruptcy.   Mm-hmm.   At which point the local newspaper published an announcement about it. And then 10 years go by. Mario cleaned up got his money back got his life back on course. And so he reaches out to the newspaper and he was like Hey I have cleaned up my life. Can you take this bulletin down so it does not show up on the internet?   Mm-hmm.   And the newspaper says No.   Do you know why they said no?   Because I think ...   For the usual reasons?   Yeah. We published this. This is local news.   Public record.   It is part of our archives.   First draft of history.   Done.   Okay.   And then he goes to Google and he says Hey can you de-list this from your search engines? And they say no. And so long story short he actually takes Google to court gets all the way up to the European Union Court which is like the Supreme Court of the European Union. And in 2014 the judges in this European case make a decision that if something is out of date irrelevant or not accurate a person can request a search engine to take it down.   So in Europe you can petition to have things taken off the internet?   Yeah and it is ...   Wow!   It is this moment where like a new right is established. This is when you start to hear the phrase Right to be forgotten.  VIKTOR MAYER-SCH The unfortunate element of human remembering is that because our brain forgets automatically we never had to deal with deliberate forgetting.   This is Viktor.  VIKTOR MAYER-SCH Viktor Mayer-Schnberger Professor of Internet Governance Oxford University.   I called him up when I was trying to figure out what was happening in Europe.  VIKTOR MAYER-SCH We cannot deliberately forget. If I tell you please forget that my second name is Michael you will remember that. It is the exact opposite. And so the problem is we do not know how to disregard memories of our past. We do not know how to forgive if we remember. And so as we become a remembering society we become an unforgiving society.   So he is a strong proponent of policies that help us forget even just a little bit.  VIKTOR MAYER-SCH And that is the point that I wanted to make. I am not in favor of annihilating memories. I am in favor of putting them in the shoebox and stashing them in the attic. So that if you really want to make the effort to go up there you can take them down. You can read them. Pour yourself a glass of wine and go through them. But you do not stumble over them every day.   And at some level I think that is part of the thinking behind the European Union policy. Like can we just take -- take some of our stuff and put it back in the attic.   Hmm.   And pretty much everyone I spoke to here said a Mario type of case is coming. I mean basically the consensus is this is gonna start going to court in the States.   Really!   When the European Union went with a right to be forgotten you know I started to look at that thinking Is that -- we should not have a law like that here because of the First Amendment but is that something as an industry we should -- we should consider?   Chris is like We have got to do something but we do not want it to be a law because of the First Amendment. We still want editorial independence. So why do not we just figure it out on our own?   And this is like every newsroom figuring it out for themselves?   That seems to be the moment that we are in right now. You do really get the sense that is it is like on-the-fly they are figuring it out as they go. But then you think at what point do rules come into play?   Yeah.   If you do everything on a case-by-case basis by its very nature it is subjective.   All right. This is a good one. It is a college kid who got involved in .   So one of the cases that Chris and the other editors talked about while I was there was this college student who got involved in a drug operation. We are not gonna say which drug. And he was doing it with some friends and we are not gonna say how many.   And this is one of the kids asking us -- again it is going back. Its 20-. It is a college kid doing something very very stupid. But you know what are you -- I mean it is gonna dog him for the rest of his life if it stays on our site. Everybody knows about it. But this is -- this is a college kid doing something really dumb. I mean and it is bad. I mean he was enabling people to do drugs. It is  years later he is trying to get on with his life.   So the first thought you hear in the room is just Oh my God we were all idiots in college. We should take these articles down.   I did not have an issue with this one but if somebody does speak up.   But then on the other side ...   There is something to me that is different between  and you know selling pot on the side when you are in college or something and getting caught for it. Or even selling drugs -- other drugs. So it seemed to me like  years I do not know if that is long enough for me to think like let us take this down.   Like you never did anything stupid in college I guess.   Well I did but I did not . Now look I mean look I am the former rock critic right? So I am like given to like give this guy a break. But it seems to me that judging from like some of the other cases we have looked at this is fairly serious.   He wasnt one of the ones that said they had -- they were getting clean right? Like he was not saying I was under the influence of drugs at the time and -- I mean that is not an excuse. But ...   The conservation turns to okay who is he? Does he deserve to be forgotten? And to figure that out there are a ton of different questions you could ask. You know is he sober? Is he reformed? Was he sober then? How much time has passed? How much time was he doing it?   Here's the question. Are the other people in here having a difficult time getting jobs? I mean there is a lot of unknowns here you know? I mean all these other people their lives might be fine. Maybe there is another reason this guy is not getting jobs you know?   Do we know that he has not done anything since then?   Yeah he is clear. And he is seeking to get it expunged. And he is saying it is coming up in every job interview he has right? Does an employer have a right to know this? Does an employer -- and he is getting it expunged. I mean another thing we could do is say When your expungement's complete let us know and we will take it down. But it is  years later. He was in college he was 25. It was not like he was 18.   So remove the fact that this is a clean-cut kid who was going to a private college and move this scenario to the same age the same race but not in college and in some rural community ...   And at this point questions of race and class come into the room. All the editors are white. Most went to college themselves. Is that biasing them in some way?   I mean would our willingness to forgive this kid be different if the socio-economic issue ...   This is not about forgiveness. It is about the idea that on our site because we are so big when you search for somebody this is the first thing you find. And we have not set any kind of economic strata for this. We have not set a geographic strata. We are considering each case as it comes in. It is this case. Does this kid deserve to have his name removed? You know is enough time passed is -- it is not a crime of violence and corruption. I mean that is really the central question.   As you heard Chris reacted pretty abruptly to the word forgiveness being brought into the room.   I do not think we are in a position to forgive.   So I asked him about it after the meeting ended.   I think it is almost presumptuous for me to think that I can forgive these people.   But -- but I agree that is -- that is it. But in a sense you have taken on -- if we acknowledge these people and offer them respite we will help the rest of the world do that too. That to me sounds like forgiveness.   Okay. I do not -- I am not -- I do not feel like we are forgiving the seven people who asked for this relief. I feel like we are -- we are enabling them to carry on with their lives without the baggage of the mistakes they made. Because we are -- society's very judgmental. And if somebody looks them up sees that they did this. It is a big mark against them. I think what we can do is -- is kind of revert back to the way things worked before the internet the way it used to be.   Right. Well...If we think the answer to this is to find a way to unpublish everything that somehow we collectively think ought to be unpublished. That is a pipe dream.   I ran Chris's thought by Deborah Dwyer who is a doctoral student at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   School of Media and Journalism.   I was talking to her because she has been studying journalists and how they are approaching take-down requests in this whole like right to be forgotten issue. And basically what she told me is you can only delete so much.   Yeah. No we are never going to be able to eradicate our past. That -- that day that ship has sailed. But the power that we give an arrest report from 10 years ago on a minor offense that some silly child did and they are now grown up and responsible and attempting to get into law school people actually have the power to determine how important that is right? How much weight do we give that? Organizations I talk to said they were considering not covering arrests or court cases -- actual trials -- unless they could see them through their completion.   Part of this might be being better about choosing on the front end what types of stuff we want to commit to digital memory.   Mm-hmm.   But ...   Part of this is us shifting our perspectives.   Because if you can never totally forget something you have to learn how to forgive without forgetting.   Right? But we live in a world of revenge porn and mugshot extortion websites and public shaming. And so is that the type of society we want to be? Because again something that is ...   A type of society that is gonna forgive you for that thing you did 10 years ago.   Well likely not right now. But that information there is never going to be a perfect way to clean up everyone's past. That is we have got to learn to live with it. And if we can decide maybe that we ought to address it with a little bit of compassion that gives me hope.   Were not doing that one. I am looking for one of the simple ones just to delete. Here's one.   So this is just deleting like a two-sentence paragraph maybe. Or one-sentence paragraph that just says his name this guy's name. Delete.   Then I add a note at the top. And that is that.   This story was updated to remove someone's name in accordance with the Cleveland.com Right-To-Be-Forgotten policy. You stick that right at the top. Oh you put in a date.   Yeah. Make it italic and say Note. And then hit save.   View on site?   And it is gone.   All right. Well one person's gonna be really happy when he Googles his name today. Because it all just changed.   It all just changed. It will take me probably you know I will get to all of them by probably -- well the end of next week because I am gonna be out of town on beginning of the week.   Cool. That is -- I think this is where I leave you.   All right. When is your flight?   Well I am gonna stay the weekend. So ...   So what did you walk away from the whole Cleveland experience thinking?   That I was confused. I guess one of the things is that you can walk into that room you are making this decision and you do not have a lot of information to go off of. Like if you are lucky you have an email maybe a sealing order and the articles that featured the person. And at times that feels like not enough information. You just think like I want more. And then at other times you think Gosh it would be bad if we had more information because then I might just start like judging this person and it might actually get more subjective. I do not know. But there is one more chapter to the story. A while a very long while after I got back from Cleveland I got an email from Chris.   Okay.   And it said that that day they had just done another round of right-to-be-forgotten petitions and that he thought that one of the people would be interested in talking to me about what they did and why they wanted to be deleted. So at that point I called this guy.   Hello.   Hello. How are you?   Im okay. A little nervous but Im okay.   You made it. Nervous is fair.   I did. I wrestled traffic so I was a minute late.   Let me just make sure everythings settled on my end. So I have you until noon is that right? What time do you need to get back to work?   I can be here longer.   Okay.   If need be.   Okay well just roll with it then.   Let me power down my phone too.   So you know how throughout this whole episode weve been like bleeping out facts? Were gonna keep doing that with this case. Well just like hold back some information. In some instances we might change a fact.   Sure. Sure.   It is obviously a risk for this guy to be talking to us and we want to give him the chance of anonymity. But he is up for that risk.   Well you go on a journey like this as a -- as a person who really never aside from a speeding ticket really never interacted with the criminal justice system. And you -- it changes your whole way of thinking and how you approach life and how you approach each day. And so by me perhaps talking about it maybe it -- it gets people thinking about it and trying to gain understanding I guess.   So the story of this guy -- should I give him a name? Like a fake name?   Yeah. Give him a fake ...   Call him like Seth.   Seth.   Okay. So back in the like 2000s 2000-and-teens Seth was just like living a pretty solid life. He had a good job a wife two kids. And then over the course of a few weeks ...   I exposed myself to two women.   Mm-hmm.   Once in his neighborhood in front of a woman who was driving by. The cops showed up later that day but they just sort of gave him a warning.   You know nothing really happened. And until  days later when I did it again.   This time it was to another woman and well just say it was at the gym.   And cited by police and then everything started.   Hmm.   I called my wife and I -- and I met her at a local park and I told her.   He tells her whats happened.   He tells her everything?   He tells her everything. And part of what they talked about that day was something that had happened years before.   Yeah when I was 10 or 11 I was sexually abused. Now it -- I didnt think of it as abuse at the time. I felt a lot of guilt a lot of shame. I thought I was in on it. So it was probably okay. You know that is what I was thinking. And I really didnt think it had an effect on me. But it did. Again these are not excuses but I think the -- really the most damaging thing was how I was introduced to sex and how that became an issue in me not getting help for that. And again Im talking all about me but you know I really frightened two women. And Im just like -- Im just sorry. I am just so sorry.   Eventually Seth has to go down to the police station and get you know his mugshot taken and actually get charged. Like misdemeanor charges against him.   This was a couple weeks later when the police officer called and said they were actually gonna file charges. Come down to the police station. I went down. You know right away I am like Okay we got to go we got to go we got to go. And I was wearing a hoodie and had just woken up and no thought in my mind was like they are gonna take a mugshot. But they did and -- Molly if you ever get cited or ever get called to the police station you know take a shower wear something nice because it was a horrible picture. Its always there. Im just a couple keystrokes away from my mugshot from the worst picture I took the worst day of my life.   So if this had just stayed in the court system no one would have ever seen that mugshot because you know Seth just gets to this point where he is like ...   I just am guilty. I just want my -- I will plead to guilty to everything. I dont want -- I did it. I want to take responsibility for it. And Im sorry.   He pays a fine serves probation. Were told he issues some sort of statement of apology to the women gets a new therapist. But then of course in the midst of this he gets a call from a local newspaper.   Somebody had tipped them off that I had been cited for indecent exposure.   From there it was picked up by paper after paper and different like online news sites until it was all over the place.   And you think about -- you think about you know my parents are still alive. What are they gonna -- theyre gonna read this in the paper. My kids.   Yeah.   It is just a lot of shame. And its almost like you -- shame is what you deserve.   And so by the time that stuff starts rolling out he tells his kids. He ultimately loses his job.   And the whole shame thing. So when I would walk around or go to the grocery store things like that -- and Im sure it was delusional but Im like Everybodys looking at me. Theyre pointing it out. You know again so my kids my son goes off to college meets people. They Google. And you know a unique name and a hometown and there I am. So I think that thats really a big part of the damage is the family. And they dont -- they didnt do anything. They dont deserve any of that.   He said a particularly low moment was when his daughter came to him and said Youre the number one news story.   Oh wow.   You know how you can see like the top news stories for your area if you are in a search engine if youre doing like Google News or something? Apparently his story was the first one and it was his mugshot.   And a really salacious story about me.   And not that he didnt do ...   Yeah you dont want to excuse it for sure.   A -- a creepy dark kind of thing.   Totally.   But that is -- that is the heart of the question. Like how do you weigh the value of us knowing about Seth and what he did against the harm that it is doing to him and his family. You know in this moment all of us are probably making different decisions in our heads. But here's what actually happened. According to the law a year after hes done everything the court asks him to do he can apply to have his record sealed. Which he did and the judge agreed.   I think I got them finally sealed in May of this year.   And no one has access to the judge's thinking the records are sealed. But not long after that he saw that Cleveland.com was doing this right-to-be-forgotten thing and so he was like Oh that could be me. Like I could do this.   I -- I wasnt sure if Id get approved but I still had hope when I sent it. Tried to craft a good email really state my case as much as I could.   So I have the letter that Seth wrote to the right-to-be-forgotten team at Cleveland.com. And I am not gonna read the whole thing here but just to give you a few excerpts. It says Years have now passed since my mental crisis and my very public and salacious brush with the law. I am grateful for a few things. The love and support of my family guided me out of the darkness. I am here and not in a cemetery because of them. He continues I am also happy that I was able to model for my children exactly how a person should behave after making a monumental mistake. While I would do anything to turn back the clock alter my actions and spare two women from my frightening behavior I simply cannot change the past. And it goes on. I ask that you consider me and my actions for the Right-To-Be-Forgotten Initiative and that you remove my name and photos from the articles written about me. Im grateful for this consideration. Thank you.   So I got an email from Chris saying that we met and we have been -- and youve been approved. And he said something like there were mentions and theres really no way to just take out your name so were just gonna take the stories down.   Wow!   Mm-hmm.   So I talked to Chris about taking all of the articles down and he said like first thing the case is just so notorious that taking Seths name out wouldnt actually allow him to be forgotten. And so it just made more sense to delete all of the articles. The other thing is it seemed like a case that just kind of fit in to the rules that are emerging in these committee meetings. These were misdemeanors. You know it wasnt violent crime. It wasnt corruption. It wasnt a celebrity. They thought he seemed apologetic. There had been no other instances. So to them it seemed like a pretty cut and dry decision.   But I -- you know I still have -- it was not the only outlet that this stuff appeared in. So I still have a Google problem. But again like the records being sealed like every little step and every day that passes every bit of time you leave a mistake in the past. And youre one step closer to a new life a second chance something better. And this was a big milestone.   Um I have a question about the women who you exposed yourself to. And I guess ...   Thats Radiolab producer Annie McEwen. She was in on the interview with Seth. As far as the women go theyre anonymous in all the articles and the records are sealed but its their story too. And so at the end of the interview Annie asked Seth about this.   So Im just trying to put myself in their shoes. And if they wake up to somehow discover that the article about their experience was taken down do -- do you think about that from their perspective?   I have. I hope -- I hope they dont think about it honestly. I dont know how they -- how theyd think about it. I dont know. I dont know. I dont know if -- they might be upset. But I dont know. I hope -- I hope they dont think about it.   Thank you Molly.   You are welcome.   That piece was reported by Molly Webster and produced by Molly Webster and Bethel Habte.
