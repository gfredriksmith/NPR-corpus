   Okay today we are re-podcasting a show with something extra an update. This show which we did a couple of years back is called Patient Zero which sort of took a look at the origins of things not surprisingly disease but also other things too. And you know you will hear all that. But I wanted to step in and say that in the middle of the show we are gonna slip from looking back at a disease that started a way long time ago to examining a disease that you know as I speak this is happening right now. Our Senior Editor Soren Wheeler will bring you that. In the meantime here's the show.     So have we said where we are on tape yet?   Starting us off today are our producers Lynn Levy and Sean Cole.   Very pretty day to be on an abandoned island where victims of contagious disease were quarantined. And one in particular who lived here died here never believing that she was in fact sick and dangerous.   So this is a story that begins when?   It -- well actually it starts in 1906. And it does not start on the island it starts in Oyster Bay.   Oh nice neighborhood!   Very nice. And there was this one rich family on vacation there.   And their daughter get sick. She gets sick first.   This is Judy Levitt.   I am a professor emerita at the University of Wisconsin.   And she wrote a book about this story. So basically the girl the daughter has a fever. Then her sister comes down with it and then her mom and a maid.   About six out of eleven in the family gets sick.   And with this disease the fever's just the first part of it.   Both diarrhea or constipation are reported. So it can go either way I guess.   What is it?   Typhoid.   Hmm.   And they could not figure out what had caused the disease so they called in this sanitary engineer named George Soper.   With the Public Health Department. He was a go-to guy for outbreaks like this. Back then the Department of Public Health was thinking you know you would get sick because of something dirty near you.   In the well or in the pipes.   Yeah. So he looks into all of that.   Did a whole test on the house and the water and everything. Could not find anything and so ...   He starts talking the family.   And he started quizzing them all and they ...   Eventually he builds up this whole picture of several outbreaks going back years.               All these cases. And they all had one thing in common.   What?   Each of these families had employed the same cook.   Really?   Really?   Which is funny because when you cook food you kill the bacteria in the food.   Yeah!   So it could not be the cook then.   But this cook ...   Her most famous dish was Peach Melba which is ice cream and fresh peaches.   Fresh peaches. Raw fruit.   It was a perfect medium.   And the cook's name was Mary Mallon.   Mary Mallon. Wait a second Sean Cole.   Typhoid ...   Typhoid Mary is who we are talking about.   Oh so we know this story.   No you do not know this story.   What do you mean?   Everybody thinks they know this story. I thought I knew this story. And then when I looked into it I realized I did not know the first thing about it. And when you look into the details they tell us some very difficult things about who we were and who we still are in a lot of ways. It is all in the details all of the juice and problem.   Like the peach juice.   The peach juice.   Just like the peach juice. Still dealing with ...   Wait! I am Robert Krulwich.      Go ahead. Go ahead do your part!   I am Jad Abumrad.   This is Radiolab. And in this hour ...   A series of stories that all hew to that delicious story archetype we call ...   Patient Zero. The first cause.   We will try to trace ideas and trends and massive social traumas like pandemics back to that one person.   Or one critter. Or the other way you could call it is called the but for. If you did not have this thing but for this thing you would not have the rest of the story.   I like the but for.   The but for.   But meanwhile ...   Back to the peaches.   So George Soper's like I have got to find this woman. And when he finds her ...   She is in New York City working for another family.     This is from an article Soper wrote called The Curious Case of Typhoid Mary.     So he goes to the house walks into the kitchen. Sees this woman 5'6 blond hair blue eyes.     Irish immigrant 36 years old.     And he says Mary Mallon I think you are causing disease in people and I want samples of your urine feces and blood.     Good afternoon!   And she says ...   What are you accusing me of being sick?   Playing the role of Mary is Columbia Public Health Professor David Rosner.   How dare you? I am not a sick person.   What does she do?   She chases him out of the building.   With a fork in her hand.   A serving fork.   A serving fork?   Yeah.     But did she have typhoid? I mean did she outwardly have typhoid?   Well that is the thing.   She never had any symptoms. She felt perfectly healthy.   She was actually the first documented case in North America of a healthy carrier which is to say someone who has the disease and is contagious but never actually feels ...   The symptoms?   The symptoms. So in one weird way Soper's thrilled. Like he is only read about this. And then here she is in front of him. But think of how all of this must have sounded to Mary. I mean some guy from outer space comes into your kitchen and says You are diseased and you are hurting people. She must have thought ...   What? I feel fine. I am living a moral life. I am not a vagrant. I am employed. I am a good solid citizen. You know you would be crazed too would not you? Even today.   You would -- you would probably grab your knife yeah.   Yeah you would grab your knife.   Well does he have any evidence though that she is spreading the disease?   Not yet. That is why he needs her poop.   Ah.   So he goes back finds her at a rooming house. She kicks him out swears at him.   She apparently had quite a temper.   And then the health department sends in this female doctor ...   By the name of S. Josephine Baker. Maybe she could ask for blood feces and urine a little more gently than ...   I just do not know how you ask for that gently.   But she tries. And when it does not work she comes back a little bit later with cops.   And they come to the house and Mary Mallon when she realizes what is happening disappears.   What do you mean disappears? She just vanishes?   Just completely vanishes. They end up searching the entire place and they cannot find her. Finally I think they are about to leave when one of them spots ...   ... her skirt coming outside of a door.   It is a little piece of calico kind of stuck in a doorway.   They open the door and there she is.   And so they drag her out and she comes out kicking and screaming and ...   ... screaming and kicking.   It takes all of them to drag her out.   Protesting.   They get her in the ambulance and Josephine Baker sits on her. According to her sits on her.   And Baker later said ...   Something like it was like being in a cage with an angry lion.   So they take her down to the hospital.   They tested her feces and urine and they found that yes she was in fact a carrier of live typhoid bacilli.   It is a weird Island. I spent a while on here.   So they isolate her and they ultimately move her from Manhattan to North Brother Island.   And there she is.   We went there to just to try to get our heads around what she must have thought.   What was the island like?   Man everything is completely overgrown.   It was really creepy.   Creepy because it was in such dissolution?   Yeah. Yeah.   Just be careful where you step.   On one end there are all of these medical former medical buildings including a giant hospital where they isolated tuberculosis patients. So big brick stately building. And then on the other side of the island there is smaller wooden buildings that are crushed.   This may be where her cottage is.   Where her cottage would be if it was still standing but it is not standing anymore.   Well it was one room. One room. It had a kitchen. It had a I guess a sleeping area and a sitting area. It probably was not so bad if you did not have to stay there. You know any place is -- that you are not free to leave becomes like a prison.   So we are marching around and then Lynn says to me Hey look at the view. And ...   Holy moly! It is right there.   That is when it really hit me.   If this is where her cabin was then one window of it looked exactly onto Manhattan.   She could have seen where she used to live.   You can see the traffic on the streets.   This was like the most horrible seaside vacation.   Almost the whole time they had her incarcerated they took feces three times a week which is you know it is not pleasant to have to do that. And sometimes she was negative and sometimes she was positive.   Wait what?   So that is -- that is another thing that they were figuring out at the time. So she was probably an intermittent carrier.   What does that mean?   The disease is always in her but sometimes she excretes it and sometimes she does not.   Oh that must have been confusing for her.   When I first came here I was so nervous and almost prostrated with grief and trouble. My eyes began to twitch.   This is from a letter that Mary wrote from the island.   I have in fact been a peep show for everybody.   But if you keep reading it and in fact it is addressed to a lawyer it is clear that she was fighting this. And she had been sending her own feces samples herself to a private lab in Manhattan. And each one of those was negative.   Really?   The tuberculosis man would say 'There she is the kidnapped woman.'   Yeah that is poison ivy.   She sues the city and loses. Still there are of all these questions as to whether any of this is legal. I mean even George Soper the guy who hunted her down said it was contrary to the Constitution of the United States to hold her under the circumstance.   And how long was she on this island for?   Three years.   Wow!   And then what changed was a new health commissioner took over.   And so he says it is just not right that we keep a healthy woman locked up like this. She was not dangerous to anybody if she did not cook.   He lets her go.   He lets her go?   Yeah back to Manhattan. But he makes her promise.   She did promise. She signed an affidavit ...   Saying she will never cook again. And she was released. They gave -- they set her up with a job as a laundress and they went Here you go Mary. And then you know they kept track of her for a while.   Hmm.   And then at a certain point they kind of stopped keeping track of her.         Dun dun dun dun! So how many years will go by?   Five.   Five.   What happens next?   There is an outbreak of typhoid.   Oh boy.   Where?   Where?   At a maternity hospital.   Oh you are kidding!   Oh wow!   Josephine Baker who sat on her in the ambulance before she says that she goes and pays a visit and walks into the kitchen. And she says the first person that she encountered was Typhoid Mary Mallon. George Soper did some legwork on where Mary had been and it turned out she had worked at a restaurant two hotels an inn and a sanatorium as well as the hospital. And at least according to his account two of the people that she made sick during those couple years were children.     So then they put her back on North Brother Island back in her bungalow. And there she sits.     Absolutely. She is broke -- broke her promise.   Yeah I totally agree.   She made a deal and she did not keep the deal.   But the thing is is that at the time she was sent back to the island there were hundreds of other healthy carriers identified all over New York and some of them were cooks.   What?   Really?   Mostly men by the way. And ...   And they were cooking?   Well they were barred from cooking but not all of them always listened. And yet Mary was the only one who they isolated in this way.   Why? Why only her?   I think it was more about making people feel safe than actually making them safe.   Oh look out for this stair. It is all crumbled.   She was what we needed at the time.   We are in the hospital where the tuberculosis patients were quarantined.   This was towards the end of Lynn and my visit to the island.   Yeah these must be the wards.   Definitely.   Yeah.   So when was she here?   This is where they brought her after she had a stroke. And this is where she was for the last six years of her life.   Did she die in here?   Yeah. Yeah                   Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert. Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today ...   It is patient zero. That is our subject.   Yeah and this next story whew!   It is so huge.   It is the ultimate patient zero story really.   Many of us have lived through this. It was -- it is as recent an event -- it is such a recent event that it still hurts and it still bleeds.   Yeah.   And in it somewhere is a -- literally the -- the patient that is called Zero. So this is ...   Yeah. A lot of people are gonna help us tell the story but starting us off is science writer Radiolab regular Carl Zimmer.   So in 1981 doctors for the first time described ...     A syndrome.     The young men in Los Angeles ...   Were dying.           Of course this is the part we all know. How from those first few cases in LA AIDS became one of the deadliest pandemics the world has ever seen.     But back at the beginning there was a story that I have not been able to shake for the last 30 years. And it is a story that I want to re-imagine right now.   Right after news of this syndrome started to break ...   That is science writer David Quammen who along with Carl will be one of our guides.   Epidemiologists were trying to figure out where ...     And they were thinking like Well maybe it is a sexually-transmitted disease.   So the CDC launches a study.   Of a group of about 30 patients.   Gay men.   In New York Los Angeles and San Francisco to see who had had sexual contact with whom.   How do you -- is that just a series of interviews with people?   Yeah. Please name all the people that you -- that you have slept with.   The CDC eventually releases the results of this survey in the form of a diagram.   Like a network drawing with circles representing patients and then lines representing sexual contact.   And each patient each little circle was numbered.   New York seven. Los Angeles 12.   So you did not know who was who but you could tell immediately when you look at this thing that of all the 30 or so circles there was one circle that was special. It had lines coming out in every direction.   Seven or eight emanating from him.   Like the hub of a wheel except all the spokes on this wheel connected to other wheels which then shot out and connected to other wheels fanning outward. And at the center of it all was that one little circle numbered ...   Zero. Number zero.   As far as we know that was the first time that you ever get the term patient zero.     This is from a 60 Minutes special in 1988. That year a reporter named Randy Shilts had written a book called And The Band Played On that for the first time revealed the identity of patient zero.         Gatan Dugas.     A few minutes later in the report Shilts comes on to describe a guy ...     This sexual athlete who would fly from one hot spot to the next because of his job having sex with literally thousands of men.   And as he knew he was dying at least according to Randy Shilts he became somewhat sinister and malicious. He would sleep with a male partner at a bathhouse in San Francisco or somewhere else. And then when the light came up according to Randy Shilts he would say I have got gay cancer.         This is Dr. Selma Dritz. She was part of that CDC study.     Really a chilling moment.   And pretty much from that moment on Gatan Dugas ...   He just took on this -- this aura as single-handedly causing an epidemic in the United States.   Now I do not know about you but I first bumped into this story in the movie version of And The Band Played On.     That is an actor playing Gatan Dugas in the movie. Now when I first saw that AIDS had already infected two and a half million people. And to think that it could all go back to this one guy just seemed unreal.   It was a -- it was a very potent story. There is no doubt. And -- and he gave HIV to a lot of people there is no question about that. But what we do know is that he was not patient zero.   He was not patient zero.   No.   He was not the beginning point.   He was not.   Not even close.   Huh.   So here's the question that got me started on this story. Okay so the gay steward that was the movie stuck in my head. But what is the real movie? What movie can we make about the beginning of the AIDS epidemic? Because when you have got something so vast that according to some estimates will have killed 60 million people by the end of the decade you need a beginning. You need some way of explaining how this disaster happened. And how it might happen again.   And how exactly do we know that Gatan Dugas was not patient zero?   Well there are a couple reasons we know it. So -- so one thing that people started to do ...   Scientists.   ... was to -- they went started going back and looking at people who had died.   People who died mysteriously ...   ... of AIDS-like things.   In the past.   Might some of them have been early cases?   And they started finding a lot.       And so for a while you had all these new patient zeros.     But the real definitive blow to this whole patient zero nonsense came by actually looking at the virus itself.   In 1984 same year that Gatan Dugas died scientists isolate the virus.   HIV.   Which is really just a little string of genetic code that gets into your body and into your cells and uses your cells to make copies of itself. But here's the thing.   When it replicates within a single patient it copies itself imprecisely. It mutates quickly. It changes a lot.   As the virus duplicates itself inside a person the dupes often have little copying errors in them little mutations. And it turns out those errors? They happen at a predictable rate. You can kind of almost predict how many you are gonna see in a year or five years. And so the amount of changes that you see out there the diversity really of the viruses in the AIDS population well that becomes really good information. And so a group of scientists began to look at ...   The amount of diversity among HIV patients in the US.   And other parts of the world.   And the more diversity the longer the virus has been around.   Right. Right.   And they could use that kind of like a clock. If you have a virus here and a virus there ...   You could measure how different they are and you would know that it would take a certain amount of time for them to get that different. And to make a long story short ...   The picture they get is ...   That AIDS entered the United States ...   Around 1966.   At a time when Gatan Dugas was still a virginal adolescent.   From there scientists were able to trace the virus back to Haiti and from Haiti back to Africa.   It is been there the longest. It is had the longest time to become diverse to mutate to evolve. So if you want to really -- if you want to get to the real patient zero as it were the most interesting stuff come -- actually comes from Africa. So one way to try to figure out its origins there is to go looking for the virus.   Yep. And that takes us back to ZR 59 and DRC 60. Can we talk about them?   Sure.   What?   These are the two earliest known HIV-positive human specimens.   And this is where for me at least the story gets way bigger than I imagined. Now the first sample ...   ZR 59.   Came to light in the late-'90s. Somehow scientists unearthed a very old tube of blood from hospital in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo. And when they tested it ...   It had HIV. This had been taken from a Bantu man in 1959.   1959!   Yeah. Nobody knows his name. Nobody even knows I think what he died of. And that was the only one for a number of years.   That was our one glimpse into the kind of deep history of HIV.   But then along comes that guy Michael Worobey. He is an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. And a few years ago Michael went back to Kinshasa and found a second HIV sample. He actually found the virus lurking in a tiny bit of human tissue that was preserved in paraffin wax.   It is kind of like Han Solo in the Star Wars movie when he is kind of frozen in that carbonite or whatever that stuff is.   In this new sample it was from the same town Kinshasa as the first. And also more importantly from the same time.   1960. And with the two of them then you can kind of go back in time.   Like we described before you can measure the differences between the samples calculate how long it would take for those samples to get that different. And in the end you can use these two samples to wind the clock all the way back to the virus that started it all. And it turned out ...   The most recent common ancestor of those two specimens ...   Goes back to ...   ... to about 1908.   1908. That is when it started in human beings.   What? 1908? Is that what he said?   Well roughly.   Give or take a margin of error.   Early 1900s.   So around 1908 give or take something happened.   That is right. That moment is the spillover.   Spillover.   Spillover's the term that scientists use to describe the moment when a virus in one species passes into another species.   You know new diseases in humans tend to pop up from animals. So people said Okay flu comes from birds. Where does HIV come from? To get at that answer you have to look beyond human beings. You have to look at other viruses that are like HIV.   So the search was on.     Turns out right about the time that the HIV virus was discovered ...     Some researchers found a virus like it in macaque monkeys.     In fact it was so similar that they called it ...   SIV.   Simian immunodeficiency virus.   Yes and that is where the origin quest started.   This is Beatrice Hahn.   I am a professor of medicine and microbiology at the University of Pennsylvania.   And so after they found it in macaques what happened?   It took a couple of years ...   But eventually she says they found SIV ...   In still another primate species the sooty mangabey.   And then in a few more.   The African green monkeys mandrills.   Pretty soon it was all over the place.   There are now I think 40 different species of African monkeys known to have their own version of SIV.   So then the question was which one of these monkeys or primates passed it to us?   Then unexpectedly ...   A researcher named Martine ...   Martine Peters.   At the center in Gabon.   Decided to test her chimps.   Two orphan chimpanzees.   And bingo. She found a very very close match.   A virus that was the closest relative of HIV-1.   So ...   Everybody said Well you know ...   It was a chimp.   It was a chimp. Okay.   Yeah it came from a chimp.   Yes.   But then the question was well which chips or rather where?   Where exactly?   So ...   Beatrice Hahn and her colleagues started looking at chimps that came from different parts of Western Central Africa.   Now getting blood samples from chimps in the wild is pretty much ...   It just is not feasible.   You know because in the wild they hide the moment they see us.   So you get stuck with fecal samples.   Poop.   Yes poop.   There is lots of DNA in there.   And viruses.   So they would just go to where the chimpanzees would sleep at night and they would just you know collect some poop.   Bring it back to the lab and Beatrice would analyze all the viruses.   Over 90 different wild communities.   From every part of central Africa.   Over 7000 different fecal samples.   And slowly they were able to piece together ...   Which communities were infected and which ones had the closest to HIV-1. That is when it hit us for the first time.   What exactly hit you?   The geographic origin of these chimps.   In 2006 her and her colleagues published that the human AIDS virus comes from a group of chimps a very specific group that live in a very specific place.   This little corner of southeastern Cameroon.   Between the Boumba River the Ngoko River and the Sangha River.   These chimps were essentially penned in between these three rivers.   It is an area probably only of a hundred square miles. Not much more than that.   So when we are looking at what humans have and we are looking at what all of those chimps in Africa have the most perfect match is this little territory up there in Cameroon?   Yeah.   There is no other virus that is any closer. So that is that.   So can you reconstruct the spillover and the who that it spilled over into as best -- you know as best as we understand it?   You can hypothesize. And the best hypothesis is the cut hunter hypothesis.   The cut hunter?   The C-U-T hunter?   That is right. A hunter who gets cut.   And what can we say about this guy? I mean is he -- what do we know about him?   If we had to guess? If we had to guess that human was probably a Bantu man living very near the forest or in the forest in southeastern Cameroon. He was hunting. Maybe he had a bow and arrow maybe he had a spear and he kills a chimpanzee. Bingo here's a big pile of meat. And he starts to butcher it. He is cutting open the chest cavity. He is pulling out organs and he cuts himself. And he gets blood-to-blood contact. Chimpanzee blood against his blood. What happens is that the virus in the chimpanzee blood found itself in an environment that was unexpected that was alien to it but was not too much different from the biochemical environment it had been in chimpanzee blood. It could function. And that is the moment. That is the moment it begins. That human is patient zero.   But why then? Why 1908? I mean presumably people have been hunting chimps for a really long time. Why would not this guy be patient seven million?   That is another of the big questions. People certainly in central Africa have been eating monkeys for thousands of years.   I mean David says there is really no way to know but this could have just been the right virus.   Maybe this particular virus evolved in a way that made it more transmissible in humans.   Or maybe it just got lucky to come along at precisely the right time.   What you are looking at ...   This is Carl again.   ... is a time when this part of Africa was being heavily colonized. The French and the Belgians were building train systems. And populations were on the move. Kinshasa which was then Leopoldville it was exploding. It was huge.   The cities were attracting people from the boonies in those days ...   So by 1908 all the virus has to do is get from that tiny village where the cut hunter lived to one of the new cities.   That happens almost certainly by river. I was stirred by the work of Beatrice Hahn and Mike Worobey to see what this scenario looked like on the ground. So I went to southeastern Cameroon and I chartered a little boat about a 30-foot wooden boat with an outboard motor.   And he traced the path of the virus.   We went down the Ngoko River and we stopped at a few villages. There are a couple little villages there one of which has a market where you can buy monkey meat and crocodile meat.   And he says it was not hard to imagine how it all might have went down. Perhaps the cut hunter gave the virus to a woman who then passed it on to a fisherman.   Fellow that I called the voyager.   Who then got in the boat as David did and carried it down the river.   The Sangha River which is -- the Ngoko is a tributary of the Sangha. The Sangha becomes a bigger river 200 meters wide which then flows to the Congo River the big river.   And into the city.   And I imagined him sliding into Brazzaville around 1920. The first HIV-positive man to arrive in an urban center where there is a much greater density of humans where there are prostitutes a greater fluidity of social and sexual interactions. And that seems to have been the place from which the disease went global.   So that is how it happened?   We could take it back even farther actually.   What do you mean?   Because if you want to make a movie about the start of it well this is not the start. Because we got it from chimps right?   Right.   So you could ask Who was chimp zero? What do we know about chimp zero right?   Yeah. I mean everything comes from somewhere. And again by molecular work scientists have been able to determine that the chimp virus is actually ...   It actually comes from ...   Two monkey viruses.   Two different monkeys from two completely different species.   What? Would they have encountered each other somewhere? Had a fight?   They probably encountered each other in the stomach of a chimp.   Meaning what?   Well from the perspective of a chimpanzee monkeys they look tasty.   This is Nathan Wolfe.   Professor in human biology at Stanford University.   And he says to fully understand this part of the patient -- or rather chimp zero narrative you have to grasp how it is that chimps hunt. And this is something he witnessed.   In the Kibale National Forest in -- in southwestern Uganda.   He described to us watching three male chimps converge on a tree full of colobus monkeys which are these very small black and white monkeys.   And one individual managed to grab two juveniles and then the three individuals all met up and ...   Began to eat the monkey while it was still alive.   The chimpanzee was going after an organ you know that -- that obviously was a tasty morsel that he was going after. And -- and the monkey was screaming bloody murder.   It is quite disturbing to watch he says.   But one of the things that struck me at that moment was the depth of contact between the blood and body fluids of this monkey and the chimpanzee.   The chimps are literally covered in blood. They have blood on their face in their eyes. And from the virus's perspective this is spillover heaven. Okay. So the following is the closest that we can get to a zero point in this entire narrative. We do not know where it happened.   And we do not know exactly the time. Say some hundreds of thousands of years ago.   From the molecular clock we know it was less than a million years. That is all we know. But whenever it was chimp zero was hunting and it comes upon a monkey called a red-capped mangabey.   The red-capped mangabey. This is a larger primate.   And these are tree-dwelling little -- little guys?   Tree-dwelling.   Little bit of red fur on their heads.   Yes.   Chimp zero spots one of these monkeys eats it. And in the process he catches a red-capped mangabey version of the AIDS virus. Next sometime after that first kill weeks months we do not know maybe it was the same day chimp zero comes across another monkey. And this monkey was called a spot-nosed guenon.   Yes.   It is got a spot on its nose I assume.   There you go.   Very small.   One of the tiniest monkeys of all of the old world monkeys.   And chimp zero eats that monkey and gets a spot-nosed guenon version of the AIDS virus or the SIV virus inside it.   So you have got the red-capped mangabey and you have got the spot-nosed guenons. You have got a guenon and a mangabey.   Two completely different kinds of SIV viruses inside the same chimp. Now under normal circumstances according to Nathan both of these SIV viruses would go nowhere because ...   When one of these viruses makes the jump ...   They go from a place they have adapted to and that they know to a completely foreign landscape.   Like a human being dropped off on Mars maybe without a spacesuit. I mean they basically are entering a completely alien habitat. The cells do not look the same. The environment is different.   And the chimp's immune system would normally kill them.   But then once in a blue moon ...   Something crazy happens. These two viruses will end up inside the same cell in the same chimp at the same time.   Literally there is a single cell simultaneously infected with both viruses.   So suppose on one side of the cell you have got the mangabey virus and on the other side of the same cell you have got the spot-nosed guenon virus.   And what happens is literally ...   Inside the cell ...   ... you have an enzyme. It is called the polymerase enzyme. It is copying genetic information of the viruses.   This is what viruses do. They hijack these enzymes to make copies of themselves. Now here's the problem.   These -- these enzymes they are not necessarily that sticky.   And while they are in the process of copying one virus every once in a while they will accidentally fall off mid-copy and go thwack!   And latch on ...   ... to the second virus and just keep on copying. And so what it ends up spitting out is a hybrid. Like that. Now this new mosaic probably will not go anywhere because 99.999999 percent of the time when these hybrids happen ...   It is a dead end.   The chimp's immune system is pretty sophisticated. It has evolved defenses against these viruses and it will destroy them. But again once in a blue moon ...   So this is a blue moon after a blue moon after a blue moon to really get this. Finally you get one particular mosaic virus between the mangabey and the guenon.   That through sheer random luck works. It landed on the exact right combination of genes that allowed it to evade the chimp's immune system.   I mean one of the amazing things to think about is how many -- how many hopeful monsters you had to have in order to get that one that actually survived.   Probably trillions. But then ...   Boom.   Suddenly in a flash from these two viruses that can barely survive in the chimp you get a new virus.   A little bit mangabey a little bit guenon.   That can not only survive in the chimp but can thrive. In fact for this baby virus the chimp is the perfect host.   And that was the virus that ended up spreading jumping over to humans and has been this massive and incredibly dramatic sort of tear in the fabric of humanity.   Let me add another parentheses. There are essentially 12 major groups of the HIV virus.   What David means is it 12 different kinds of HIV viruses have spilled over 12 different times.   Eight of them came from monkeys three of them came from chimps and one came from gorillas.   Wow.   And of those 12 only one of them is responsible for the global pandemic.   There are 12 kinds!   12 times that we know about. It is probably happened dozens and dozens more times that we do not know about. So the spillover is not a highly improbable event.   These sorts of viruses they are constantly pinging at us. They are pinging it us and pinging it us. We see it happening all the time.   You see it happening?   All the time.   Nathan has set up a series of monitoring stations.   In places like central Africa.   And he and his colleagues have been tracking what he calls the viral chatter in the people who hunt these primates.   We collected specimens from the animals that they were hunting.   They compared that to blood samples from the hunters themselves.   And guess what? We found a whole range of new retro viruses that were moving over into these hunters.   For example he is been tracking something called the Simian foamy virus which is ...   From the same family as HIV.   And he has seen it hop from an individual gorilla to an individual human who killed that gorilla.   Yeah. These are almost certainly what we call primary transmission events.   Oh so you really are looking at the potential beginning of something but who knows what?   Yes. So if you want a patient zero really clear patient zero it is some of these individuals that have been infected with these viruses. And the real question is how do we stop patient zeros? How do we avoid patient ...   Patient one and patient two.   Exactly.   So Nathan is developing a series of tools like ...   Digital surveillance. I mean some of these places -- I work in some places in Democratic Republic of Congo you basically have to fly in to get there.   No roads. Often no electricity. But ...   Many of these places they still have cellphone towers.   So Nathan has begun to track cellphone call patterns in these communities. So if he sees a blip of many calls to a medical center within a short period of time?   Okay boom! Now we got to investigate that. We continue to find viruses that are completely novel and we are looking to determine if these are -- if these are the next HIV.   Because think about it he says HIV landed in humans in 1908 but we did not know about it until 1981.   We had decades of time when this was a virus before it spread globally.   What if we would been looking for it?   A lot of people to thank for this segment. Thanks to Nathan Wolfe.   For being Nathan.   And he has an awesome new book called The Viral Storm.   Also thank you to Carl Zimmer whose book on viruses is called A Planet of Viruses. And thank you also to him and to Michael Worobey. Their interview was recorded on a podcast from Meet the Scientists which you can find at microworld.org.   And thanks to David Quammen who is got a book called Spillover coming out very soon which is all about diseases crossing over from animals to us.   And also to Beatrice Hahn at the University of Pennsylvania.   And to Katie Slocum from the University of York for letting us use her recordings of chimpanzees.   Hey this is Soren Wheeler Senior Editor and Producer at Radiolab with a quick update. So David Quammen's book Spillover has -- it is been out for a couple years now. And as we all know we are actually now at this moment facing the tragic consequences of another spillover. This time it is the Ebola virus. And we found ourselves wondering just how far it is going to spill.   Okay? All right. Okay.   So Robert and I called up David Quammen again. He had actually just reprinted with updates the chapter about Ebola from his book.   Yeah. Ebola the natural and human history of a deadly virus.   First of all how old is this disease? Anyone have any idea?   Well as a human disease as far as we know it dates to 1976. There was this outbreak of a strange disease at the Yambuku Mission in northern Zaire.   318 cases. 280 people die.   And then there was another one in Sudan at about the same time.   This time 151 people die and then it just disappears.   Hiding in the forest.   Without a trace until in 1994 thousands of miles away in Gabon another outbreak.   Yes. That is -- that is the history since 1976. It disappears for -- for two or three years at a time. Sometimes it disappears for a decade and then it spills over and causes a human outbreak.   Well if -- if something is in the closet and is going to jump out at you then the natural question to ask is where is the closet? Like where is it hiding?   Well the main suspects are bats. We do not know that for sure because nobody has ever isolated live Ebola virus from an African bat.   Have they tried? Have they looked in lots and lots of bats?   Yeah they have looked in lots -- they have looked in all kinds of animals. They have looked in insects. They have looked in snakes. They have looked in forest antelopes. They have looked in monkeys. They looked in plants. Literally hundreds of different species they looked in. Found zero traces of live Ebola virus.   So we really do not know where it is coming from or where it might come from next.   No. No.   Can I just ask you just to describe the Ebola virus? It is -- it is apparently -- viruses are generally teeny. Is this a teeny teeny teeny one?   Yes. Yeah. It is a teeny virus. It belongs to a family they call the filoviruses. Filo as in thread. It is a -- it is a spaghetti-shaped virus. Its genome is carried on just one strand of the -- the genetic material RNA.   And while those genes have let the virus live happily for hundreds of thousands even millions of years in bats or whatever animal it lives in when it gets into humans ...   Ebola burns too hot.   It makes so many copies of itself so quickly that it just destroys the body and the person is usually dead within a few weeks which David says is actually bad for the virus because Ebola can only pass through direct contact with bodily fluids and because it kills so quickly it does not have a lot of opportunities to get into the next person.   So the scientists have a term for that too. They call -- at least they used to call us a dead-end host. How is that for a phrase? We are the dead-end host of Ebola. And that means that when Ebola gets into us it has no great future. It is either gonna burn out and come to an end or we are gonna stop it. But right now we do not seem like a dead-end host.   Yeah. I am wondering like you know if we have -- if since we have started noticing in 1976 a burst here a burst there why -- why now this? Why is it ...   Yeah. That is the big question for Ebola 2014. This time we have got a very different situation. It is gotten out of control. Why has it gotten out of control? Well partly because we recognized it late. It began back in December of 2013 with a two-year-old boy in southeastern Guinea. At least he is the first known case at this point. He died. His mother died about a week later. His sister died his grandmother died other people in the village died. This went on from early December until the middle of March.   By then it had spread from these small villages into larger cities in part David says because well previous outbreaks had been in very remote places it now found itself in a more densely-populated area.   The capital cities in these small West African countries are not very many miles away from the villages of the countryside. Then the virus got into these poor neighborhoods like West Point where people were living together in -- in crowded slum-like neighborhoods. And -- and when their loved ones got sick people took care of them. And when their loved ones died people cleaned the bodies and -- and touched the bodies and said goodbye to them. So the infection spread. And of course those -- those dense poor neighborhoods in the capital cities are not that far from the international airports. So suddenly you have got the opportunity for the -- almost the first time for Ebola to get on an airplane.   So if you -- have people changed the way they think about Ebola because I mean is there a mood shift there?   There is a little bit of a mood shift but the -- the experts the scientists the public health officials are still saying this is not that kind of virus. It still is as far as we know a virus that is only transmissible by direct contact with bodily fluids. It should be easy to stop easy to contain.   But according to David the thing that some scientists are worried about is that as Ebola gets into more and more people and makes more and more copies of itself it is changing.   Yes every time it replicates there is a chance of a mistake.   There is a chance that the genes for the next virus will come out just a little bit different. It will mutate.   Most mutations are either insignificant or they do damage. But occasionally there can be a mutation that might possibly help the virus.   Can we track these things? Like can we -- can we take a person who is got sick of Ebola in Sudan and compare it to a person who is sick of Ebola in the Congo and compare that to a person who is sick of Ebola in Niger or in wherever. Can we do that and see whether it is changing?   Yes. And it has been done. Steven Guyer and his colleagues published a paper in Science in early September which involved doing exactly that.   And one of the things they found says David is that since this virus has been in us during this outbreak it is been changing twice as fast as it has previously when it is living in it is animal hiding place.   Yeah. So it has had more opportunities to replicate in more different people. It has not just been in 300 people. It is been in 9000 people now.   That -- is that the key word? Is that the more opportunities you have to have a good mutation from your point of view that this is suddenly -- this disease has gotten an enormous number of opportunities?   That is the operative word yeah.   Are there boundaries around that? I mean like do we have any sense of how big a leap it would be for this to suddenly be transmissible in the air?   Yeah. We know that for this to spread through the air there are very special machinery you know grappling hooks proteins on the outside of a virus that help it catch hold of particular cells and enter them. And Ebola does not have the right grappling hooks to lay hold of cells in the respiratory tract and get in them and then come bursting out of them and be carried outward on your breath. To get to that point would require a number of mutations each of which is infinitesimally unlikely. And when you ...   Is that a mutation that it would be startling like a what to a what?   Yeah some people have been saying that it would be like mutations that allowed a giraffe to fly. But there are other scenarios that are a little more probable. For instance it might mutate and adapt in such a way that it kills fewer people or kills them more slowly and leaves people infectious for a longer period of time. Maybe people are walking around for three or four weeks with an occasional vomiting episode but they are not dying. That would potentially give Ebola a greater opportunity to spread among more people.   What -- this is not a fair question to ask you but what should we be doing?   I think the most important thing we should be doing is not letting the public health versus civil liberties issues in the US distract us from West Africa. As the case count gets -- we have talked about this. As the case count gets higher it has more opportunities to mutate and therefore more opportunities to adapt. So we need to end this outbreak in West Africa before this virus learns too much about us.   Thanks again to David Quammen. His book is Ebola The Natural and Human History of A Deadly Virus. We will be back in just a moment.     Hey you want to know about my one of my proudest moments of being a dad?   Yeah.   Happened this morning.   Yeah?   So you know how Emil's a little bit of an introvert right?   Mm-hmm.   And we are sort of worried whether he socializes enough. Well we were taking him to daycare and we are -- he is taking his shoes off and there is this little boy who is only there two days a week and he is not adjusting well. And every time his mother drops him off she has to literally pry him off her and he is wailing and you know? So Emil sits down on this little seat to take his shoes off. The mother of this kid puts this little boy next to Emil and he is just crying. Wah! He is distraught. So then what happens is Emil turns to this little boy looks at him sticks out his hand and says High-five.      High-five. Out of nowhere.   That is amazing. Yeah because it is like they are out in their own society you know?   Okay so let us do the introductions. I am Jad.   I am Robert.   This is Radiolab. We are calling this show ...   Patient Zero.   Yeah. And for this next segment no more patients.   No more diseases.   Exactly.   Let us focus instead on invention. On the people who bring new ideas into the world.   Yeah the zeros behind the ideas. That does not quite sound right. You know what I mean.   Yeah.   And that guy you just heard?   Hi. My name is Jon Mooallem. I am a contributing writer at the New York Times Magazine.   He is got his own high-five story to tell though it is not about his daughter.   We have -- I think we have kids around the same age.   Or her first high-five. It is actually about the first high-five ever.   Yeah.   Ever?   Yeah.   See one morning a few years ago ...   2007 or 2008.   Jon turned on his computer opened up his email and found ...   A press release about the -- the true undisputed inventor of the high-five coming you know out finally.   Who was the press release from?   National High-Five Day which is a kind of a joke holiday that was invented by a group of high school friends I think.   And they told the story?   They told the story of Lamont Sleets. College basketball player at Murray State in Kentucky.   And the story in the press release went something like this. Sleets's father fought in ...   Vietnam. as part of the 1st Battalion 5th Infantry which was nicknamed The Five. And they used to greet each other by holding up their hand and saying Five as a kind of prideful thing. And when Lamont was younger they would all sort of hang out at the house in Kentucky and he could not keep all their names straight. So when they would walk in the door and they would go Five he would just sort of smack their hand and he would go Hi Five.   Oh like Hi like Hello five.   Hello Five. Yeah. Hi comma Five. You know he has small hands he likes to put them up against the big hands of the Five guys. And it was years later that he started playing college basketball at Murray State and started high-fiving all his teammates. He really never stopped high-fiving it was just something he did. But when he went around playing away games other teams picked it up and it sort of spread out. So he was sort of both the inventor of the high-five and the kind of Johnny Appleseed of the high-five at the same time.   And within a few weeks of Jon getting this press release ...   The story was everywhere.   Went kind of viral.   It wound up sort of all over the internet. There were some local newspapers who you know picked it up. You know Murray State suddenly became very proud of the fact that they were the home of the high-five. It became sort of part of the institutional lore in the athletic department there.   And then you read this and you thought what?   I thought how sad.   How sad? Why how sad?   Because I knew the story of Glenn Burke.   Turns out Jon had already been poking around into this question of who invented the high-five and he had stumbled on this photograph.   You know maybe I do not have it.   Black and white picture.   Oh yeah. Here we go.   Two baseball players facing each other. Afros huge smiles and their hands are in the air right about to connect.   Which one of these is Glenn Burke?   So Burke's -- Burke's the guy in the warm-up jacket. I think he is even got his hat on backwards.   Glenn Burke was a center fielder for the LA Dodgers in the '70s. Big guy.   He says he had 17-inch biceps. So I will take his -- I will take his word for that.   The other guy in the picture is Dusty Baker. He is an outfielder. But you can tell in the picture just from the way that Glenn is sort of throwing his whole body forward that he is the one initiating the gesture.   I mean this is a guy who was you know the soul of the Dodgers clubhouse.   He just had that type of charisma.   This is Lutha Burke Davis Glenn's sister.   With Glenn it was like he would always be on the stage. I often said he should have been a comedian.   He was always dancing around in the -- in the clubhouse. He used to do Richard Pryor stand-up routines just from memory.   He just genuinely loved people.   So much so she says that in the year that picture was taken the Dodgers made him their sort of public face of the team.   He was their Ambassador of Goodwill.   He is the guy they would send out to all the press events.   You know like meet the youngsters or ...   That sort of thing.   Here's the story about this picture.   What was the date?   October 5th poetically enough 1977.   It is the playoffs. Dodgers versus the Phillies. Game four. Bases are loaded.   Dusty Baker ...   Steps to the plate ...   And grand slam.   Crowd goes nuts.   Baker does his victory lap.   And just as he is ...   You know rounding third coming to the plate.   Burke comes racing out of the dugout ...   And he is got his arm really high up and Baker ...   Sees him instinctively raises his arm and before you know it ...   Burke and Baker smack hands.   Bam! There it was.   The sportscasters that would you know announcing the game said they had never seen that done in sports before.   And from there on the Dodgers started high-fiving and everyone else started high-fiving.   The high-five ...   Became a thing.   Mm-hmm.   And it all began with that one moment.   The platonic high-five right there.   Unfortunately that moment ...   That was actually both the beginning and also almost the end of Burke's career.   It is not that he was not good. He was actually really good even in his rookie season.   He was being talked about as the next Willie Mays by the Dodgers organization.   But ...   He was gay. And he tried to keep that a secret while he was playing. Dusty Baker actually had kept trying to set him up with his wife's cousins and Burke never want -- never liked any of them. And Baker's completely confused because he knew you know these were these were really good-looking women apparently. So there were rumors circulating and the rumors reached the front office of the LA Dodgers. And -- and one day Burke was called in by management and they offered him 75000 to get married.   What?   75000.   To get married?   Huh.   What is this like the mob or something?   Well exactly. I mean they did not regularly offer their players money to get -- to get married. And Burke's response apparently was -- he said I suppose you mean to a woman.      Shortly after that the Dodgers traded him to the Oakland A's for a player who everyone acknowledged was completely inferior.   That was confusing for us and I know it had to be confusing for him.   It was shocking to everyone. No one understood why he was traded.   And you think it was because he was gay?   Yeah. Yeah.   You know baseball is the all-American sport.   Yeah.   But you know at least he was still gonna be able to play ball. Or at least he thought.   He ends up in Oakland. Does not get very much playing time.   And when he did get on the field it was not very pleasant.   He used to get heckled a lot you know from people in the bleachers and ...   And even worse according to a couple of different people his coach ...   Billy Martin.   Would often introduce Glenn Burke this way.   This is Glenn Burke the faggot.   Really?   Yeah.   And so Glenn Burke retires.   Wow and he was only like 26 or something right?   Yes. He was young.   Within a year of his rookie season. Just walks away.   God that is like a aborted career.   Exactly. From there he ends up in the Castro District in San Francisco which is the big gay neighborhood.   And things go okay for a while.   But then one day when he is crossing the street ...   Three teenaged girls in their mother's car ...   Come barreling down the road.   And they hit him and broke his leg in three places.   Oh man.   And that kind of ended everything when that happened.   He starts taking painkillers. One thing leads to another.   He gets hooked on crack. Cannot hold a job. He goes broke.   Ends up living ...   On the street.   And in 1994 Burke is diagnosed with -- with HIV or AIDS. I guess AIDS at that point.   He ended up coming to live with me. A lot of times he did not sleep well at night and we would sit up and talk. Put on music. And I danced and he would move his arms around because he was in the bed. He was bedridden.   And so you took care of him 'til he died?   Yeah.   And Glenn Burke died in 1995.   But what he is left with at this point is he is left with the original high-five right? That is his claim.   Yes. Yes. That defined him to some people at least at the end. And he -- and he believed it. A reporter had asked him you know if it was true about the high-five and he said Yeah think about the feeling you get when you give someone the high-five. I had that feeling before everybody else did.   Huh. So what did you do when you got this press release?   So I called National High-Five Day because I wanted to talk to Lamont Sleets. Even though I was sad it seemed like okay here's another person's prideful accomplishment. Let us get his story.   Hello? Hello?   Eventually ...   Hey there we go.   He gets this guy on the phone.   My name is Greg Harrell-Edge.   Greg is one of the founders and he and Jon gets talking. And Jon asks him the sensible first question.   Is the Lamont Sleets story true?   He figured it was but he thought he should at least ask. He is a reporter.   And there was a pause and he said No.   Frankly we have been waiting for someone to ask. We thought no one would ever ask.   It is not true.   This is something that we had made up. We wanted to see if the media would -- would run with it.   They made the whole thing up.   They made the whole thing up and then they just went to go cast their protagonist.   So we sat down. We picked Murray State. That is just kind of a great-sounding school. It pops up in the NCAA tournament every few years.   And they came across this guy Lamont Sleets.   Why him?   Well it was pretty close to random.   They then told me they had received an email from Lamont Sleets's wife.   Absolutely. His wife emailed us and said some of the details that you have are flat out wrong.   That implies that some of the things you have said are right though.   But Lamont thinks he probably did invent the high-five.   Wait wait wait wait wait. What about Glenn?   I was kind of like hmm kind of a bit blown away you know?   Yeah you know here was this guy who is proud of this and these guys just kind of stripped it away from him?   Do you feel a little guilty? That I mean like okay it is a high-five. It is kind of a silly thing. On the other hand this guy's life the way he died. Do you feel like you robbed him?   We do feel -- we do feel -- we wish that we had done things slightly differently in -- in putting together this sort of collegiate prank. But we did not really know of Glenn Burke at that time.   Greg says they had not heard of the Glenn Burke story when they pulled this prank and now that they know it they really feel bad. In fact they are now organizing a charity event they are calling ...   The National High-Five-Athon.   Which will raise money for charity including one chosen by Glenn Burke's sister Lutha.   I am very proud. Any time I see somebody do a high-five it just really makes me happy.   And that seemed like a good end to the story.   But ...   No. Because then Jon told us that ...   If you really honestly want to get to the bottom of who invented the high-five? I mean we did not think we wanted to but now there were in it what the hell. Well you have got to go beyond Glenn Burke's story.   I have wanted you to believe that he was hero at this point right? So maybe I should tell you a little bit about Derek Smith right?   Even though Glenn Burke died believing that the high-five was his legacy at more or less the same moment that he invented it a guy named Derek Smith a basketball player for the Louisville Cardinals was at practice ...   And a guy named Wiley Brown went up to Derek Smith and was going to give him just a ordinary low-five and Derek Smith looked him in the eye. This is what Wiley Brown told me. Derek Smith looked him in the eye and said No. Up high. That year's Louisville team they were -- they were known as the Doctors of Dunk. You know they are a high-flying team. They played above the rim.   And Jon says when Louisville played in the 1980 NCAA finals ...   I have not seen it but apparently the broadcaster referred actually to the high-five handshake.     He felt compelled to explain it to America.   Wow and did -- at the moment that Derek Smith did it did an asteroid fall on his head or something?   Well in 1996 I believe. In the '90s he had an undiagnosed heart condition and he just died all of a sudden on a cruise ship.   What?   Yes and he said explicitly to Wiley Brown This is something I am gonna be remembered for. You know our kids and our grandkids are gonna talk about this. And in fact their kids and grandkids do talk about it.   And they are probably very proud. But ...   Hello it is Kathy.   Then we ran into this one.   Fire away.   This is Kathy Gregory. She coached women's volleyball in the 1960s years before Glenn Burke and Derek Smith. And she says with her girls ...   Everyone did it. All the time. So I do believe that it was volleyball that first started it.   And interestingly she says they would high-five more when a player screwed up.   Yes. No no. It is not just about celebration.   Because really when do you need a high-five?   Of course it is more when you are down.   Yeah it makes people so happy.   So women's volleyball. There you go.   Because then our producer Lynn Levy also discovered that in the movie Breathless in 1955 at exactly one hour 18 minutes into the film you will see two Frenchmen do a very distinct haute cinq.     Right there!   Is not this all like an indication to you that it -- it is maybe -- it is one of those things that probably was there at the dawn of man?   Because it like gives pleasure?   Yeah it is just like a ...   Like from an evolutionary point of view?   No I do not think so. I think -- I think this has the feeling of something that was born. I mean who in this room wants Glenn Burke to be the original guy?   Raise your hand.   Me.   Me.   Me.   Yeah.   It is the better story.   So look at what is happening here. Every time we look for the original of anything be it a disease a contagion a gesture we find more than one. So what do you do in this situation?   I think you know what you do is you just choose. You say which one is the better story. Let us just go with the best high-five. Forget the first. The best.   And I think we can do that. Lets just call it Glenn Burke.   Glenn Burke invented the high-five.   Done.   All right. High-five. Hive-five.            -30-
