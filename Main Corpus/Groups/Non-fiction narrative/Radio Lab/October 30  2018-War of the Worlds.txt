 Hey Im Jad Abumrad.  Im Robert Krulwich.  This is Radiolab.  And today were um were celebrating a multiple set of anniversaries because it was 80 years ago-80 years ago that Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater decided to allow Martians to invade the state of New Jersey.  Hmm.  Its one of the most famous broadcasts in broadcast history because it freaked people out.  Yes and then uh merely 10 years ago we decided to take another look at this broadcast which has gotten very complicated and layered and disputed in some ways over time.  Were now celebrating our tenth. Theyre celebrating their eightieth so along with Orson Welles who Im afraid couldnt be here tonight.  . May he rest in peace.  Yes. We would like to present our homage to-I guess to microbes.  Yeah.  To the little earthlings that saved the planet.  Right so in honor of the microbes in honor of War of the Worlds which broadcast 80 years ago today-tonight here is our take on War of the Worlds.   October 30 1938. On that night the United States experienced a kind of mass hysteria that we had never seen before and the reason-which today sounds almost comical-was a radio play. y Theater Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater on the Air in the War of the Worlds.  Around 12 million people were listening most got the joke. It was Halloween after all but if you consider that about 1 out of every 12 people didnt the joke thats what surveys found afterwards. About out of every 12 people who heard the broadcast thought it was true and that some percentage of that 1 million people ran out of their homes towels over their faces clutching children breaking limbs. Well that constitutes a major freakout. And in this-our first ever live hour of Radiolab here at St. Paul Minnesota Fitzgerald Theater we ask why? Why did people panic? And of course well ask the big questions which is can it happen again? Im Jad Abumrad. Thank you all for coming and where is my co host? Krulwich?  So let me-let me just say at the outset Im just a tiny bit puzzled why?  Before you do can you just tell everyone who you are?  Oh I am-didnt you just say? Im Robert Krulwich is my name and with all due respect I mean if we had any number of things we couldve done in the hour. Couldve done sex lives of watermelons something interesting about chrysanthemums I dont know why choose a Martian invasion in a radio show from 1938? Old old old.  Okay well I guess its a valid question you ask. Truth is I actually only discovered the War of the Worlds recently in 2001 actually not long after that day in 2001 and it just really struck me and it wasnt so much that the broadcast had a kind-of-end-of-the-worldness that we were all feeling in real life at that moment but it was more just the way that the story unfolded step by step by step and how-in the broadcast you feel like you were lost inside of a newscast.  Which is not unlike what is was like on September-  Yeah we were all you know glued to the TV in real life grasping at these pieces of news trying to figure out what was going on and that was very much-I think what they were trying to create in the broadcast but now many years later what Im really left with is a question.  What?  Well if I were alive in 1939 in front of the radio and I heard those sounds what would I have thought? Would I have believed it? I mean I dont know. What about you?  I dont really know I dont really know.  Okay well lets do something. Lets actually go back to 1938 and see if we can figure out how these sounds landed on peoples ears and what information they had in their heads and I need your help with this.    Okay how would I help with that?  Yeah you-I want you to go over to that seat right there. Thats-were going to call that seat 1938.  Oh all right. 1938.  Okay now just-lets all just imagine there you are on your easy chair and youre maybe drinking a cream soda. Lets tune the dial.  Okay.   Okay Ive got something on the dial here. y Theater Good evening ladies and gentlemen from the Meridian Room in the Park Plaza Hotel in New York City we bring you the music of Raymond Rocello and his orchestra.  Who is Roc-? Marge you know a Raymond Rocello? y Theater  Raymond Rocello leads off with La Campasita  Now you dont know that theres no such person as Raymond Rocello and that its just a record in a CBS studio but it sounds professional enough so you sit back you relax. But then y Theater Ladies and gentlemen we interrupt our program of dance music to bring you a special bulletin from the Intercontinental Radio News. At 20 minutes before 8 central time Professor Farrell  of the Mt. Jennings  Observatory reports observing several explosions of incandescent gas occurring at regular intervals at the planet Mars. The spectroscope indicates the gas to be hydrogen and moving toward the Earth with enormous velocity. We now return you to the music of Raymond Rocello playing for you in the Meridian Room of the Park Plaza Hotel situated in downtown New York.  So at this point you think-  Im thinking explosions on Mars hydrogen gas moving towards Earth. How it could be so bad if I still get to listen to the fabulous notes of the lovely Raymond Roc-Rocello?  And he does continue to play for another minute 34 seconds. But then it happens again. y Theater Following on the news given in our bulletin a moment ago the government meteorological bureau has requested   Now before we ahead any further-before we go any further let me ask a really basic question here I mean were dealing with a play a radio play.   Yeah.  Why would Orson Welles and his posse of troubadours start their play this way?  The original H.G. Wells story was written in 1898 so it was really an old book at the time and there is no reporter character in the book by the way. Does everybody know this War of the Worlds story? Or most people do? The story is basically this. Little green creatures from Mars with thirst or something have to leave their planet and they come to Earth. Theyre not very nice uh people. They invade they destroy quite a number of us and in the end they get killed by little viruses. Our smallest inhabitants of our planet bite them and destroy them and its science fiction of course but in 1938 most kids knew this story. It was a very popular so I dont see why-  Right and in fact let me bring in a clip from Orson Welles producer at the time John Houseman   Uh Orson and I chose it. We decided that the time had come we should be doing a science fiction show and so we tried a few that werent very easy to do-  And just a few days before they had to be on the air with their next installment John Houseman pulls that book off the shelf and shows it to O.W and says hey what about this? And Orson Welles says this? You want me to do this?  He had trouble in one sense?  No he said it was dull he said it was boring. It was something that happened 50 years ago. Everybody knows it didnt happen. So who the hell cared?  Right.   If were going to make people care about this old story weve got to update it. Not 1898. 1938. And it just so happened that one month prior something had happened that forever changed well the world and the news. ROBERT   What was that?  Well begin with this man.    Hitler was threatening Europe first Austria then Czechoslovakia World War II was right around the corner and CBS sent a team of guys to cover this story among them Edward R. Murrow.  Columbia  continues its expensive coverage of the European crisis.  And in September Murrow and his producers did something with the news that was kind of novel. They broke in. st We interview this program of music by Harry James and his orchestra to bring you a bulletin just received in the WOR newsroom.  Now this had happened before but never quite like this with live reports eyewitness accounts and never quite so much.  st We interrupt this broadcast to bring you this important bulletin from the United Press.  In just one month these bulletins become so numerous- st We interrupt our program to bring a special broadcast.  That bulletins were practically interrupting bulletins. st We interrupt our program to bring a special broadcast. newscast We interrupt our program to bring a special broadcast of the United Press. newscast  We interrupt our program to take you to the NBC newsroom newscast Here is a special bulletin. newscast From the NBC newsroom.  So after weeks and weeks of hearing these constant interruptions its easy to understand why this play-  y Theater Ladies and Gentlemen following on the news given in our bulletin a moment ago-  Didnt sound like a play. y Theater The government meteorological bureau has requested the large observatories of the country to keep an astronomical watch on any further disturbances occurring on the planet Mars. We have arranged an interview with the noted astronomer Professor Pierson  who will give us his views on this event. In a few moments we will return you take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton New Jersey. We return you until then to the music of Raymond Rocello and his orchestra.   I dont if I need any more Raymond Rocello but I need to know a little bit more about this uh Martian thing.  Isnt it interesting how slowly it starts?   And by the way what time you got on your uh your pocket watch there?  Uh the pocket watch says 04.  All right 04. Tell me when it gets to 05.  To what?  05.  To 05?  05.  And now.  This is my favorite minute in understanding one of the greatest media hoaxes of all time because the thing thats interesting is that at this moment in October of 1938 our-Orson Welles in the Mercury Theater of the Air were not that popular. They had a tiny tiny slice of the audience. And so not too many people were listening certainly not at the beginning from 8 oclock to 04 and so not too many people heard this very important introduction. y Theater The Columbia Broadcasting System and affiliated stations present the War of the Worlds by H.G Wells.  Whoa wait why didnt they hear that?  Well cause at that very same moment the majority of people listening were tuned into this. st The makers of the Chase  Sanborn coffee you know is fresh presents the Chase and Sanborn hour. ROBERT KRUl Ah the Chase  Sanborn hour now that-that was good. That was Ed Bergen  it had the puppet-  Thats right.  Charlie McCarthy who-who-who liked girls-  Thats right it was the most popular show at the time ran opposite the Mercury Theater on the Air had ten times the audience but at 05 the host Don Ameche introduces a not so popular singer newcast And its the rousing rip-roaring song of the vagabonds from the Vagabond king.   No no no no.  And just at that moment thousands-hundreds-we dont know how many listeners started to dial surf   Where they landed on the Mercury Theater on the Air already in progress where they stayed put.  y Theater We are ready now to take you to the Princeton Observatory at Princeton-  Because by then a strange meteor had landed. y Theater Where Carl Phillips our commentator will interview   Professor Pearson famous astronomer. ps Professor may I begin our questions? n At any time Mr. Phillips. ps Professor youre quite convinced as a scientist that living intelligence as we know it does not exist on Mars? n Id say the chances against it are a 1000 to one ps And yet how do you account for these gas eruptions occurring on the surface of the planet at regular intervals? n Mr. Phillips I cannot account for it.  ps Just a moment ladies and gentlemen.  Now weve had four interruptions. At this point you call your whole family into the room.  Marge! Meteors on-meteors on Mars Marge. Meteors-what? Meteors on Mars.  And just as you are utterly confused along comes the expert. You know people surveyed afterwards said that I didnt believe this thing. I thought it was all baloney until I heard that government official guy or the Princeton professor and this script is chock-full of believable experts. y Theater Dr. Gray of the Natural History Museum Professor Inverskollvers  of the California Astronomical Society General Montgomery Smith Captain Lansing of the Single  Corps.  Maybe subconsciously that had an effect to convince people that something was in fact happening a feeling furthered a moment later when the Professor and a reporter called Phillips go live to that field in Grover Mills New Jersey where that meteorite-or whatever it is-has landed. n The metal casing is definitely extraterrestrial uh not found on this Earth.  of the Earths atmosphere usually tears holes in a meteorite this thing is smooth and-you can see its- ps Somethings happening. Ladies and gentlemen this is terrific. This end of the thing is beginning to flake off. The top is beginning to rotate like a screw and the thing must be hollow.  ps Ladies and Gentlemen this is the most terrifying thing Ive- Ive ever witnessed. Someone-someone is crawling-something I can see coming out of the black holes illuminous discs. And the eyes there might be a face might be-good heavens something wiggling out of the shadow like a gray snake. The mouth is kind of V-shaped with saliva dripping from it rimless lips-  I hate rimless lips actually.  As do I. Now before we get too far into this scene let me play you a-another clip. burg newscast The thing is gliding toward us like some great feather no doubt-  Recognize this?  No.  Lets listen to a little bit more. burg newscast looking down burst into flames get this Charlie get this and its  oh get out of the way please. Its burning-bursting into flames and-and its  oh the humanity and the passengers.  This is tape of the Hindenburg crash still fresh in peoples minds it happened one year before the broadcast. Before going on the air that night actor Frank Reddick who played that reporter Carl Phillips in the field he went to the library dug up this old tape or not so old and played it to himself. burg newscast Oh the humanity. And all the passengers.  Over and over. burg newscast Oh the humanity. And all the passengers. Oh the humanity. And all the passengers.  To get himself in that right frame of mind for that now-famous attack scene in that field in New Jersey. ps Those creatures-know what that means-anything  wait a minute somethings happening. Some shape is rising out of the pit. I can make out a small beam of light against the mirror. Its a- flames in the mirror-a bunch of men head on. Oh I can tell you the flames  the whole field surrounded by the woods and barns automobiles spraying everywhere coming this way now about 20 yards to my right.  The transmission cuts off. 12 million people have just heard slithery green aliens eviscerate policemen farmers and reporters followed by nothing. y Theater Ladies and gentlemen due to circumstances beyond our control we are unable to continue the broadcast from Grover Mills. Evidently theres some difficulty with our field transmission. However we will return to that point at the earliest opportunity.  And when they do return what you learn is that that grounded flying saucer that just zapped all those men has now stood up its grown legs. Its as tall as a tree and it is marching  through the countryside stomping everything in its path and then we are taken to field reports live battle scenes between militia and pods but before we do let me play one more clip. This one is real. newscast If you live in one of the areas mentioned and you have a child of school age and wish to have him evacuated you should send him to school tomorrow Friday with hand luggage containing the childs gas mask a change of underclothing-  This is Edward R. Murrow reporting from London-same time period-just to give you a sense of how scary it was to be alive at this moment in time. Kids in England were being told to take gas masks to school.   All of which would have made the following dramatized battle scenes y Theater We take you now to the field headquarters of the state militia near Grover Mills New Jersey.  All the more real. y Theater 31 meters 37 degrees. Fire!   Here the New Jersey militia fire on a fleet of Martian pods y Theater 24 meters.  To no avail. y Theater Fire!  Their shells bounce right off. And the Martians-in retaliation-release a cloud of poisonous gas which slowly overtake the soldiers . y Theater 15 meters.  Ladies and Gentlemen I have a grave announcement to make. Incredible as it may seem both the observations of science and the evidence of our eyes lead to the inescapable assumption that those strange beings that landed in the Jersey farmland tonight are a vanguard from an invading army from the planet Mars. The battle which took place tonight at Grover Mills has ended in one of the most stop-and-defeats suffered by an army in modern times. 7000 men armed with rifles and machine guns pitted against the single fighting machine of the invaders from Mars. 120 known survivors. Just a moment please Ladies and Gentlemen. Another bulletin from Langenfield  Virginia. The monsters now in control of the middle section of New Jersey and has effectively cut the state through its center. Highways to the north south and west are clogged with frantic human traffic. Police and army reserves are unable to control the mad flight. Communication lines are down from Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean. Railroad tracks are torn and discontinued. Marshal law prevails throughout New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania. Another bulletin fighting planes report enemy machines increasing speed north taking over houses. This time we take you to Washington citizens of the nation Secretary of the Interior. I shall not try to conceal the gravity of has handed methe situationcylinders are falling all over the country. This is the end now. No more defenses.  y Theater Everything wiped out .  We dont know exactly how many people panicked that night. Heres what we do know. The Trenton police department got 2000 calls in under 2 hours. The New York Times switchboard received 875 calls alone from people wanting to know where theyd be safer. On the roof? Or in the gas raid shelter. In the cellar?  Were lucky we do have transcripts of what happened on the other side of radios that night thanks to a Princeton sociologist who went out and conducted a series of interviews after the broadcast and whats amazing is effective that broadcast was. Some listeners said they actually felt like they were choking. Others reported to police that they saw with their own eyes as they looked at the Manhattan skyline and they saw a thin veil of smoke from the battle over the city. Some said they saw Martian machines high-stepping their way down the Palisades splash splash splash uh and many people-when they called operators or police-didnt say oh my god were being invaded by Martians oh my god were being invaded by Germans. Here are some of the literal transcriptions. This is what real people actually said. All right everybody ready?  ACTOR 1  I knew it was some Germans trying to gas us all but when the announcer kept on calling them people from Mars I just thought he was ignorant. ACTOR 2  I immediately called up the Maplewood Police and asked if there was anything wrong? They answered we know as much as you do. Keep your radio tuned in and follow the announcers advice. ACTOR 3  I called to my husband Dan why dont you get dressed? You dont want to die in your working clothes? ACTOR 4  I looked in the ice box and saw some chicken left from Sunday dinner that I was saving for Monday night dinner. I said to my nephew we may as well eat this chicken. We wont be here in the morning.   y Theater This is Orson Welles ladies and gentlemen out of character to assure that the War of the Worlds has no further significance than the holiday offering it intended to be. We annihilated the world before your very ears and utterly destroyed the CBS. You will be relieved I hope to learn that we didnt mean it. And that both institutions are open for business.  That was Orson Welles concluding the War of the Worlds broadcast with those words. Basically ha ha it was a joke. Gotcha. But it was only after he and his producer John Houseman left and read the papers the next day that they understood just how much trouble they had caused.  Well it was very disagreeable because of-for at least a couple of hours-we believed we were mass murderers.  Extremely surprised to learn that a story which has become familiar to children through the medium of comic strips and-  This is Welles in the press conference that following day.  Many succeeding novels and adventure stories shouldve had such an immediate and profound effect on radio listeners.  So immediate and so profound that the FCC Commissioner at the time George Henry Payne labeled the Mercury Theater on the Air-get this-terrorists.   Radio terrorists.  But there is one thing we must not overlook all this took place in 1938. In a less sophisticated yesteryear that did not know the Atom bomb guided missiles and rockets that shortly may fly to the moon.  Edward R. Murrow in 1957. Was he correct when he said that? Were we really so unsophisticated in 1938? I mean so different from now?  Well lets see huh.   We interrupt this broadcast for some breaking news uh this just in. It seems we may have gotten a few things wrong when we uh performed that show many years ago. Most notably just now when I said that the FCC Commissioner in 1938 called Orson Welles the radio terrorists. In his statement he certainly suggests that but if you read it it seems like he was actually referring to a statement he made a year earlier where he was calling radio producers who terrorized children and he doesnt actually name Orson Welles by name. I just botched that my apologies. And we have this guy to thank for bringing it to our attention.  Michael Socolow and Im an associate professor of journalism and communication at the University of Maine.  And uh Michael Socolow also makes an interesting argument that the panic may not have been as large as we made it sound for example uh we state the 12 million people were listening on the night which is a widely quoted number and it comes from polling done six weeks after the War of the Worlds first aired. Socolow suspects that the actual number of listeners was way smaller and theres no way to know for sure but he trusts a poll conducted that night.  That night when the broadcast was on 5000 Americans were surveyed by the C.E Hooper Company.  Uh huh.  The ratings survey company. Why are we bothering with a survey done six weeks later where the newspaper tells everybody that there was this giant panic? Why dont we look at the surveys that night? And the survey that was done 12 hours later by CBS the following morning?  What do the two surveys immediately after say?  The C.E Hooper ratings survey found 98 percent of the respondents were not listening to Orson Welles or War of the Worlds. They were listening to the Chase and Sanborn hour or their radios were off or they were listening to another program. Of the two percent that they found that were listening to War of the Worlds not a single respondent thought it was a news broadcast.  Socolow strongly suggests that the panic was actually trumped up by the newspapers who were trying to piss on this new medium called radio that was taking away their you know audience.  Exactly. Here was the opportunity and radio-the radio industry and the newspaper industry had been battling for years. Throughout that decade the entire newspaper industry had been losing money political prestige and other things to the radio industry you know some of their best employees. And so they were waiting for a way to really to prove to advertisers and to federal regulators you know they had the first amendment they understood responsibility-these are the newspaper managers. These radio guys were conflating advertising with programming they were frightening their viewers they acting irresponsibly. And remember this is a month after Munich when radio proved that news really works on the radio. Well one month after radio news you know comes of age suddenly theyre conflating news accounts with fiction and theyre acting irresponsibly and theyre terrorizing the public and so the newspaper industry had the perfect thing to hang their critique of radio on.  Huh interesting.  That is interesting. So all those-all those eye witness accounts about the panic and I thought it was this and I packed my bags and whatever whatever and all these sort of reports of people miscarrying do you feel like thats all in memory embellished or how do you explain that stuff?  Let me give you-let me give you an analogy okay if you were to ask 100 Americans today did you see a plane fly into the World Trade Center on September 11th I think you would get an extremely high percentage of people say they saw that plane fly in. But thats because its part of our national visual memory. Its really a trauma and its-its the kind of that hysteria and panic were talking about. Its that moment in time in our relationship to the media okay?  Hmm.  But if you were to actually find out whose TVs were on live at 48 in the morning that day and who was actually watching there would be a discrepancy in that number. Now am I saying all those people are lying? All those people are confused? No what Im saying is that the relationship of memory to the media is extremely complex.  Complex indeed. And we thank Michael Socolow for checking our facts. And if you believe as he does that the 1938 panic was-well didnt happen or wasnt as bad as it sounds that actually makes what we talked about next in our live broadcast even more puzzling.  Well be right back with Radiolab live.         This is Radiolab Im Jad Abumrad.  Im Robert Krulwich.  Were in St. Paul Minnesota in the Fitzgerald Theater. Our subject today is the War of the Worlds broadcast originally on October 30 1938.  Okay now Im going to ask the house for a show of hand do you think that somebody else could imagine the broadcast-using the exact same script more or less also with Martians also invading also interrupting the musical things same deal. After all the publicity for the 1939 broadcast could you do it twice show of hands please? Ah some of you dont think so. Go-ah. Look if we-you-you-if there wasnt another one of these what would we be doing for the next 40 minutes?  Well-  So-  Those of you whove raised your hands-Id say its about 75 percent of you-you are correct. Because it has happened again and I want to tell you a story-an amazing story really. An underreported story of a War of the Worlds reenactment happened in the mountains of Quito Ecuador 1949. We were really luck we had a reporter Tony Fields who happened to be traveling there. We asked him to do a couple of interviews and he brought back some tape and he played it for me. All right Tony set the scene for me 1949 Quito. Wheres Quito?  Quito is the capital of Ecuador. Quito is in the middle of the mountains in the Andes mountains.   Hmm.  And-  Small town big town?  Quito now is a big city. At the time it was a pretty small city. Um the word that everybody I spoke to used to describe the way that Quito was in 1949-  Mm hmm.  Was tranquilo.  Tranquile.  Muy tranquila.  Ciudad tranquila.  Like tranquil?  Exactly. It is what is sounds like and Radio Quito  was the most popular radio station.   Everybody listened to it.  So those are your basic ingredients. You got a small town population 250000. You have one major radio station which also happened to be in the same building as the one major newspaper El Comercio. And the leader of the radio station-the guy who ran it-a devious fellow by the name of Leonardo Paez. One day someone shows up with a script for Orson Welles-not H.G Wells-Orson Welles version of War of the Worlds gives it to Leonardo Paez he reads it says brilliant. Weve got to do this here in Quito  They insert local place names you know so instead of the Martians landing in New Jersey they would land in Cotocollao which is on the outskirts of Quito they write in parts for government officials the Minister of the Interior the mayor of Quito.  Are these actors or real government-  These would be actors  Doing impressions.  Doing impressions thats right.  Whoa.  Not only that. Paez got his bosses at the newspaper El Comercio to agree to run little articles in the newspaper in the two days leading up to the broadcast reporting that strange objects had been seen in the skies over Quito.   Wow. So he set out to screw with people basically I mean he was planting paranoia.  It really seems like he wanted people to believe what they were hearing that night.   Okay so Saturday February 12 1949 the day of the broadcast. All day long listeners hear an announcement. newscast Buenas noches senoras y senores  That theres going to be a special performance by the Duo Benitez Valencia  Benitez Valencia?  Yeah Benitez Valencia at the time were one of the most popular musical acts in town newscast en Radio Quito.  8 oclock roll around Benito Valencia launches into their performance. They play a few songs  z Valencia   Then suddenly theres an interruption   Wait what was that?  Well it turns out that Leonardo Paez-in addition to the other tricks he had up his sleeve-he had a sound effects guy in the corner that was    creating this sound.  Like one of Garrison Keillors guys-kind-of-thing?  Thats right.   Tom Keith everyone!    Eventually the music stops and Leonardo Paez comes on the air and says   Please dear listeners excuse the technical difficulties there seems to be some sort of atmospheric conditions in interfering with the Radio Quito signal but you are listening to Radio Quito brought to you by you know such and such and now back to Benitez Valencia. Benitez Valencia.   So we hear another couple songs and then theres another interruption. Atencion Atencion.  Thats Leonardo Paez again and this time-this time its a news flash.  So now were on script basically.  Thats right thats right. They send Paez to report from the scene. Cotocollao.  And Paez is doing a play-by-play and what is this thing oh my god the tops unscrewing here come the tentacles.  newscast   And here come the heat rays newscast   Then zap.  newscast    Paez is fried.    Okay wait wait wait do we have-forget reenactments-do we have a copy of the real broadcast from that night?  All we have are descriptions. There is no existing recording of what was broadcast that night. And-and youll understand why in a second.   By all accounts it worked.   Outside it was sheer mayhem ast   Everything that happened next happened extremely quickly. People poured out into the streets. People were running but they didnt know where to run. The spaceship was supposedly in the north of the city but this black cloud of gas was in the south and a lot of them actually did what any good Catholic would do. They made a beeline for the church.   The church because they thought theyd be safe there? Or-or?  Perhaps. Or perhaps because they wanted to get right with god before the world ended. There are even reports and I wasnt able to confirm this but there are reports of men confessing to adultery right there in front of their wives.   Ohh.  And priests absolving whole crowds at once.  Panico en la calle de quito que ella ya no pude hacer nada tuvimos que salir  This is Jorge Ribadeneira who is a long-time journalist worked for many years at the newspaper. He was listening with his family. They all believed it. They all ran outside found a taxi cab threw the kids in  ran behind the taxi cab.   decir.  They were going to-  Tuvimos que salir.  Flee the city.  Cuando llegamos a la calle  And he tells me that he sees-going the other way-this convoy of military trucks.   Filled with soldiers.  Wait real trucks? Real military vans?  Real military vans with real soldiers. And cops behind them and theyre screaming towards the north of the city.  Where are they going?  Theyre going to Cotocollao to fight the Martians.   Get out.  So if you had any doubt at this point once you saw those military vans you were like oh bleep Ive got to get the hell out.  Right.  Wait wait wait I-I-I-does-does everybody in Quito believe-didnt someone call the general beforehand and say tonight were having a broadcast-  Well they-the mayor or someone who sounded an awful lot like the mayor was on the radio saying Martians were invading.  The mayor didnt call the general before-  Uh no. No.  So-so then what happens at the end of the show? Assuming it ends the way they always do ha ha ha this is a joke then what?  Well they stormed the radio station.    Good.  By the time the broadcast ended and it was announced that the whole thing was a play  Hmm. TONY FIEl Uh huge crowds were in the streets.   And word that it was a hoax spread pretty quickly. All that fear turned pretty quickly to anger   By 30 theres a few hundred people outside the station. At some point this boxer shows up. There had just been a match in the central plaza and the boxer shows up and hes driving this truck and the truck is full of rocks.  Is full of what? Rocks?  Its full of rocks. Yeah.  Huh.  And people start hurling the rocks at the station at the windows. And windows are shattering. They manage to break into the ground floor where the printing presses are. Theyre smashing printing presses. At some point some people in the crowd materialize and they have these flaming torches and it just goes up like a match.  So-so were people hurt during this?  Six people died.  Oh really.  Yeah. Most escaped. There was about 50 people in the building. Most got up to the roof jumped to adjoining buildings but six people died. According to reporter Tony uh one guy stayed behind. The last guy on the air that night was a man by the name of Luis Beltran . Maria are you there?  Yes Im here.  Okay this is Maria Beltran Testagrossa  Luis Beltrans daughter. And Maria you-you were listening to everything that just came before this.  Yeah.  Tell us the story from your dads perspective from here forward.  Uh well he was-he was on the air he was uh I guess hosting the music program and also doing some of the interruptions with the-the bogus Martians.  But the point-the point at which the fire started what was he saying? When he realized the magnitude of the situation he went back on the air and began pleading for help pleading for assistance from the police and the fire department but uh as you said before no help came because the police were going to fight the Martians.  Yeah.   And uh eventually he was the last one left and uh and he jumped out the window. I guess from either the third or fourth floor onto a uh second floor balcony.  Hmm.  And to break the fall- I guess instinctively you want to break the fall-he grabbed onto the railing of that balcony. He was completely engulfed in flames at that point and the skin on his hands just remained on the balcony like a barbeque grill.  Wow.  And uh from there he jumped to the ground but before he jumped he was pleading to the crowd to I guess catch him but they didnt. He landed on cement.  Oof.  Broke legs arms ribs everything and compounded by the very very serious burns that he had all over his body.  So he landed at the feet of an angry mob. What did-  An angry mob and he uh he recalled-as hes losing consciousness-he just heard somebody say-just-just let him die in peace. Although some of the articles that I read-they tried to throw him back into the building.  Really?  Someone uh grabbed him and put him in a jeep to take him to the hospital. Just a bystander. And you know he had so many scars-he had-as children my brother and I would play with his scars we would trace them with our finger and ask him what happened you know how he got the scars and he would tell us about the fire.  Would he tell you the whole story? Or  how much of this did you know?   No he didnt tell us the whole story. He would just give us in broad terms that he had been in a building that had caught fire. As children we didnt really ask him. Maybe had we been older and we had asked him he wouldve told us the whole story.  Hmm. And we should say that your dad stayed behind to try and help other people to get out of the building. Let me ask you a question thought uh your dad is obviously a hero but given the fact that he was one of the voices that created the panic-  Mm hmm.  The panic did he feel some sort of ambivalence about-  I dont know in retrospect whether he did or not. Im sure there mustve been some ambivalence but from what I understand the story was kept-it was very top secret so that even the employees did not know what was going to be broadcast during that music program.  Really wow.  Um I dont know at what point he was informed of the details though I dont know how he felt about it. I wish I had had an opportunity to ask him.  Mmm. Well listen Maria thank so much for your time in joining us here and-  Sure.  Uh you know thanks.  Take care.   I just want to know what happened to the guy who planned the hoax.  Uh well he uh-he got out through the roof like a lot of others. He hopped to the next building hid out for a few days and then fled the country to Venezuela never to return.   Never to return?   Never to return. But I should say that among the six people who died that night was his girlfriend and a nephew of his.   Okay so the 1949 Quito broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble. The 1938 New York broadcast caused a whole lot of trouble. Now everybody here before who raised their hand and thought that this could happen again you are right. Again. Now Buffalo. 1968.    roadcast Halloween night.   Updated for the times sounds kind of like your basic DJ set until you hear this  roadcast What is this? Joe Alley  is handing me something that Im supposed to read thank you. Thank you Joe.  Uh lets see the NASA the National Space and Aeronautics Administration those people have alerted all their space watch and uh facilities to be on the alert for unusual communication difficulties tonight. A spokesman for the federal agency referred to the explosions on the planet Mars and said it was not known if it would have the same effect on Earth communications as similar explosions on the surface of the sun I guess theyre talking about sunspots and things like that so uh I dont know it means that its going to be hard to hear communications from NASA can you hear me down there in South Carolina? As long as you can hear WKBW what difference does it make about communications? Rock n roll WKBW Jackson...Halloween night...all together where it is...WKBW.   WKBW broadcast followed the same structure as the original broadcast weve hear tonight long stretches of music then the news bulletins then the semi-realistic field reports heres one of them  roadcast ...you got walking injuries or   You got the same vivid descriptions of Martians  roadcast I can hardly look at it I can hardly look it. Its dripping saliva!   And according to the station manager Jeff Kay  he kept the same outcome people bought it.  uffalo police and telephone company reported to WKBW that they received more than 4000 phone calls. The Canadian military authorities dispatched military units to the Peace Bridge the Rainbow Bridge and the Queenston Bridge to repel invaders. The story was carried the next day by 47 newspapers countrywide and on the night of the show and during the show united press bureaus up and down the east coast of America were besieged by phone calls asking about the Martian invasion in Buffalo. Incredible? Youre absolutely right it is incredible.     Thanks to the folks at WKBW Buffalo for that. What is this music by the way?   This is the disco version of War of the Worlds 1978.      Theres a disco version.   Still sells a lot of copies youd be surprised. Heres the obvious question to ask why does this keep working?   Well thats a difficult question I came across a psychology professor.   Im Richard Gerrig Im a professor of psychology in the cognitive experiential program at Stony Brook University.   He has this notion Richard Gerrig does that at root people are suckers for stories we just cannot help ourselves. When a story starts you just kind of go whoop.   I think the norm is to fall into the story and that its unusual to sort of keep yourself from falling in. My favorite example is theres a scene in Goldfinger  nger movie     Bam bam bam.   Yeah the all time best James Bond movie I think where Bond is tied down spread eagle on a piece of metal and theres this lazer coming toward him which really looks like its going to cut him in two. And even as Im saying that right now Im starting to feel a little bit of anxiety cause Im picturing it my head     Picturing that lazer coming toward him and you know spoiler alert he doesnt actually get split in two by the lazer yeah sorry. But heres the thing go and watch the movie now and see if you can get through that scene without experiencing the suspense. And it really seems to say something very powerful and strong about how immersed we can become in the narrative world.  nger movie      This is Radiolab Im Jad Abumrad.   And Im Robert Krulwich.   And this     is the sound of 700 people whove come to bear witness to a recording of our show today. We are in the Fitzgerald Theater in St. Paul Minnesota talking about the strange phenomenon that is the War of the Worlds.   You know its really great that everybodys here of course but theres one guy I really wish had been here.   Whos that?   The Ecuadorian guy Leonardo-whats his-   Paez.   Yeah yeah. Because hes the guy I wanna ask like what were you thinking? Thats what I want to know.     Well hes dead.   Hes dead yeah.   Yeah.   Well but how about Orson Welles. I would say to him what were you thinking I would say.   Uh dead.   Dead yeah. So I found a guy who I think is definitely alive.   I am Daniel Myrick co-writer co-director of The Blair Witch Project.   Before making The Blair Witch Project Dan Myrick heard a recording of the War of the Worlds. He was pretty young at the time he was a teenager.   I just thought it was brilliant absolutely the coolest thing.  And more than anything else he was impressed by the technique of the thing.   Theres a couple moment in particular where they cut to the kind of on-site reporter-  y Theater Now well return you to Carl Phillips in Grovers Mill.   And its almost like they cut in a second or two early and you hear the reporter saying so are we on?  y Theater Ladies and gentlemen am I on?   Are we-are we on?  y Theater Ladies and gentlemen   And then he goes into his-into character.  y Theater ...back of a stonewall   And its those beat those little moments that really make it convincing. I get this kind of guilty excitement when I-when I know how it affected people.   And he was fascinated by the idea that scary stories get even scarier if you think theyre true so years later fresh out of film school he and his friend Eduardo Sanchez decided to develop their own uh Welles-like project. Its your basic scary witch story. Three uh kids go into the woods.  vie Okay okay okay were leaving right now.   They get lost they bump into the witch and then they die or they think they die at least you never see them again.  vie ..no please   But when you entered the theater to see The Blair Witch Project the first thing youd see on the screen are these two sentences In October of 1994 three student filmmakers disappeared in the woods near Burkittsville Maryland while shooting a documentary. A year later their footage was found. So the suggestion here is that what we see might be real.   Well we picked a subject matter that was difficult to disprove to the casual observer. Martians invading from outer space- you turn the channel to the next network and if no ones reporting about it then youre pretty well assured that its probably fiction but three missing students in the woods you know thats something thats a little harder to disprove without a fair amount of scrutiny.   And it worked.   We were getting calls from police wondering where these three kids were and how come they never heard of this case-   Youre kidding?  Oh yeah I mean it was constant. We still get emails occasionally on what part of the storys real. You know is there still any phenomena out in Burkittsville and da da da. Its all fiction and it was all made up and I think it reinforces what Ed and I suspected that so much of us wants to believe.   Some people told Dan Myrick that after watching those three campers go into the woods they themselves would never go camping again.     And he thought that was fabulous. He loved it.   Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa why would you not want people to go camping?        I mean honestly why would you do that to people?   Well I-I asked him.   I mean thats why youre doing it. Were not making this movie to kind of scare people. We were making the film to really scare people.     No regrets on people not wanting to go camping.   So the question is is that what Orson Welles was up to back in 1938? Was he just trying to give people a good ol fashioned show business scare make them scream way up in the balcony? Cause remember at the time that is what he claimed that this was simply an entertainment.   This is Orson Welles ladies and gentlemen out of character to assure you that the War of the Worlds has no further significance than as the holiday offering it was intended to be. The Mercury Theaters own version of dressing up in a sheet and jumping out of a bush and saying boo!   But 16 years later Orson Welles changed the story. Here he is on the BBC the year is 1955.   In fact we werent as innocent as we meant to be. When we did the Martian broadcast we were fed up with the way in which everything that came over this new magic box the radio was being swallowed so in a way our broadcast was an assault on the credibility of that machine. We wanted people to understand that they shouldnt swallow everything that came through the tap.   So here are two ways to think about the War of the Worlds. One it was a smashing entertainment using every trick they could think of including inventing some new ones to scare you silly. Master storytelling. Or-or and it was were trying to send you a warning. Dont trust everything you hear on the radio its not always true.   So which one was it you think?   Well I asked a professor Jason Loviglio.  Me?   Yeah you.   Jason?   Yeah him. Hes a radio historian at the University of Maryland. He says that what Welles understood was that a newscast is often two things at once. In a newscast you hear something scary or disturbing sometimes but its going to be told to you in a way that soothes you meaning the authority of the voice the newscasters steady voice coming through the radio-it will calm you like President Roosevelts famous fireside chats.  elt My friends I want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the United States about banking.   When you study the rhetoric that Roosevelt used he really did convey two messages. One were in terrible danger and two Ive got it covered. And that is sort of the-the authoritative voice coming out of the darkness this sort of invisible disembodied voice of the powerful man um the news anchor.  newscast September 22 1940.   And well see this with Murrow on the rooftops of Britain.   Im standing on a rooftop   During the blitz.   Looking out over London. Straight in front of me now youll hear two sounds in just a moment . There they are.   Hes giving us a story of an unfolding emergency.   I should think in a few minutes there will be shrapnel around here.   But his mastery of information his mastery of his own voice his bravery on the scene.   You may be able to hear the sounds of guns off in the distance very very faintly like someone kicking a tub.   This was the beginning of the formatting of fear the formatting of crisis and so people go the news-not to be afraid but to be afraid and then to be reassured.   Robert?   Uh huh?   You file things for the news.   Yeah.   Do you buy this? That a news reporter does these two things simultaneously scares and then reassures and then scares-   No no you never go you know cover the governor and say first Im going to scare them and then Im going to assuage them no one would do that.   But why else would you talk that way? I mean not you.   Oh!   But I mean   That the form-in the news is a-because the guy is always there because hes an anchor thats the word means. It is a reassuring thing to see night after night telling and telling. But Loviglio says that the real genius of the War of the Worlds was the Welles put you into a newscast where you expect anchors to anchor and you expect reporters to report and then bzzzt he kills the reporter and the anchor.     And suddenly youre left all by yourself in your own living room all alone.     That is exactly right. The moment of the War of the Worlds broadcast which still frankly terrifies me its this moment right here.  y Theater ...head on...the flames  woods...automobiles...spreading...coming this way now...about 20 yards to my right-   Its like that silence is terrifying. No anchor no reporter. No one to reassure you. Okay but forgetting that for a moment what about this second lesson he had to teach us-the thing about dont believe the radio? What about that? Did it work?   Well Professor Loviglio says if that is really what Welles was trying to do if you believe that well then he failed-actually he worse than failed. The War of the Worlds not once not twice-weve told-shown you three broadcasts tonight it was so good at grabbing an audience and sucking them in that the Welles formula-you might call it-the newscast that scares you enough to keep you listening has been adopted by-of all folks-news companies.  adcast montage Right now at 11 a night of shopping turned into a night of fear...swarming over borders flooding cities and towns...Muslim immigrants ...teens texting and driving its a deadly mix terror in the toilet and sinkholes and landslides python in the potty... A rabid baby goat terrorist working at one of our airports?   Terror in the toilet pythons in the potty I-maybe there was some-   Could be true.   Snakes somewhere near a toiletry facility of some kind but it probably wasnt a python and it probably wasnt your toilet but you dont know that. You want to hear that it belongs to Mrs. James C. McGillicutty of 2214 Beaudry  Boulevard and not you so you-you want to be reassured and so you listen and so fall in. And if Orson Welles retelling a Martian invasion story by H.G Wells-     that most people already knew- if he could grab us and if they could do it again in Ecuador and then if they can do it again in Buffalo what does that tell you? It tells you that we cant help ourselves. Even if the headline is slightly preposterous even if its slightly scary even if its slightly false we will listen.   The fear that these broadcasts generate now suck us in and youd think 70 years later wed be more sophisticated and critical when the local newscaster tells us that theres something were feeding our children that could kill them and theyll tell-we-I still listen. Im a media critic and I still wade through the commercials to see what is it that Im doing to kill my child?   Even it its really . Your shoelaces will kill you after this message.   I-somehow it gets me every time.   Yeah and Welles knew.
