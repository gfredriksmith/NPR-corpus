       Hey this is Jad. Very proud to present to you guys starting today here on Radiolab a miniseries from producer Molly Webster.     Hi I am Molly Webster.     For the last ...     ... I do not know I would say three years ...     I have been ...     ... doing a lot of reporting about how humans make more of themselves right? Like science stories ethical stories. And we came up with this idea that you know rather than me reporting only on reproduction for the next 10 years at Radiolab that what if we just put them all together in a series? And so we are about to do that. For the next month we are gonna do the series and the name of the series is Gonads.     Gonads. I know what you are thinking why?   I am gonna ask you a question. You can say no. What do you think about the word gonads?   Gonads? That is crazy question.   It is almost like that word moist where it gives you like a little uhh!   Yes that word does have certain connotations.   What do you think of?   Gonads? Is not that nuts?   It is a slang term for balls.   Balls.   Testicles.   Testicles.   Balls.   Definitely balls.   Definitely balls.   You got cojones like ...   It is just used in like ...   Stupid boy humor.   So almost like toxic masculinity situation.   You just think like sweaty balls and male jokes pretty much.   Like kick you in the 'nads?   Great. Would you think it has anything to do with ladies?   No.   No.   No.   Oh no.   Did you know that ladies actually have gonads also? That gonads are both testes and ovaries?   Oh really?   That it is actually for men and women.   Really?   I did not know that.   I did not know that.   Did not know that.   90 of the people I talked to ...   Did not know that.   They did not know it.   Who would have thought women and men both have gonads?   Culture. They have stolen the word and made it male.   And I think it is time we reclaim this word. Like as a citizen as a human as a lady as a science lover I am taking the word back.     Okay. So this is episode one and this whole series like kind of came into being with a single phrase.   Oh right the duck is in the house.   From this guy.   Can you say for me your name and how you identify yourself?   I am Kutluk Oktay. I am an ovarian biologist. So I have a research laboratory at Yale University School of Medicine.   So Oktay he is the one who said that ...   Gonads are magical organs.  They are! That is our magical organ.     So Oktay is Turkish.   You know I was a curious kid.   He grew up in Istanbul.   I was a Trekkie as a child. And as -- and when I was 10 years old I would you know look into universe and the skies and -- and trying to understand you know? Make sense of this whole thing.   What was it about the sky that attracted you?   It was the concept of infinity. You know we are just living a mundane life on this planet without thinking of anything but our routine concerns. But at the same time we have got this vast space around us and mostly we have no clue.   Mm-hmm.   We live oblivious to that fact. And I would lose sleep over that when I was a kid.   Really?   Yeah.   Fast-forward. Oktay goes to medical school in Turkey. He becomes a doctor specifically an OB-GYN.   So I had to deliver a lot of babies probably 20000 or so.   Wow!   That is like birthing a small town.   And then you know having -- after having made 20000 delivery I said you know perhaps this is not my calling. I wanted to be a little bit more -- more towards the beginning of the process. You know when you are an obstetrician you are dealing with the finished product right?   Well I just think that is a crazy statement because most people think babies are the very beginning of the process. I am not sure what gets more beginning than like a small baby.   Popping out of a lady.   That feels ...   That feels like the starting line.   We have started something!   Yeah.   But in Oktay's case there was like some sense that most of the decisions most of something had already been decided by the time the baby gets out.   And that whole process is fascinating.   So we dragged him into the studio to talk about magical gonads. Basically just to figure out why are they magical?   I am interested how you settled on that word.   Yeah. What did I say? You know I think magical for many reasons. One is their origin you know? They ...   And he told me what he learned when he started studying this stuff was that the origin of the gonad like its creation is sort of the beginning because it starts with this whole saga that is so involved and so extreme that the baby itself does kind of feel like an afterthought. He calls it ...   The Great Migration.   The Great Migration.   Yeah.   Oktay got me into this story and so I ended up calling a bunch of people about it.   In my lab we have a slogan that says Gonads or Go Home. We have t-shirts.   You do not! You do?   We do. We have a t-shirt.   That is Blanche Capel.   Professor in cell biology at Duke University Medical Center.   She essentially studies all the parts of the story we are about to tell you. Okay so to place this story in time ...   It begins at about oh two or three weeks in humans I bet.   Let us say day 24 just to be safe. Which basically means a sperm fertilized an egg 23 days ago. It could be petri dish it could be sex who knows? But inside this woman's uterus there is a little organism that has been growing for 24 days.   What does the embryo look like at that point?   That is my comrade-in-arms Pat Walters who is the editor of the series.   Actually I do not know how to describe this very well to you. I could send you a picture.   Does it kind of look like a tadpole?   Exactly.   That is not so wrong.   It looks like a tadpole. And if you look at very early embryos it is like curled up.   There is a tail.   Got a little tail.   There is like the sort of ball of the embryo that is like forming the developing body and then it has this like sweep of a tail that is coming off. And if you zoom into the tail you will see a little region.   It is called the allantois.   Called the allantois.   Which is the trash bag of the embryo. Before the embryo has an excretory system it dumps things that it does not want in the allantois.   Urine flows in and out there. It is where gas exchange with the mother happens.   So ...   It is kind of a terrible place.   It is like a foreign planet.   This is not actually part of the embryo itself?   No it is sort of in the hinterlands. The allantois I always imagined was -- is the -- where Harrison Ford was camped out in Blade Runner 2049 which is like that vast dust desert.   Super orange dust yeah.   And there is like windstorms and -- and like wind blowing over the desert. I imagine it like that. And it is here where you find some cells ...   These very specialized cells germ cells.   The germ cells.   Primordial germ cells.   These are the cells that are gonna go on that Great Migration and put the magic in the gonad.   They -- they are a very interesting cell type. They are -- they are set aside very early in embryogenesis.   And how many are there? Are there like a thousand? Two thousand?   I think they are something like 40.   Wait that is it?   Yes.   40. Biblical number.   And the irony here is -- is these cells sort of like huddled at the edges of this wasteland might actually be the most important cells in the body. Because after the embryo grows after the baby gets born after that baby goes through puberty and one day maybe decides to have a kid these cells which are present at the very beginning these cells are in charge of making a next generation of you.   I mean that is the meaning of life right? That is the origin of life these cells. Everything else I mean we think it is brain heart et cetera but I think everything else is there to support the survival of the germ cell.   They are the stem cell of the species right?   So stem cell means a cell that can create other cells. An originator cell.   We have stem cells for lungs stem cells for heart stem cells for neurons.   These cells are the only cells that can make on their own all the other kind of cells. They can make a whole person.   So it is a -- they have a remarkable underlying pluripotency.   Mmm.   Do you think they know that?   Well that is -- I mean those are very difficult questions to answer.   I do not know. I think germ cells know they are really special cells but I do not think they know what they are gonna become.   Wait can I ask you a question? If they are so special why do they start out in the trash?   Yeah that seems like a bad place.   You would think. It is very curious that the germ cells arise near that position and it is unclear why.   Or you hide your most precious object in the trash dump!  This has like got the best Mission Impossible like Murder On the Orient Express.   Yup. Maybe that is the plan I do not know.   In all seriousness for some reason -- and scientists do not know exactly why -- it seems like evolution has decided to set these cells aside at the beginning of development which means they have to make a journey back to the middle of the embryo where their destinies will be revealed.   And if they make it there we make it there.   If they do not ...   We do not.   Okay. Okay. So -- so they hang around this dusty wasteland for a few days huddled against the elements.   I wonder what that is like for them to be stuck there.   I imagine if I was in that situation I would just like be like wondering how this was my lot in life. This is some sort of cosmic joke? Like I have a sense -- I have a sense I may be important but I am just here.   Do not know why.   In the wasteland. So they hang out like that for a couple of days and then Doo doo! There is a call. They hear a call. They maybe smell a call.   Let us say hear.   There is a signal ...   They are called into action.   And so ...   The cells start migrating.   They literally move.   Wow! What -- wait. So how does a cell march?   They actually extend filopodia which are little cell-like feet.   Okay. Is it like it pops out two feet and then it goes walking?   Cells send out extensions and that extension has a little adhesion molecule on it like a little sticky spot. So when it puts its foot out it can pull the rest of the cell up to it.   Whoa!   So they take a hike. Hike hike hike ...   And interestingly the germ cells seem to be holding hands like a long string of paper dolls.   Okay.   And they touch each other. It is as though they are -- the whole crowd is like going together.   And after a bit of a hike they get to the wall of the embryo which is like I do not know a pulsating mass. And somehow ...   This is a very blurry period I have to say.   They push their way through the wall.   And on the other side it is just chaos there. It is like a foreign planet.   Because what is happening is -- I mean the embryo is just like dividing dividing dividing dividing dividing.   You know the whole embryo is developing very fast at this stage.   Trying to start forming parts. Like it wants to form organs it wants to form a nervous system.   There are all kinds of signals flying around to tell the gut to form and to tell the liver to form.   Blood cells are popping up. Neurons.   You know all these signals are flashing all around and yet the germ cells ...   Their job is to block it all out.   They migrate right down the middle of the embryo at the mid-line.   Almost like where you could think like a spine would be.   Through a forest of signals going around in the embryo.   And these signals are bombarding. Trying to tempt them. Like Hey be a liver cell! Be a liver cell! Come be a liver! Be a liver! And sometimes these cells are like Hmm wait. Do I want to be a liver? Am I a liver? No wait. Something tells me I should keep marching.   It seems scary does not it?   Yeah.   Yeah they go through a battle.   Hey do you know if they ever lose one along the way? Like the chain is going and they are trying to like Do not differentiate! Do not differentiate! Does like the fourth one from the end ever go like pew! And just become a stomach? And then like oh crap!   We lost Stan! Keep going!   Hurry! Hurry! It probably happens.   But they try to stay focused together and they try to resist all of those signals that could divert them from their destiny. They want to stay uncommitted.   These might be the last cells in the developing mammalian embryo to give up their world of possibilities.   This is David Page. He is the director of the Whitehead Institute. Biologist at MIT.   If you see what I am saying. So basically when a -- when an egg is fertilized by a sperm to go back to the -- that beginning the resulting cell called a zygote the fertilized egg has the possibility has the potential to become every type of cell in the body. And as one cell becomes two and two become four and so on and so on eventually some cells give up that broad range of possibilities and become committed to narrower occupations and specializations. You know we have at least 200 or 300 specialized cell types that make up our body. All the other cells make the transition from possibility to reality and those migrating primordial germ cells are the last cells to give up a wide range of possibilities.   Oh I like them for their like pugnaciousness.   Yes yes.   Okay so getting back to the band of 40. We are back in the thick of things. They are marching through the middle of the embryo being like pelted and torn at fighting off all these other signals. And they do this for one day two days three days four five ...   I imagine the get tired as they go.   Six seven eight nine ...   But the signal that they are following is getting stronger. And then pretty soon over the horizon on kind of either side of the path they start to see these mountains.   The urogenital ridge is going to emerge as sort of a mountain off the back wall of the body cavity.     So they are still marching down this path. They are following the signal. The mountains are getting closer and closer. And then at some point the path in front of them splits. It goes to the left and it goes to the right and half the cells will go to the left and half the cells will go to the right. Regardless of what direction they go in they end up at the base of a mountain. And the mountain is a mass of like a dense mass of cells and they come right up to the edge of the mountain wall and they are able to just like push those cells aside and like squeeze into the interior of the mountain. Which is an entirely new space.   So the germ cells enter. Enter the gonad.   Oh this is the gonad.   Yeah this is the place that will either be an ovary or a testes.   And which -- I mean has it been figured out which it is?   No. At this point it could go either way.   Huh.   I think about this place as a cathedral. And the cathedral it is sort of under construction. And as they walk in they -- they probably know immediately that this is the place that is been calling them because that signal they have been following it is everywhere.   Maybe when they get to the gonad the whole cell is surrounded by the signal and that tells the cell to stop. But this is just a guess.   What do you think it is like for the -- for the germ cells? Like sort of they have been going on this walk and then they get to a place that says Stay here. So I wonder what the Stay here like I do not know feels like.   Oh I think it feels like home.   After marching for almost two solid weeks they finally arrived.   They recognize this is where they belong.   But everyone I talked to said probably still at this point ...   They do not even know what lies ahead for them.   Or even why they are there.   We are anthropomorphizing but why not?   David Page again.   I would suggest that the primordial germ cells they have been instructed to migrate to the genital ridge. But they do not know why and they do not know what they are gonna do when they get there. They have not a clue.   But the clue is coming!         Okay so to pick up on the action the tribe of 40 they find themselves in this cathedral-like space. Technical name?   The mesonephric gonadal region.   I will call it the House of Gonad.   Mm-hmm.   They are in this beautiful space.   But they do not know why.   But what happens is immediately when they enter ...   They are surrounded by somatic cells.   I imagine these cells as like friendly monks just gliding around in red robes.   Their job is to just protect you and make sure that nothing bad happens to you.   So these are the cells that have been calling them?   I do not know.   It is kind of a hard question to answer because the genital ridge had just started forming when the germ cells began their migration. So no one really knows like what was sending the signal. But after a few days some people say a few weeks these somatic cells that are gathered around the germ cells will lean in real close and they reveal the destiny. They tell them either one of two things. You will become a sperm. Or you will become an egg.   What exactly are these monk cells doing though? I mean to make them change are they like bumping them in some special way? Or ...   No no no. They are releasing proteins.   Well there are molecular signaling cascades that are controlling the male or female fate of the -- of the germ cells.   And what makes them go one way or the other?   Ugh that is super complicated and we are gonna get into it later in the series. So for now I will just say ...   In mammals sex is genetically controlled by whether or not you have two X chromosomes or an X and a Y chromosome.   So it is just basically like your fourth grade biology. If the cells in the cathedral have a y-chromosome they will -- they will say sperm and if the cells in the cathedral have an XX chromosome they will say egg.   So it is still basically just fate and luck as to what -- which way they go.   Yes but here's the cool part. If the monks tell the germ cells that they are gonna be sperm they basically divide a little bit and then the monks like take the germ cells and they put them to sleep. They sort of -- I do not know -- entomb them in these like catacombs until after birth and puberty. But if the germ cells get told that they are gonna be eggs something different happens inside of them and they just go nuts.   They divide. They divide quite a lot. Rapidly for a while.   Suddenly the band of 40 becomes a thousand and two thousand and ten thousand. The monks then take each of these new eggs and embed them in the wall of the cathedral.   Divide.   Boom!   Divide.   Boom!   Divide.   Boom!   Divide.   Boom!   They literally shove the eggs into the wall of the House of Gonad?   Yes. And this goes on for months.   As a matter of fact their numbers probably reach around 6 to 10 million during the fifth month of pregnancy about 20 weeks of gestation.   That embryonic ovary is gonna have all the eggs it will ever have when it is only five months along.   Wait this is all still in utero?   This is all in utero it is happening.   It has 10 million eggs and it is still itself months away from being born?   Yes. Theoretically at that point that is 500 times more babies than Oktay ever delivered in his career in this one developing embryo.   Fuck!   Yeah I know.   God you know what just occurred to me? Like if you go all the way back to the beginning of this story you told Day 24 or whatever it was. You have got this little organism forming probably the mother does not even know it is there yet. But already there are these cells in existence that will be the kid of the kid she does not even know she has yet. So her grandkids are in there already. Is that right?   So when you are pregnant with a person you carry inside of you the cells that will make the next -- oh you are right it is granddaughter.   It is like -- it is like your grandkids are already ...   Inside of you.   Inside of your unborn child.   Yes.   That is bananas!   Yes.   Do you think the great grandkids are in there too?   Well it is like all this -- that is what she means by stem cell of the species because it is the same material that makes -- they then -- they not only make the body they make more eggs and sperm. They make the next generation of egg and sperm. So they are -- so they are both making a generation but then making the ability for that generation to make another generation.   Oh my God! This is like -- this is like humanity.   It is mirrors. You are not only cradling like your child you are cradling like infinite future Homo sapiens.   Wow!   That is the infinity.   It is crazy that all that is there and you are not even a thing yet. That the first thought -- or thought? I do not know. The first thing that this organism has been programmed to do is not Hey make a -- make a person make a brain make a life. No it is Make more.   Yeah it is pretty gnarly.   Yeah.   You know many many people believe that we exist just as a harbor for our germ cells until we can make new people.   Like we are just their hosts.   In some sense that is absolutely true. I mean or as -- as was said a long time ago a chicken is an egg's way of making another egg.    Really? I have never heard that before.   So I was in Michigan a couple of weeks -- months ago. And so I was in Michigan and I was kayaking on this river that has super sandy bottom and it is pretty shallow. I do not know it is like three or four feet deep. And the cool thing was that the salmon were spawning. Huge fish! They were like three to four feet. They were so thick around and there were so many of them that they would like rustle my kayak. And I see something kind of in this one part of the river like by itself and I look and it is a fish. It is a salmon that is lying on the bottom of the river. And I see like through the ripply water some like pink. So I turn the kayak around to go like look at it. And what I realize is the pink is not like flesh. The pink is like packed eggs. The body was sliced open so you could see into the hollow. And in the hollow were just like -- what felt like millions of these like bubblegum pink drops of eggs.   Like the entire body cavity was packed eggs. And to think that parts of our body male and female by the way because the testes do this just little later in life -- to think that parts of our body are like that fish it felt like just pulling back the curtain and seeing something that I can never unsee.     This episode was reported by me Molly Webster and produced by Jad Abumrad. Original music by Dylan Keefe. Ballad Of The Fish and The Gonads Theme were written performed and produced by Majel Connery and Alex Overington. Radiolab Presents Gonads is produced by Rachael Cusick and edited by Pat Walters. One last thing before I go. Later in the series we are gonna dig into sex-ed and one of the things that comes up in every conversation you have about sex-ed is a book that somebody read to learn about the birds and the bees. It might have been given to them or they found it like in their library book sale. So we want to try and create an online sex-ed library with as many of these books as we can find for all ages. So go to Radiolab.orgSexEdBooks and tell us about a book you got as a kid and the reason you loved it or did not. And then we are gonna add it to the shelf. And it is gonna be great. So that is it. That is our episode and see you next time. Bye.      -30-
