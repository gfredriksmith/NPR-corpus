     This is Radiolab. Today? Translation. We will have eight experiments in translation transcreation.   Hello?   Hi there.   Hi!   Is that Doug?   Yes.   Oh boy!   So this episode was inspired by a guy named Doug.   Doug Hofstadter professor of cognitive science Indiana University Bloomington.   You may know him as the guy who wrote Godel Escher Bach which is a hugely influential book in certain circles. Published in I think 1979. But we actually got interested in him thanks to our producer Lynn Levy because of an obsession of his which predates that.   16. I was 16.   The year 1961.   I was taking a French literature class and one day I came across this poem.   A tiny little poem that kind of sat right in the middle of the page.   Like a long thin sausage. Vertical. You know three syllables per line.   So it was super skinny.   And 28 lines long.   And long.   And it was delightful. It was very cute and funny. I fell in love with the poem immediately and memorized it. I still know it by heart.   The poem was basically a get-well card. It is written by this guy Clment Marot who was a poet in the early 1500s.   At the court of a queen.   And he wrote the poem for this queen's daughter. She was 7 or 8 and she had gotten sick.   The flu or something.   And this poem was supposed to cheer her up.   And -- and I thought it was very sweet.   Could you say it in French?   Yeah let us just hear it first.   Okay. It is called A une Damoyselle malade. To A Sick Damsel so to speak.   A sick young lady.   A sick young lady. Ma mignonne je vous donne le bon jour le sjour cest prison. Gurison recouvrez puis ouvrez votre porte et quon sorte vitement car Clment le vous mande. Va friande de ta bouche qui se couche en danger pour manger confitures si tu dures trop malade couleur fade tu prendras et perdras Lembonpoint. Dieu te doint sant bonne ma mignonne.   Oh my God you must have gotten so many chicks when you were 16.   I know! That was really ...      Exactly the opposite. I was -- I was the -- I wish.   Okay so he reads the poem files it away deep in the corner of his mind. Fast forward about 20 years he publishes his first book. It becomes very popular and the publisher decides to have it translated.   Into a number of languages including French.   And that process which took years ...   It put me into the frame of mind of thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts. And all of a sudden one day ...   That poem popped into his mind.   And I said Ah there is a challenge! Let us try to do this!   And when you say challenge like what was it?   What is the -- what is the challenge?   Okay. What I meant was to ...   So here's the thing. He says you got this poem ...   Ma mignonne je vous donne le bon jour ...   And if you just focus on the words it is basically -- it is just this guy talking to a younger girl saying Hello my dear. I am sorry you are sick. Being sick is like prison.   Le sjour cest prison.   I Clment wish you to open your doors get out into the world.   Car Clment le vous mande.   Get out of bed. Eat some jam.   Confitures.   So you do not look so pale ...   Couleur fade ...   ... and lose your plump shape.   Et perdras lembonpoint.   You know it is sort of like Get better. Here's to your good health.   Dieu te doint Sant bonne ma mignonne.   But just saying those words in English misses the whole spirit of the poem.   The tone the lightheartedness ...   And -- and this is key for Doug. It also ignores the poem's form.   Its wonderfully catchy ...   Little sausage shape on the page. The fact that the lines ...   Rhyme. You know AA BB CC DD. And the first line ...   Ma mignonne...   ... is identical to the last line.   Ma mignonne.   So it sort of has the feel of a palindrome?   It has the poet's name in the middle of the poem.   Clment le vous mande.   Oh and I -- did I say three syllables per line?   No you did not. Not yet.   Of course. Three syllables per line. I mean that is crucial. And then also 28 lines long. So all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me.   So Doug sat down and got to work and quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this poem? And along the way he even began to make little grids of possibilities for different lines of the poem. For example ...   Va friande de ta bouche qui se couche ...   Like this line that basically says Do not wallow in bed.   I had a lot of possibilities and I will just read you the little diagonal display here. Instead of spurting blood in bed. Instead of burping in your bed. Instead of bursting out in bed. Instead of lurking in your bed. Instead of hurtling out of bed. Instead of hurting there. Instead of squirming in your bed. Instead of slurping slop in bed. Instead of burning up in bed. Instead of turning blue in bed.   On and on.   And I came up with you want me to read my first translation?   Yeah please.   My sweet dear. I send cheer. All the best. Your forced rest is like jail. So do not ail very long. Just get strong. Go outside. Take a ride. Do it quick. Stay not sick. Ban your ache for my sake. Buttered bread while in bed makes a mess. So unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you would best soon arise. So your eyes will not glaze. Douglas prays health be near my sweet dear.   Oh. So Clment is now Douglas.   Yeah Clment became Douglas. And I like the word ...   But jam became bread though.   Buttered bread.   Buttered bread.   Buttered bread. Yes. Well I just figure jam and jelly they are words but the words represent concepts and the concepts have a kind of a halo around them. I mean when you talk about jelly you are implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on.   Oh how interesting!   Some people like to stick their fingers in jelly. No bread needed.   Okay. Okay fair enough.   Feeling like he had not quite nailed it Doug sent the poem to one of the guys that translated his first book into French.   Yeah.   A guy named ...   Oddly enough Bob French. And Bob was ...      I said Hey Bob can you do it? And Bob said Well I will give it a try.   Fairest friend let me send my embrace. Quit this place its dark halls and dank walls. In soft stealth regain health. Dress and flee off with me Clment who calls for you.   Very different in tone and really quite marvelous.   He got the pale face in there. He got the jam. He put Clment's name in the middle.   But at the same time it did not have the lightness. The tone is much more ancient.   Which you could argue well it is an ancient poem. But Doug says no no. There is a bigger problem.   It was 30 lines long. So extra long. And 28 was a sacrosanct number.   But that is just two lines though.   No no no no no. Clment Marot wrote a three-syllable poem of 28 lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a -- than a message. That is the message was get well.   Which is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was the form. That is what made the thing funny and charming. And so the question for him was who could get the feel but nail the form. And to make a long story short he ended up sending the poem out to like 60 people.   Doctoral students ...   Who my sweet I entreat. One regard. Oh 'tis hard dear recluse.   Colleagues friends ...   Chickadee I decree a fine day.   He even got his wife to do one.   Dart away from your cage and engage in brave flight so you might flee the croup.   That was all bird-themed.   Hope you swoop into ham apple jam and French bread.   Did you go running around from town to town saying Hey I got a little poem. Anybody want to give it a translation?   I certainly did. I am a person of binges. This began a binge you might say.   And that binge ended up becoming a 700-page book filled with translations of this poem.   Go ahead and read the best one now. This is the best one.   Yeah right. Right. No this is not the best one.   It is just one.   No stop it. Okay here we go. Okay. Okay.   This is also one of his but like the 20th one he did.   Pal petite gal so sweet. Hug from Doug. Some dumb bug dragged you down. Zap that frown. Feel the urge bugs to purge. From the scourge you will emerge in a trice. Sound advice from -- ahem -- Doug slash Clem. So smash flu. Come. Yoo-hoo. Come you who live to chew. Sheets eschew. Sweets let us chew. Pop a tart. Make your heart palpitate. Clem's mandate. Sure hope God cures your bod head to feet. Pal petite.   Sure hope God cures your bod!    . I must admit it is humorous.   Yeah!   Although not the best he says.   I -- I do want to get to my mother's translation because my mother's was somehow -- I am gonna have to look it up here. Where was it? Where in the world was it? This book is long and complicated and ...   This one from his mom he says came along years after he started.   Here it is.   And he thinks it might be the winner.   Hi toots. Get well. Hospital's prison and prison's hell. Get well. Flee your cell. Clment's orders in a nutshell. Go pig out. Open wide your mouth. Keep those sweetmeats going south. Unless you are hail you will turn pale. Lose ooh-la-la that wiggles your tail. God restore good health to you my little flower mon petite shoe.   Wow! That is cool!   Notice that she does not begin the poem and end the poem with the same line. She does not have 28 lines. She has maybe about 16 lines. She does not pay any attention to syllable count.   You must have hated this one.   Yeah this ...   I did. My first reaction was Oh Mom. No Mom. Come on! What do you -- come on! Did not you pay any attention to the form? And she said I did what I wanted to do. This is my feeling you know just that is what I did. And actually you know I have to say it has stood the test of time. It has some kind of pizzazz that no other one ever had.   But if she did not respect the form she did not do the syllables she did not rhyme it the way it is supposed to rhyme she did not give you 28 lines she even like halved that practically is that a translation then or is that just a mom? I do not -- what is that?   One hundred flowers bloom. As I got more and more deeply into this poem my philosophy started to become Chairman Mao's statement Let one hundred flowers bloom. In other words you can look at it from so many angles and each new angle enriches it and makes it more fun.   All right but you cannot read a hundred versions of every poem that you want to read.   Okay okay. I agree. You are right.   It does make me question though the rules of engagement in a way.   There are no rules. There are no rules. It is all informal.   Okay but there is jam in one of the translations and ham in the other. And they are -- like they are factually different food substances. Somehow like the facts of the poem should not be negotiable should they?   What is -- what do you mean by a fact? I mean a fact about the poem is that it was written by somebody in French. It is not in French anymore.   Wait but now here's what Jad I think was really wondering is the mission we thought was what was he saying not what do we make of what he is saying? What are the flavors of what he is saying? What are the variants of what he is saying?   And even beyond that. Like is not the expectation that you as a translator are giving me him. Like hey this this man is lost to time and now suddenly I get to experience him. But if a hundred flowers are blooming that somehow feels like I am not getting him at all.   Obviously you are getting to the question of what is translation and can it be done. My -- my feeling is that even though these translations that we have heard are all very different they all show something about Clment Marot.   Doug's basic point is that like any person is kind of a universe. They are too big to comprehend in their entirety and so any translation of say a poem or whatever is only gonna get you a tiny piece of that person a tiny refraction.   I mean look we have one photograph of Frdric Chopin. One photograph.   And in that picture he is scowling.   What did Frdric Chopin really look like? What was his smile like? You know you look at a photograph of Chopin and you say Oh this is what Chopin looked like. Well no. Chopin looked like many things. Even the very day that that photograph was taken he had thousands of different expressions on his face. But then what about a year earlier or 10 years earlier? I mean knowing Chopin is a very complex thing. It is not one thing. It is millions of different things that are united by analogy into something that we refer to as one thing.   We should say we looked into it and there are actually two pictures of Chopin but he is kind of scowling in both. Or you cannot really tell in the second one it is too disintegrated. But no smiles.     Number two.   I hear -- I hear the sound of a telephone. Hello?   Habari za asubuhi.   A story from Greg Warner.   Yes. Hi Jad.   Greg is NPR's East Africa correspondent.   You are in -- what time is it where you are?   It is -- it is evening.   He is based in Nairobi.   Around 30 in the evening which is embarrassing because I just told you good morning in Swahili but I forgot how to say good evening. So ...   Oh. Okay.   So Greg I mean we were just -- anyhow.   We called Greg up because he had written this article for this great website called transom.org about being a foreign reporter and working with translators and all the mishaps you know when you have to go from one language to another.   But there is actually a really good example that I did not use in the piece about the failure to communicate. I could tell you that story.   Sure yeah.   So -- so there is this word and you would not think of it as untranslatable but it is the word serious. And when you ...   Serious? Like ...   Serious. Like S-E-R-I-O-U-S.   Okay.   In my experience when you hear this word serious in East Africa it does not mean solemn or thoughtful or stern it actually almost never has something to do with your mood. What serious tends to mean is are you just talking to me or are you serious? Are you doing something? And usually doing is like some kind of transaction usually financial. I have been asked by you know many East African officials Are you gonna be serious with me? And it obviously means Are you gonna pay me a bribe?   Oh!   Usually I pretend to misunderstand at the key moment. I say Yes I am a very serious international journalist. And -- but the story that I want to tell you it took place a couple months ago.     Secretary Kerry ...     ... visited Ethiopia. And ...     Just a few days before Kerry's visit nine journalists had been arrested under this relatively recent anti-terrorism law that basically says that any criticism of the government is illegal.     And Secretary Kerry was giving this press conference.     You know he said all the things that you would expect him to say. He said we believe that free speech and open dialogue is important to the economic development of the country blah blah blah. But ...     This comment was also wrapped up in a lot of praise of Ethiopia. And ...     Then came time for questions. He took some vetted questions from the Ethiopian journalists two more from the traveling press. And to Kerry's credit ...     He sort of -- before he left the podium he was like You know what? We are just gonna try something different. We are gonna like call on an Ethiopian journalist.     Kerry points at this one guy in the second row. Young guy in his 20s boyish face wearing a mustache.           And then this guy's like Well every time a journalist is arrested the U.S. gives a statement about this but ...     This keeps happening.     So then he asks his question.     Is this lip service or are you seriously concerned? At this point everybody's just not looking at Kerry. They are all looking at this journalist who obviously had to take considerable personal risks in a place like Ethiopia in a crowd of journalists including state-run TV stations. He is -- this guy's on camera asking this extremely sensitive question about the arrested journalists.     And Kerry looks at him like ...     You got to be kidding.     Kerry sounds to me like he is sort of insulted by the question. And -- and yet ...   Right. So remember serious the word serious in East Africa can be translated very much as Are you doing something? Preferably like a financial transaction right? And so what this journalist is saying is Are you just talking about this or are you doing something? Maybe threatening Ethiopia with withdrawing aid or withdrawing support. And Kerry says I am very seriously talking about this.     And it seemed to me maybe you know you can judge but it seemed like he was almost like Look I am like the most serious politician that is out there. I mean I lost the presidential race in 2004 in part because I was deemed too serious by the American public. You know like What are you accusing me of not being serious?   We put in a number of requests to speak to John Kerry or someone in the State Department but there was no response.   Do you think he was aware of the misunderstanding?   Who Kerry?   No this -- this fellow.   Oh yeah. No I followed him out afterward.       He is a young guy in his 20s. He is an independent journalist.     And I was like you know listen what happened there -- and I almost felt like some kind of cultural guide.                     So that conversation was about five months ago.   Do you know what his fate at all? I mean have you found out whether -- did he suffer for this question in any way?   No but I have his phone number so I can give them a call and find out.   Hello?   Hi Ananya it is Gregory. Gregory Warner.   Oh Gregory. How are you?   I am good. I am good.   So I reached him by Skype. He told me that actually after that press conference he did get strange calls to his home and some Facebook messages from people he did not know telling him that he would better rethink what he said.   That I better line up with the current government direction. And that ...   They said you should line up with the government's priorities?   Yeah.   These messages were from the government?   It is hard to tell. It has been reported that this Ethiopian anti-terrorism task force will wage social media attacks by getting people to send messages on its behalf.   It was an anti-terrorism task force are the ones that send these kind of message.   And were they threatening?   Yeah some of them were you know insulting and that I would be punished accordingly when the time comes. And it might come one day.   A newspaper he founded got shut down after publishing one issue. And he was planning for a while to flee to Nairobi.   To secure my safety.   Leave his wife and kid behind and then maybe return grab them apply for asylum in the United States.   You know my mother and my older brother are based in U.S. Washington.   Oh okay. Washington.   Like a lot of Ethiopians he is actually got some relatives in the States.   Did they hear that you asked the question to John Kerry?   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They have heard that.   What did your mom say?   She said please do not do that. It is not good. They might be you know targeting you. Things like that. You know moms are like that eh?   Yeah moms are like that.   Yeah.     Radiolab will continue in a moment.                         Hey I am Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. Today eight experiments in translation lesson. In this one Robert Krulwich and our producer Soren Wheeler talk to writer Adam Gopnik about George Carlin.   And why is George Carlin mentioned?   Oh because Carlin is the wonderful sort of folk philosopher of language.   You are talking about the comedian George Carlin?   The comedian yeah.     It was one of his great subjects.     And all the more interesting because he was -- he did not even have a high school education. You know so it was not something that he got from schooling.   And one of Gopnik's favorite Carlin riffs and I really like this one too is about how Carlin ...   Hated euphemism.     And Carlin was wonderful about things like that. About bulls as he called it.     And he was like the reason we use euphemism. I just been through my father-in-law died four months ago. And we went through those same horrible business that we all go through in a intensive-care ward where the doctors and nurse practitioners have a language that they have been taught. We just want your father to be comfortable. He is gravely ill. He is gravely ill means he is dying right? And we want him to be comfortable means can we give him enough drugs so that he will pass out before he dies and so on. And so it is certainly true that euphemism can be a repellent thing. But no one is fooled. What were mocking is the absurdity of the effort to disguise something that you cannot disguise.   But Carlin's real point was that it like dulls our reactions to it. That it actually has like a kind of a negative effect.     And he has this whole bit. It is about shell-shock becoming PTSD.   No he goes -- no it goes -- it is in four different things.     They used to call it shell shock.     And then it became ...     Battle fatigue.     And then after it became battle fatigue then it became ...     Then it became post-traumatic shock disorder.     And then it became PTSD.     This was the Orwell notion that you could erase sensitivities if you blanded out the words. So if you stop saying Oh yeah we just tortured the guy if you say some phrase ...   Force of interrogation or enhanced interrogation.   That makes a big difference. And part of what Carlin is saying is that like now that it is PTSD we are not having the appropriate reaction to it. I mean it is fing shell-shock.     But now you are putting your finger on the -- this is where the rubber meets the road. Does the use of euphemism does that really robbed us of some understanding?   And Adam Gopnik surprisingly says maybe not.   The truth is just the opposite. We actually have more of an apparatus to help people with PTSD than they did in 1915 to help guys with shell-shock. The reason the word gets more abstract is exactly because you have a much more complicated abstract system of support. It is not because ...   Do you think that is the reason it is called PTSD is because it is a more complex and ...?   Yes because think about what that evolution says. The initial thing was oh these guys are being driven crazy because the shells are exploding all around them on the Western Front.   Gopnik says the thinking was you know it was temporary. The shell goes off. It explodes in a moment. They have a moment of shock and they need a moment of rest and then they can go back in. But by World War II we were thinking that is not quite right.   It is not just shells exploding right? It is the whole experience of battle.   It is all the shooting and the death and the fear.   So it becomes battle fatigue. You are trying to generalize it. You are trying to make it richer. That is the concept.   But it also becomes fatigue versus shock. There is less violence in that.   Right. Because it -- because you are looking at guys who may not exhibit the symptoms of shock necessarily but over time it becomes impossible for them to go on. There is a wonderful film from World War II called Let There Be Light.     About guys with what they were then calling battle fatigue. And the reason they were calling it that was because you did not necessarily see it right away.   Then around Vietnam he says we realized you do not just see this on the battlefield you see it with guys who are not necessarily directly involved in battle.   Right.   And so the question became ...   What is the source of it? It is -- you say well it is nervous exhaustion. You say the human nervous system can only take it for so long and then everybody's nervous system shuts down.   Hence the term operational exhaustion.   Now that is an example again where you are trying to enrich it. You are saying the guys are not cowards they are not in a state of shock. They are behaving the way all human beings do. And then you get more concerned about them. And you say the real problem is not their -- just their experience on the battlefield the problem is is that they are in a constant state of disorder because it lingers on long after you think it is over. You cannot just get these guys into a hospital for six months and think they are going to be better. They are permanently -- they have post-traumatic shock. And then once you have a whole apparatus to deal with it then it becomes PTSD. My point is just that it is perfectly possible that the language of euphemism grows and becomes more abstract as -- as people actually are becoming more empathetic to the people who suffer from it.   Soren do you buy -- I mean he is basically turned Carlin on his head and he is made these blander and blander words enrichments.   I have -- I mean my only move would be to hit play on Carlin.       This is Emily.   My name is Emilie Gossiaux and I am an artist.   Some of you may remember that a couple years ago we did a story about Emilie where she would been hit by a truck gone into a coma and then her boyfriend at the time Alan had brought her back by writing on her hand.   She is writing her name on the palm of my hand.   Of all the stories we have ever done I think this one has gotten the most response. And when we left that story Emilie had emerged from the coma and begun to recover. But she was blind.   Totally blind right?   Yeah.   Like no light. Nothing coming in.   No.   Okay.   Needless to say it was a very big adjustment.   I just know -- I just had to develop my own ways to navigate throughout the world and trust myself and ...   And being a visual artist she had to develop new ways to draw.   I had crayons. And if you draw with crayons hard enough you can feel the wax on the paper. Yeah.   But then one day in the summer of 2012 she gets a call.   From the Lighthouse School in New York City.   The Lighthouse School?   Yeah it is a school for the blind.   Her mom had found out that they were trying out this brand new technology.   I think they were doing this study for the FDA.   Very experimental. And her mom signed her up. Long story short Emilie shows up at the Lighthouse School one day and walks into this room and a guy named Ed gives her this thing.   He gives me the device.   Can you describe it? I mean is it a big helmet or ...   No it is not. It is just like a regular pair of sunglasses.   Though they were a little heavier than your normal sunglasses she says because right on the front like on the bridge of the nose was a little camera pointing forward.   And then attached to the sunglasses was a little wire ...   That ran out of the camera and down to this little square piece of metal.   I think it is made out of titanium and it is just like the size of a postage stamp or a little bit thicker though.   Ed explained to her that the little piece of titanium was filled with thousands of electrodes. And what was gonna happen is that the camera was gonna convert images into patterns of electricity on that little square. So he told her to take the little square ...   Place it on your tongue ...   Put it right on the center of your tongue ...   And close your mouth. So I put it on and they turned it on and it was like it started to tickle. Imagine a lot of Coca-Cola. Like a lot of bubbles on your tongue and always like prickly prickly feelings.   The idea behind this thing according to science writer Sam Kean.   Author of The Tale of the Dueling Neurosurgeons.   Is that we actually see with our brain not our eyes. I mean it might seem like our eyes are doing the seeing and our ears are doing the hearing and our fingers and the tongue are doing the tasting and the touching but that is actually not how it works. Each of our senses sends signals into the brain as electricity.   As little blips on nerves.   And it is the brain that then converts those little blips into what you perceive as a sight or a sound or a smell. Now obviously someone who is blind their retina is not sending those signals anymore. But what if there is another way to get signals for light and dark and color into our brains?   In all of our brains there are lots and lots of pathways going from every part of the brain to every other part of the brain. And normally your brain is not using those pathways even though they exist. It is like there is a road there but it is shut down and traffic cannot be on it. But ...   What if you could open up some of those routes?   He just let me sit with it on for an hour or two hours.   Emilie says at first she had no idea what was happening. She would just swivel her head around and feel the patterns on her tongue change.   And every time I looked around he would say Oh that is a chair. That is a door. That is me. That is your mom.   And it went on like this for a while. Ed showed her a ball and a square ...   A plastic banana.   And nothing was really happening for her except for the prickly feelings on her tongue. But then there was this moment.   Ed had this really long styrofoam rod and he flashed it in front of me. He moved it up and down in front of my face. And I was like Oh my God what was that?   Suddenly she says she just saw it.   I was like Oh my God! It just happened on its own.   What did it look like?   And so in my mind's eye it look like a long white skinny stick.   Could you see the texture of the stick? Or ...   No I could not see texture. I could not see in three dimensions. It was very flat. It was kind of like that kid's toy Lite-Brite?   Yeah.   So imagine like a black screen and little tiny white dots.   All arranged in a line. So Emilie was allowed to keep the brain port device for about a year-and-a-half. And during that time the Lite-Brite resolution of it did get better as her brain learned to speak tongue.   It was awesome. When I saw the people moving ...   And one of the things that really struck me in our conversation was I asked her about this video that her mom had sent me showing her wearing the device and walking down the street. And she told me that usually you know now that she is blind when she is walking down the streets of New York City ...   Especially Uptown where the streets are a lot wider.   She says people see her and her white cane and walk a really wide circle around her.   So I -- yeah I hardly ever notice other people walking around me. It feels like I am just walking alone. I can always hear the traffic and the sounds of traffic but not other people.   But she says when she put the device on and put that little sensor on her tongue the sidewalk came alive.   I thought it was amazing. Like I did not know this many people were on the street at the same time as me. And now they are all -- they are all there again.   But she described them in a way that sounded almost like a painting.   Like really soft blotches. Everything was really soft. Like soft flashes of ink that could move. They are walking and I could see their legs moving and I could see them -- their gait but I could not see them clearly. Like I could not see their features or whether they were wearing a shirt or shorts or a dress or pants. I just like see their shadows. And every now and then I see the light casted on them.   Really?   Yeah.   I imagine somehow like underwater creatures?   Uh-huh?   Squishy jellyfish-like?   Yeah. Yeah like lighting up. Yeah like that.   And that for Emilie is what it is like to translate the city with your tongue. New York City becomes this hazy sea of walking fish that make their way along in the sunshine.     Next up producer Tim Howard.   Yes. Hi. Hello. So when I heard about this story with Emilie and the brain port I immediately called up this guy.   Hey John. Which microphone? Is it this one or this one?   It is that one there.   Okay.   You might remember him.   I am David Eagleman. I am a neuroscientist at Baylor College of Medicine.   Called him up because I came across this thing that he is working on that is sort of like the next generation of crazy. It is called ...   The VEST which stands for the Variable Extrasensory Sensory Transducer. And it is a vest that you wear underneath your clothing. And this vest has 24 motors on it little vibratory motors just like the ones in your cell phone. And ...   The vest connects to your phone.   So we pick up sound ...     ... through a cellphone. And the cellphone does all the computational work to then convert that sound into patterns of vibration on the vest. And you feel a buzzing all over your torso. Bzzt. Different motors running at different amplitudes. It actually changes every 20 milliseconds so it is a moving pattern. And it might seem impossible that you could actually extract something useful about what is being said ...   But when David brings deaf volunteers into the lab and has them do a particular training on the vest he says that over the course of 12 days ...   People get really good at word recognition.   Somehow they begin to intuitively recognize that this  means Hi or Blue or Chair.   If you tried to concentrate on it and figure out how each motor translates to some part of that sound you would never figure it out. But the good news is you do not have to do consciously. The brain is a specialist at extracting statistical information.   And because the brain is so good at this kind of translation says David what he really wants to do is use this vest to create new senses.   So what if you fed in stock market data and converted that into the buzzing?   Could you develop an immediate perceptual experience of the economic movements of the planet? And would you without having any conscious awareness of how or why you are feeling a certain way could you have an intuition like You know I kind of feel like oil futures are gonna crash today.   You would not be analyzing all this information you would just feel it. We are also working on feeding in ...     Real-time weather data from the let us say 200 miles around you.   Question is would you end up having an intuition ...     ... that is better than what the weatherman can tell you on the news. Or ...   This one.   What if we took 500000 tweets per second passed it through some natural language processing to sort of have a higher-level summary of what is going on ...   ... and pump all that information through the vest.   Would you develop a sense of what is happening on the planet where you suddenly say Ooh I feel like something just happened in Nairobi. And Oh I think the Canadians have just you know finalized their election of something. And I do not know what this will be like yet but there is no reason to expect any limit on what the brain will be able to develop an immediate perceptual experience about.   More experiments in translation in a moment.     Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today experiments in translation.   For an interpreter you really do get a spectrum of life.   This is Natalie Kelly.   You know you get a little taste of all these different things that are happening in the world. It really opens your eyes.    She wrote a book called Found In Translation and years ago ...   You know I grew up in a very small town in the Midwest.   Back when she was just a kid ...   I remember going to work with my dad and there was a janitor and my dad said You know he actually speaks another language. Another language on top of English.   And she says she remembers her seven-year-old brain being like ...   Wow! There is a whole 'nother language beyond English that I could learn.   Fast forward many many years. Natalie goes to college and she just started learning languages.   Yes. Spanish Japanese Arabic German Italian whatever I could get my hands on.   Because she had this basic idea that it would just connect her to the wider world. But what it actually led to at least initially was this is very strange job.   Called telephone interpreting.   This is a job I never actually thought to think about until now. But basically when anyone calls a business and there is a language barrier the operator can call the switchboard and patch in someone like Natalie.   So I could interpret for them.   And Natalie like a lot of these telephone interpreters worked remotely. Which meant she would be in her house alone in her room and every few minutes ...   Hello. This is Interpreter 3940. How may I help you?   She would get a call. And it could be anything.   One minute you are interpreting for -- it could be a celebrity who is booking a hotel or a restaurant in Spain. And then you are interpreting for a court hearing and then you are interpreting for a hospital.   And what was the most memorable call you ever got?   I was -- well let me put it this way. I got a call. You never know where the call's gonna come from and I heard that it was a 911 call. And most of these calls are actually not real emergencies. But I knew immediately something was different. The dispatcher was connected and I heard this woman whispering on the other side of the phone. She said Me va a matar.   Me va a matar.   He is going to kill me.   Oh my God.   The dispatcher said Where is he? Donde esta? And she said Esta en la casa.   In the house?   Yeah He is in the house. And then the dispatcher said And where are you? Debajo de la cama.   What is that mean?   Under the bed.   Oh my God!   Does he have a gun? Tiene una pistola? Si. Where is he now? In the hallway. What is he doing? He is opening the door. And then click.   Oh f off. Really?   Mm-hmm. Yeah there was just a click.   That is it?   That is it. Yeah.   What sort of gets me about that is like what a weird -- like if you got into it for the connection then what a weird place to end up in where like you are by yourself in your room and then suddenly you are dropped into the middle of the most intense moment in a person's life but then ripped out before you can know who the person was or what is about to happen to them. And then you are back in your room again by yourself.   That happens. And then the phone rings again and then you are Hello. This is Interpreter 3940. How may I help you? And you are back to it and you are interpreting you know something you know literally within a minute after that phone call ends.   And the next person is probably trying to buy trading stamps in Spanish or something.   Yeah.   I cannot imagine what it would like be to have to skip and jump like that.     Okay so this next story this next translation story or maybe it is a mis-translation story I do not know. This next story actually we should say it contains a lot of obscenities. A lot of obscenities coming up. A lot of strong graphic language. If that is not something you are into or if you have got kids around I would advise you to skip forward about nine and a half minutes. All right if you are still here?   Yeah. We are rolling.   This one comes from our Executive Producer Ellen Horne.   Okay so you should start the story Ellen Horne.   Yeah. So how did -- were you at this show? Like ...   Yeah. So you guys know Nick Nuciforo who helped us arrange the tour for Radiolab?   Sure.   So he invited me to come to it.     So it is the Oddball Comedy Festival. And when we got there you know there is like huge crowds.   Tens of thousands of people kind of crowds?   Like 14000 people.   Oh my God.   Yeah. So we sat down and ...     Do you guys know Jeff Ross?   Uh-uh.   No.   He is a insults comedian. He gets up. He is the MC for the night. And he kicks the show off.     And ...     He starts picking folks out of the crowd.          D'oh!   And then he looks to his left and ...     He sees the sign language interpreter.     She looks like she is in her 50s. Brunette glasses wearing a tank top.     Stadium gives a polite clapping for Kymme.     And then he says ...         And Kymme gives a like ...   She has to -- is she translating him?   Oh yeah.   Oh God!   She cups her hand and quickly moves it up and down in the air. Gets a big laugh. And so Jeff Ross seeing this he escalates.     So to translate she has to stick her thumb in her nose.  .   Oh!   Kymme does a few signs and then makes it look like she is sticking her hand in her butt. Crowd goes wild.     So Jeff Ross takes it even further.     So now she has to do signs for like a vibrator hand crank sex.   this morning for like a half an hour. And it felt so good.   And she is having to like rub her own boobs.   I am troubled by how funny this is.     Well yeah. Because here's the thing. Halfway through the show I noticed that Kymme was not there anymore.   Hmm.   She did not translate for Sarah Silverman she did not translate for ...   Did someone else? Or was there just no translation?   No. There is no translation.   Huh.   So it made me wonder. What did I see there? What was going on? Jeff Ross was clearly using her but was Kymme okay with that?   Okay.   So I found a list of all the sign language translators in the state of New Jersey.   Hi.   Hi. How are you?   I am good. How are you?   And I found her.   Okay my name's Kymme Van Cleef and I am a certified American Sign Language interpreter. And we are here in Ocean Grove New Jersey.   Turns out that Kymme lives part of the year and -- and she has her entire life in a religious community on the beach in New Jersey.   When I am not doing comedy I am doing religious sign language. I interpret the services and I am in the choir.   And there is this venue nearby that does these big stadium shows. If there is any deaf ticket buyers the venue's required by law to provide a sign language interpreter.   So PNC called me. I do all their -- their concerts all the musical concerts which I have been doing for years. You know Goo Goo Dolls whatever. But I always can prep up for them. I get the set list I go to Lyrics.com. I always -- you know because a lot of times I do not know the Goo Goo Dolls. Yeah I like Frank Sinatra and you know hip-hop. When he asked me to do comedy I am like There is no prep for that! I did not know what was coming at me. I had no idea who any of these comedians are. Of course I went ...   Did you know any of the comedians?   No no.   Eventually I ask her about the whole Jeff Ross thing.   So he is basically having you harass yourself.   Yes.   And I am most curious to sort of find you and follow up and just find out like how that felt.   Well ...   And she says the moment Jeff Ross started getting raunchy she had a choice.   There is -- there is registers in sign language.   Registers?   Yeah. You can be formal you can be casual or you can be intimate.   And you can pick signs from all of those registers.   Like take for example the word .   Mm-hmm.   Now the polite way to do it would be to maybe spell it.   So F-U-C-K. Or ...   You know there is the regular gesture.   You could do this.   So you are giving us the finger.   Two middle fingers yeah.   You know there is quite a few.   She was just getting started.   And then there is this one that actually shows people doing the action.   She takes out two fingers on each hand and smashes them together.   There is the -- you know this way which is even more graphic.   Arms out and just pelvic thrusts.      Receiving the physical act.   Yeah. So she had a lot of options. But with Jeff Ross she figured that what was necessary was this kind of intimate graphic tone.   He was down and dirty. I was down and dirty.   So you did not have any discomfort with any of that? Or a little?   No I was having such a good time. I really -- I really was enjoying it.   So then why do you think she left?   So this never occurred to me. She was there for one girl. One deaf girl.   What? What do you mean?   So there is 14000 people there but one ticket buyer was deaf and asked for a sign language interpreter.   Just one?   Yeah. A young girl who was there with her mom.   Wow!   Did she know where this client was?   Yeah. Oh yeah. She was in that position on the stage because she was near where the client was. And so the whole time she is signing towards the client and seeing her reaction.   Can you describe what your client was doing?   She was like Oh!   Oh so I see you are holding your hand over your -- over your eyes.   She said the client -- I mean it was like a whole body cringe.   Because I think she thought she was getting a lot of attention.   Like the client was mortified. And ...   At intermission my client ...   Signed back to her. We are gonna take off.   We are gonna go home now. So I am like Okay.   So Kymme left because the client left.   Yeah.   I mean did you manage to talk to this girl?   No. I have emailed her I got the venue to call her but she has not gotten back to me.   Huh. I am suddenly feeling bad for this girl. I mean feels somehow like she got a raw deal you know?   Would you Jad -- if you had been her if you would been Kymme would you have do you think just enjoyed yourself a little less? Been little else graphic and been a little less playing with the comedian?   I think I would have dialed it down. Knowing me?   Oh my God yeah. You would have dialed it down.   He is a good man Jad Abumrad.   No but it is actually ...   Terrible translator.   No wait. Why would that make me a terrible translator? I mean this is one girl in a crowd of 14000 and the translator's there for her not the 14000.   No but remember. Think about what the job is. She came to a comedy ...   But in -- was there in any way in which Kymme had an obligation to represent the client?   No.   I think ...   She is in the middle between the two.   I think that that is -- I think it is a fair question. I think it is a fair question. I mean she is not just there to represent Jeff -- Jeff on stage.   Yes she is!   No she is there to -- to be a mutual representative of both people.   No.   Why not?   She is at a comedy show She is in the show. She is translating the show from the stage.   You match the tone of the person.   That is what Kim said.   And if they are yelling and screaming your signs are bigger your face is exaggerated. You know I made it clear the tone that he was projecting.   But I asked her like do you feel bad at all? Did you -- do you feel like you lost sight of her and you started translating for the whole crowd? Did it feel like you went behind enemy lines at all? She just said no.   If the whole audience was deaf I would have done the same thing.   Huh.   I was doing my job.   Yes. Because that is what a translator does. A translator is making what is happening up there available to me not creating a middle space.   Hmm. And I guess you could argue that if she had made the choice to finger-spell so that she protected the girl you could see that from her perspective as betraying the client because she is not giving her the full experience.   But it is weird because in her making the equal experience and her doing that she makes it an experience that the girl does not want to have.   Yeah.   Well ...   Although Kymme did tell me she could have taken it way farther.   For sure. I did not do the intimate. Oh no I did not. No I did not go there. I did it casual. Yeah casual.     Do you guys mind if in the remaining few minutes we go on a RNA fishing expedition?   Sure sure.   Because the -- here's our quandary Carl.   Okay. So what is your situation?   Okay. So recently we sat down with reporter and science writer Carl Zimmer to talk about RNA of all things. We were talking about something else and RNA came up at the end. Because here's why. Ever since we started doing this show Robert got his -- got his ...   I got a little insistent I think is what you want to say.   A little insistent because you were like RNA! We got to do RNA.   Yes. I said that. RNA.   And I was like What do you want to do? And you were like I want to do RNA. And I was like But is there a story? And you were like No.   No I did not say that. I just said that -- that if you understood what RNA does you would realize that translation is profoundly important to our existence. That is what I said.   Yeah. Well as often happens you wore me down. And I was like All right fine. Let us just try it. So when we were talking with Carl Zimmer we brought it up. Now unfortunately I think this was a day when you were out of town. I think your son was getting married.   Yes he was.   But Carl was doing like tag team work for me.   Okay. All right. So the definition of translation in biology is taking a sequence in DNA and using the genetic code to translate it into proteins.   Mm-hmm. Right.   And the discovery of this was maybe even more exciting than the discovery of the double-helix structure.   Really?   Yeah.   It was bigger than Watson and Crick?   Yeah. Well at least equivalent.   Wow!   So here's the quick story. So what happened was ...   Okay so just to set the table here. We all know that DNA is a thing and that when you are born you get half your DNA from your mom half your DNA from your dad. Now Francis Crick and James Watson just figured out the structure of DNA that basically the recipe of DNA your recipe is comprised of four bases in a long string A T C and G. That is it. But here's the problem. See like we humans we are more than DNA. We are these fleshy peeing piles of muscle and bone and all of that stuff all the stuff stuff of us comes from proteins.   Yeah. We have like a hundred thousand different proteins in our body. Different kinds of proteins.   So the question was ...   Like how -- how does all that get generated?   Like how do those four simple bases become the amino acids that become the hundreds of thousands of proteins that make us us?   How do you make the translation?   Hmm.   People were thinking of this as just this incredibly complicated problem that might never be solved. And the first person to really think seriously about this was not a geneticist it was cosmologist named George Gamow.   Huh.   And Gamow just said Wait a minute. This is not that complicated. This is just cryptography. This is a code problem.   Gamow thought Okay. I know that DNA contains four bases A T C and G. And I know that they somehow create hundreds of thousands of proteins ...   So I just need to think of a clever way of you know creating a little code machine where you put in the DNA sequence and then out comes the protein. Like what -- what simple code could I do to do that?   And just sitting there no experiments no nothing just thinking this guy Gamow decides ...   I think that our cells read our genes three bases at a time.   Like instead of AT CG AC Gamow thought maybe it is ATA CCG TCA. In other words whatever it was that was reading the DNA in the cell maybe it was reading it in triples not pairs. Because if you have sets of three rather than two Gamow figured well that'ill give -- mathematically would give you more possibilities. and that might put you on the path to making all those hundreds of thousands of proteins.   Yep.   Now this was just a guess but shortly after the double helix duo Watson and Crick ...   ... and a group of other scientists worked it all out. They figured out how you get from -- physically get from DNA into proteins.   Here's how it works sort of. Inside the cell the DNA is sitting there all coiled up. A set of molecules come along attach to it unzip it.   And make a copy of it.   This copy's now made of RNA which is like DNA. Very similar.   Still in a basic sort of four-letter format.   But it is now on the move because it pedals over to this big old factory in the cell called ...   The ribosome. It is just this -- this crazy floppy convulsive collective of molecules.   And once the RNA copy is inside this big factory another kind of RNA comes over and begins to bzzt bzzt bzzt bzzt bzzt bzzt. Read the bases three at a time. Like ...   Okay. ATA. Well that must be oh! You know GGC. Well that is gonna be ...   And it begins to create this chain of amino acids which are sort of the beginning of proteins. And eventually the ribosome will take this chain and eject it out. So that they can ...   Do their thing. You know grab oxygen or cut up your food.   Or make your hair or the cartilage in your ear your teeth or your toes or the neurons that carry the thoughts you think.   Or whatever.   It does displace the quote author of you because I mean I remember growing up thinking oh DNA is my sort of like manual or my blueprint or something. All of me is in there and that just somehow it opens and then out -- out pops me. But you are saying that there is this thing that is reading these three base pairs and forming any of a hundred thousand proteins? Suddenly. I am thinking that is where their game and not -- not the DNA but in the thing that is reading the DNA.   Well yeah. I mean DNA is just a totally meaningless molecule just flopping around unless there is a way of reading it.   But does not the build -- the reader of the DNA come from the DNA?   Sure.   See that is just weird.   Yes. So you have -- so you have genes for the parts of the ribosome.   At this point producer Tim Howard and producer Soren Wheeler stepped in.   It is like a book that births its own reader.   That is ...   That will read the book.   Not exactly though. Because that does -- you are sort of putting DNA up on that pedestal.   But it is -- sequentially it is.   Hmm?   Sequentially it is. It is first.   What is?   DNA.   How is DNA first?   Well you are saying it is -- in the order of events you begin with DNA and then after that you get the ribosome and the RNA.   Events of what?   Of you.   Okay. But -- but you got to bear in mind that you I do not know how far back you want to go with you. No seriously. Where do we start with you? Do you want to start Jad the fertilized egg?   Well sure. Yes. Yes.   Okay. Jad the fertilized egg has DNA and these ribosomes.   Oh so the readers are already present.   When a cell divides two new copies of DNA go into each new cell but they also divide up all the ribosomes from the original cell. So they are taking the factories with them.   Oh.   So the DNA is never without the code.   So it is like Moses with the tablets together right?   Can I just say I have never thought of it that way? So I might need to think about this. Right.   Well what makes the ribosomes then? Does it come from the DNA?   I thought you just said that.   Yes.   But how does it make the ribosome without the ribosome to help it make the ribosome?   What? Wait. Okay.   We need a translator in here.   You say the DNA codes for the ribosomes. So how do you make the ribosome without a ribosome to translate the code to make the ribosome?   You could not.   Wait a second. I am -- I am so confused right now.   You got to go -- you got to take the DNA and the ribosome partnership all the way back through billions of years. These two parts of the system evolved and became dependent on each other very early in the history of life.   In fact Carl says a lot of biologists think that life ...   Started out as just RNA. No DNA. And so you would basically have these little little organisms that would have these little kind of proto-genes made of RNA. And eventually these RNA molecules started to connect amino acids together to make the little building blocks of proteins.   So you are saying that people generally think RNA came first?   That is one of a couple leading hypotheses today.   Okay. So it is possible that RNA came first then DNA. And somehow suddenly I am thinking Oh we should be -- we should have been talking about RNA all along.   Well I mean just in general RNA has been incredibly neglected and ignored and ...   So the Bible instead of In the beginning was the word should have been In the beginning was the person reading the word.   Or in the beginning was the code. Yeah.   Did you guys feel the Earth shake just now? I really -- no there was some kind of vibration happening. And in my head too because I was thinking I finally get it now. Like I get it.   Good.   Because DNA got sold to us as like this is the first step in understanding the mystery of life right? But it somehow does not feel like that anymore. I am suddenly like RNA the ribosome. That is where the real mystery is!   I -- I like the way you are thinking.   And so Jad discovers that we are all translations. That translation is the true mystery. The deep secret of life.   Who invited you in here?   If I said I told you so you would not be able to translate that. Honestly.     That heroic translation from the Korean of Aura Lee is by Margaret Glaspy. So thank you Margaret.   Yeah. And thanks to all our singers. Viesta who sang Old McDonald in Bambara which is a Malian language.   Catherine McCarthy who did our Italian version of Yankee Doodle Dandy.   Leah Torres who did the German I have Been Working On The Railroad.   Azza Khalil who did the Arabic Amazing Grace and she is the mom of our intern.   Reem!   Reem yes.   And of course our puppeteer from our Apocalyptical show Miron Gusso did our Russian version of You Are My Sunshine.   Kiran Ahluwalia doing the Hindi version of Three Blind Mice.   And finally on -- with the piano and musical interpretation on everything Jon Dryden.   Thank you Jon.   Thank you Jon. Oh and you know what? If you go to our website Radiolab.org you can hear a proto-version of Radiolab in Spanish which we would like your feedback on.   Yep.   I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.             Our staff includes Ellen Horne Soren Wheeler ...                           All right. So listen the show is over right?   It is definitely ...   Totally over.   We have said goodbye.   Yeah yeah. So like anyone ...   So this is like a -- this is now -- we are not even here really.   No. This is -- this is for -- this is for the people who want to venture into some well hideous territory really. Awful territory.   Because we have -- we asked listeners to send in ...   Tell us what you think of us. Tell us -- you know like do you like us? And here's what we got.    -30-
