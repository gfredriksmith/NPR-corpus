     Dum dum dum ...  I feel like I am in an elevator or something. I feel like I am in a lobby.  Hi this is Lulu.  Hey it is Latif.  And this is the last episode of Radiolab for the year of 2021.  And it is been awow it is been a year. Like Lulu do you remember last year at this time?  Yeah there was so much burgeoning hope.     Yeah it was vaccine after vaccine after vaccine.    Anything was possible.  Sleeves were coming up. Needles were going in.   There was this moment of excitement.  Yeah. Like we can lick this thing.   And then ...  And then we did it. And now it is all solved and everything's great. It is all over. Terrific.  Not quite.  I know.  The pandemic just will not leave us.  Right. I mean some of it was not our fault. I mean some of it was our fault as a human species some of it was not our fault. But regardless as we have been looking back on this year the second one in a row that has felt like it hurt. Like it started with so much promise and we are ending with a whimper. We have realized that you know this year has been a flop. It is been a flop of a year.  Yeah. So here at Radiolab as this crappy year comes to a close we decided to pay homage to the flop itselfthis very common and yet very seldom celebrated human experience of flopping.  So without further ado we bring you   Not just one not just two but ...  Six flops.  Six flops.  Flops that are in the ocean.  Flops that are on basketball courts.   Flops that are on stage in front of millions of people.  Flops in the White House   But not in the way you think. Six flops of various shapes forms and velocities. Hoping that as we flop our way to the end of the year it might be nice to flop with others.  And it might give us a little insight into what is on the other side of a flop.  Are you in pain?  So who has our first flop?  I have it. It is me.   Hello. Who are you?  Hello. My name is Sindhu Gnanasambandan.  Welcome!  Thank you!  Whatcha got? Where are you taking us?  We are going back to the early 2000s. To this show American Idol.  Of course.  Which was one of my favorite shows growing up.  Yeah.  And you know you probably know how it is set up. It is pretty simple contestants go in front of these three judges sing a song. Sometimes they are great. Sometimes they are really not.  Yeah.  And the performance that I remember most from the show is actually one of these flop auditions. And that is the one I am gonna tell you about.  Okay.  So this flop happened in September of 2003.        This skinny Chinese guy wearing black pants and this blue short-sleeved shirt walks on stage.    Answers a few questions from the judges ...         ... and starts singing.  Talk to me tell me your name. You blow me off like it is all the same. You lit a fuse and I am ticking away like a bomb. Yeah baby.  He is bouncing around in this like kind of awkward way. You can tell he is trying to dance but it is not really working.  She bangs. She bangs. Oh baby when she moves she moves I go crazy. 'ecause she looks like a fly but she stings like a bee.  And eventually ...   The judges cut him off.    And for some reason this flop by this guy William Hung more than any other flop in maybe the history of the whole show it went viral.  Talk to me tell me your name.  There is an SNL sketch about it.   People made parodies ...   ... making fun of his voice.   His accent.   Even his teeth.   What did you think of all this when you saw it happening?  I mean I was just a kid. I probably just laughed with everyone else but you know watching it now it really just makes me sad.  What is sad about it?  I mean I think why he was so laughed at was because he sort of fit this like nerdy Asian stereotype.  Yeah.  And like I grew up in this place that was filled with people who were Asian American and you know just like a very immigrant community.  Yeah.  And as an immigrant watching TV and like especially a show like American Idol it is sort of this way to answer this question of like how am I supposed to be here? Like what is liked like what is good what is lovable?  Totally.  Mm.  I feel that so hard. Yeah.  And American Idol is the cleanest version of that because you literally get someone just like going and being themselves and then three people being like That was good. I liked this I like what you are wearing. I like how you talk. I hate this!  I do not like this.  Yeah exactly.  That is so funny because it is like an American Idol it is like your American paragon of what it is to be an American.  Right. Right. And you know William Hung ...  Did not fit the part.  Right. He did not fit. And you know I thought when this whole thing happened you know when America essentially told him William Hung you do not belong I thought he would just like disappear. But he sorta did the opposite of that.     Which was so strange to me.  Talk to me ...   Like he goes on all these big talk shows and performs She Bangs in malls concerts sports games.  Like a bomb. Yeah baby.  He does the halftime show at a Golden State Warriors game a concert at the Rose Bowl with Janet Jackson and Maroon 5.  Oh my God!  It is like he is reliving the nightmare of that American Idol audition over and over and over again.  Yeah.  And I justlike I never would have done that. You know I was the kind of kid who if I got one answer wrong in class I would not want to go back the next day. And this guy was like going back to school jumping on the desk and just like shouting the wrong answer again and again and again. It is like he is immune to being humiliated.  Yeah.  And I have always wondered like how? How did he manage to respond this way? So ...  William how is it going?  Good!  I called him up.  Just a moment let me fix my background.  Yeah sure.  He is 39 years old now. Lives in Jacksonville Florida with a friend.  Okay.  After the whole American Idol thing he tried to become a high school teacher but that did not quite work out. And now he is a professional poker player.  Did you just make your bed?  Yeah.      I asked him how he ended up auditioning for American Idol. And he said it is not like he grew up wanting to be a performer. He moved to the US from Hong Kong when he was 10 and had a really hard time fitting in.  You could say that I am more of a loner. My best friends were my teachers.  He got bullied in middle school.  Probably just because I am Chinese or Asian because I was the only Asian in my class.  And college was not much easier.  I did not know how to make friends socially.  But then one day he is walking into his dorm and this poster catches his eye.  A picture of a guy with a microphone the red curtains behind it.  And it is this poster for this talent show that his dorm's holding. And he decides on a whim to sign himself up.  It is like a new opportunity.  He used to love doing karaoke with his parents.  The way I saw it was I had nothing to lose.  He chooses Ricky Martin's She Bangs.  I just tried to mimic Ricky Martin's dance moves.  Practices.  So like She bangs she bangs.   And when he gets on stage ...  I see people were dancing with me. They were so excited. And then at the end people were giving me loud cheers and applause. Like Yay! Woo!  And he ends up actually winning the whole show.  Wow.  Whoa!  I was like What? Really?   Yeah he wins a DVD player.  Nice.  So thatso it is one of those nights that you feel like you were on top of the world.  Later that week he is watching Fox News which he watches every night and he sees an advertisement for auditions for American Idol.  I was like Wow maybe there is an opportunity there.  And you know he is still like riding off the high of like winning this school talent show.  Right.  I could win big right? Nobody knows.  And he is like You know what? This is the next step. I am gonna sign myself up.  Hell of a next step yeah.  And you both saw how this went. Though ...  It was so weird and funny. Like Randy would hold this white sheet of paper.  It is interesting to hear William recount what happened.  And then Simon was like frowning like this and was like crossing his arms.   He seems ...  No. Well that is the surprise of the century.  Almost amused.  I know I did not do well on the audition. You know I was nervous my movements were very jerky. If you use the standards saying good it was not good but I could live with it. It is okay.   Tell me more about your emotions of that day.  And we talked about all of it. You know the jokes people made about him ...  Did you at any point feel humiliated?  The big performances of She Bangs.  I was just excited.  And when I asked him about people making fun of him ...  I kind of just like one ear in one ear out.   But that does not hurt you? That does not hurt your feelings?  No. They want to laugh at me that is fine. Because they enjoy watching or listening to songs you know to my style of She Bangs whatever.  Hmm. But I wonder if you can talk about even one specific moment that either was painful or humiliating or like angering to you.  I really do not have that Sindhu. And that is a good thing. There were some interesting experiences for sure but it was not like anger. How to say it? It is not so impactful that I had to think about it every day.  Hmm. Yeah. Yeah it is just amazing because humiliation is a really hard feeling for most people and it definitely is for me. And you know I fear it a lot. And that is one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is because it seems like you are sort of impervious to it or that you are able to perform some type of alchemy to turn it into ...    I was asking him in all these different ways and I was really starting to feel like he was somehow immune until ...  Through all of this did you ever cry?  ... I asked him this.  No.  Not once?  Nope. Not for American Idol no.  Hmm. What is something that has made you cry?  Ooh.  Very hard. Very hard. There were a few moments that made me cry. I remember one day I spent a lot of time after teaching preparing the next lesson.  This was after the Idol stuff settled down. He was training to become a teacher.  The next day I was like Okay these things will go well. I was optimistic. But then you know the kids just decided not to follow me. You know they saw me more like a funny entertainer a celebrity. They did not see me as their teacher. And then my master teacher called me out and Step aside. Like I am taking over da da da da right? It was notit was not a good scene. It wasit was an embarrassing scene to me. So yeah. And then he told me he would fail me if I do not improve. I cried after I got home because that really hurts. That is not a fun thing to hear.  Yeah.  It felt real you know? That is like Oh my gosh. I did all this and you say this is not good enough? Okay. I felt that was biga bigger embarrassment compared to my American Idol flop.  Why did that feel like a bigger flop to you?  Because I worked so hard to get to where I was. I was ready to graduate. I seriously considered taking on a high school teaching position after I was done. But after that experience that changed my mind. It is like Okay I do not want to go through this ever again.  Hmm. Yeah. I mean I guess that makes sense that that feels more like a flop because I guess with a flop you need to have a ton of expectation and hope and you know you have to care a lot. And then you have that crushed with like a huge disappointment like a total failure. And I guess this experience you had as a teacher does fit that definition way better.  Yeah I agree.  But the thing is like for me there is like one more component to the definition which is like the audience. Like the group of people who are watching you fail.  Yeah. Yeah.  And to me like that is almost everything. Like it would matter so much to me that American Idol was in front of millions of people. But you do not seem to weight that component very much. And I just likewhy do you think that is?  Well like I mentioned for my American Idol audition I just focused on having fun enjoying the moment. And that is it.  Yeah. But well I guess another way to ask this like so the story we are making right now together it is actually like the first ever story where my voice will be like a big part of it.  Oh!  You know millions of people will be listening to this. And that is really scary to me. Like you know I guess I am asking you all of this from a place kind of of wanting to learn from you how do you not let the fear of judgment from all those peopleand really for you notI mean not just the fear of it but like the actual judgmenthow do you not let that totally crush you?  Ooh I like this one. So I would say I choose to embrace my identity. I choose to embrace my past my present my future. It is a choice. Like I do notI feel like I am not the norm of whatever. Whatever that means. Like back then I was not the norm. Now I am still not the norm and that is okay.  Did you find that helpful?  I mean kind of? I do not know. I think what I realized is that what he did to this question and kind of all my questions ...  Yeah.  Is he sort of just rejects them.  Yeah.  And I think it is because these questions kind of assume that what the judges or the audience like the people out there you know America they assume that what America thinks matters.  Mm.  Yeah.  And I do not know. I just do not think that is how he operates.  I pay my dues. Time after time. I have done my sentence.  And I feel like every time I listen to one of his tracks ...  I have made mistakes.  He is actually made some albums which I have kind of been listening to a lot. It sort of reminds me that William Hung is a way to be in this world.  But I have come through.  To go on and on and on and on and on.  We are the champions my friends.  Producer Sindhu Gnanasambandan. When we come back way more flops. Aquatic flops Olympic flops NBA flops. More flops. A lot more flops.  We are the champions. We are the champions. No time for losers because we are the champions of the world.  Next flop comes to us from editors Soren Wheeler and Alex Neason.  All right Neason. You there?  Yeah I am here.  Did you have like a hot start that you had in your head? Or should I just kinda get us kicking?  I mean I have some stuff that I want Latif and Lulu to watch.  Ooh!  Hmm.  Oh okay. That'ill be ...  But you can go. But go. Let us go.  Ready ready ready?  Okay. Yeah so ...   So I guess I would say that this one is about the flop as a lie told through the physical movement of bodies.   On the basketball court.   Okay.  Wait wait wait. Do you guys even know what a flop is in basketball?  A flop? No I do not think ...  So ...  You wanna school 'em Alex?  Yeah. Let us just like show you ...   ... what we are even talking about. So this is a clip of Marcus Smart guard for the Boston Celtics. He comes to the basket for a rebound ...   And ...   Oh man!  That was extreme.  He seems to like bounce off the Atlanta player does this flailing pirouette out of bounds.  Yeah.  It is like he decided to do a high jump in the middle of a game or something.  Yeah.  So that is a flop. It is when there was not a foul or sometimes any contact at all but the player falls and flails dramatically to try and get the ref to think there was a foul.  Oh!  Yeah it is like putting on a show. Like Ow! He got me! You know like Oh my God he pushed me over!  I feel like I know of this in soccer but I did not know that it was a thing in basketball.  Yeah.  Yeah. No it is a thing in basketball too for sure. It always has been.  Yeah. But right around 2012 or so ...   ... it seemed to be sweeping the NBA like some kind of plague.   At that time ...     The flops were just getting like especially flagrant and people were tired of seeing them.   In part because it looks stupid but also ...   ... because people thought it was bad for the game.   That it is disgusting cheating.   And it needed to be stopped.   But then along came a guy named ...   Mark Cuban.   The guy from Shark Tank. And he is desperate to put an end to the madness.  And he also happens to be a billionaire and owns the Dallas Mavericks.  Yes well ...  I have to say in my head I imagine like a limo rolling up on your lab.  No. Mark Cuban just emailed me. That is how it started.  So this is Peter Weyand. He is a biomechanics researcher at Southern Methodist University.  So you just opened your email one day and it was just like Mark Cuban.  Yeah one evening I was like Oh! And I showed it to my wife and was like Does she think this is really Mark Cuban?    And she said Yeah I think it is. You should probably answer that.  That is funny.  And basically he says Look this flopping stuff is getting out of control.  He was concerned about the integrity of the game.  You know we got all these big huge guys that are sort of falling over all the time and flailing. And so I am gonna throw you a bunch of money and you are gonna prove scientifically that these guys are flopping.   So sadly since I am a Shark Tank fan I have never met Mark Cuban and ...  That is Ken Clark. At the time he was a graduate student in Peter's lab. And so he and Peter got together thought about it and they were like All right!  This'ill be fun.  We have the equipment we have the tools so let us do it.  Absolutely.  All right. So what did you do?  We crashed into each other over and over and over again.  We played human billiards.  Yeah exactly.  The idea was if they could figure out what a normal non-floppy collision looked like well then they could spot when something fishy was happening. So ...  We set up big crash pads in the lab.  They would bring people in. They put like the little sensor things on them.  We have a motion capture system.  They got the cameras and they just have people run into each other.  Well to do that ...  Smack smack smack.  In a whole variety of ways.  Oh my!  Subjects of different sizes.  Like a little guy runs into a big guy.  With different incoming velocities.  You try it really fast now you go really slow or you just push on 'em.  Well what are you doing today? Oh we are just putting on some you know video game suits and running into each other the whole day. Yeah.  They even built a metal and plastic person. They called it Gus.  Gus he was just a galvanized structure with a piece of plywood in the middle.  To like knock him over.  I wanted to put a San Antonio Spurs jersey on Gus but the members of the crew said no that is pushing it too far.    So they do all these tests and here's what they come up with guys falling on their butts all the time that is not actually a reliable sign of a flop at all. If a player has their feet planted and their weight on their heels or whatever it does not take much force to knock them over.  Right.  It is not much. It is not much at all. If they do not move their feet bam over they go.  Yeah. Absolutely.  Huh!  So that is gonna actually happen a lot in the natural course of a game. But the thing you need to watch according to Peter and Ken is the arms.  All of the excessive upper body motion.  The histrionics yeah.  Yeah the histrionics really.  The natural reaction when you are hit and falling backwards is for you to take your arms and reach backwards to brace for impact. And so if a player's flailing with their arms above their head all crazy   Nine times out of 10 ...  ... that is probably a flop.  ... they are putting on a show.  The problem is even that does not really help much because a guy could actually get fouled and sort of flail his arms just to like draw attention to it.  Right. So they write this whole report up. They even made like a video and they gave it back to Mark Cuban. And this was not what Mark Cuban wanted to hear.  He was hoping for moresomething more concrete and actionable to sort of stamp out this epidemic of faking. But you know we cannot change the science.  So this whole experiment was itself kind of a flop?   Well I mean yeah. Maybe a little bit. But the interesting thing was that Peter and Ken told us that a scientific hard science spot-the-flop kind of thing actually might be possible in the not-too-distant future.  It is not far-fetched to think that we could have instantaneous velocity on all 10 players on a basketball court at any given time.  And all you would need is just like a tiny little bit of math.  You know their mass you know mass and velocity you know instantaneous momentum. You go off some basic assumptions that momentum in a collision's gonna be conserved.  Then you just have computers that are sort of tracking and crunching all those numbers.  Based on the sizes and velocities incoming and outgoing.  And if there is more momentum coming out of that than going in ...  You just send a little signal down to the ref right there on the court.  Beep beep. You know bell goes off in the ref's earpiece and says Hey that was a flop!  Then just like . A big old like X. Like that was fake.    Yeah and then they just put it on the big screen right?  Yeah.  Like Family Feud when you get it wrong.  Yeah.  Right. That is right.   To think that someone like Mark Cuban would spend his infinite amount of dollars to find out the core cause of flopping instead of why his team cannot win a championship again seems to be a bit of a waste of money do not you think?  Okay so after talking to Peter and Ken about what they did we were kinda letting ourselves imagineat least in theorythe game without flops. So we decided to put this idea in front of my friend Tyler Tynes. He is a sports writer at GQ and I was like Tyler like what do you think?  I do not think anyone in this country if they have any sense about themselves would look at you in your face sit down and tell you they enjoy flopping. But flopping is part of the game. It has always been part of the game.  And he was kinda squishy on this.  Well I think the thing where I come from is that flopping by nature is sucker shit. It is naturally detestable.  So he hates flops but at the same time part of the beauty of the game for him is just letting players play it however they are gonna play it.  And so the issue actually is not with players the issue is with the league that incentivizes this type of entertainment. So if Trae Young or Draymond Green or Marcus Smart flails a bit differently than maybe some of our heroes of old the reality here is that it makes money when you flop. The teams are better if you flop and you can get a three-point shot.  We have incentivized sports in America to be like win win win win win by any means necessary but flopping is by any means necessary.  And so is the core of this actually the players?  Well but ifyou could decide whether the system is gonna incentivize a flop or not right?  For sure.  You could change the system so it does not incentivize it. And I am just kinda curious like would you rather see a game with no flopping?  No.  And actually we heard the same thing ...  No. It just does not feel right to me you know having grown up playing basketball.  From both Peter Weyand and Ken Clark.  No I do not think so. Not in my mind.  I do not like adding police officers to the sports that I watch. You know what I mean? Like we have changed how we talk about basketball and flopping and the policing of flopping is a part of that where the waylike how you identify who a basketball fan is now has changed. Who enjoys basketball? Who runs these teams? Who now are the presidents of these front offices?  These are white kids who wanted to be Michael Jordan Allen Iverson and never could. And now they have the cultural cache and the power to say what is important within our athletics. And it is how we get to something as serious and non-serious as flopping. Where it should be just a part of the art form. It should just be fun. But instead it is become policed. Now you are a bad player if you flop. Now you do not care about the art of basketball if you flop. Now even for someone like me I am calling these people out they name because they flop right? It is not the trueness of how we believe basketball is supposed to be played. And so to me at least the issue is that why do not you just care if these boys is playing basketball or not?  I hear you.     It is interesting because when I came intowhen we started working on this story my feeling about flopping was pretty much centered around James Harden notorious flopper. And he would look so smug about it and it would just grind my gears and I would just be so incensed by it. So when we started working on this it was really a moment for me to sit and think about like what kind of basketball game I actually want. And so I arrive at this place where I am like flopping just feels like it is just part of the theater and the drama of like what makes watching a game so exhilarating.  Watching James Harden ...  Oh my God.  ... figure out how to be an insurance salesman with these flops.    It was kind of magical because you knew he was going into the game and had no care about the rules of the game. And that level of anarchy that level of just self-assuredness and that you were going to break the game in some respects? That was cool. And so my thing is that I do not care if you flop. It is a part of how you are gonna get over in this game. I as not gonna say I respect the thing though.         Hello?  Hello-lo-lo-lo.  Hi.  Hey everybody's here.  Next producer Matt Kielty and contributing editor Heather Radke.  Yeah so whatwhat do you guys have?  I actually feel like this is gonna be close to Lulu's heart. I have been thinking about Lulu the whole time.  Hmm. Really? Ooh okay.  It is about a ragtag group of women making their way in the world today.  I already hate it. I do not know. I already hate it.   Latif is out.  I am just kidding.  All right so ...  So we are gonna take you back to 2001.  To a group of ragtag young women.  Total ragtag.  One of whom was Kate.  Kate Darmody Burke.  So how do you want me to ...?  However you want.  Ashley.  I will go with Ashley Gersuk Murphy.  I am Shelby Chlopak.  And Shelby.  Oh gosh. I screwed that up.  So Kate Ashley Shelby.  And all three of them were lacrosse players. Okay so lacrosse. It is like sticks with little nets. You throw a ball around.  Uh-huh.   Okay. So all of them had finished high school and they all wanted to play lacrosse in college. But you know they were not gonna play at like ...  Lacrosse nation.  University of Virginia or    University of Maryland.   These very storied programs.  They were not getting recruited by these top schools.  They kind of figured they would just like play at some small school stay somewhere near home.  Yep. Well so insert Kelly Amonte Hiller. You could call the Mia Hamm of women's lacrosse.  Two time player of the year.  National champion at Maryland.  She came to one of my soccer games.  She was going around the East Coast trying to recruit women to come play for her at Northwestern University.  But the problem was Northwestern did not even actually have a team.  Yeah. Because Northwestern it is in the heart of the Midwest just outside of Chicago. And back then lacrosse was not a Midwest sport. It was an East Coast mid-Atlantic thing.  But Northwestern had hired this like first-time head coach to basically build a program from scratch.  She was like 26. Oh you are like a little kid!  But when she went recruiting she would ask these girls point blank ...  Do you want to be a national champion? And we are sort of like I mean ...  What?  I remember giggling and laughing but there was no smile on her face.  I thought this lady is crazyI love her.  So she managed to get a team together.  Just picture a lot of really intense short East Coast ladies making their way to the Midwest.   She was pulling people from everywhere.  She got these twins who she found on the street just jogging.  Asked them if they wanted to play lacrosse. They thought lacrosse was a town in Wisconsin.  They do not even have a practice field.  They practiced on the flag football field.  But early on she sat them down and she said to them ...  We will be national champions. And we need everybody to buy in. You know I say Jump you say How high?  She had us boxing and doing yoga and meditating.  They did these things called affirmation circles.  And we would go around and tell each other positive things about us. You know Oh you are so fast Jenny. Your shot is so strong Ashley.  And Kate told us ...  We drank the Kool-Aid. She told us we could do anything and we really just believed her.  And so that year this group of mostly freshmen hit the fieldand they lost a lot of games. They go five and 10.  Five and 10. Five wins. 10 losses.  Five wins. 10 losses.  Yeah.  It is pretty bad. Their second year they go 8 and 8.  Ooh!  Oh!  Third year they go 15 and 3.  Ooh!  Which means they made it to the playoffs but they ultimately lost in the quarters to UVA.  I went to UVA so I could be go Hoos!  But then their senior year they go undefeated.  Whoo-hoo!  Ooh!  And they actually make it to the national championship game where they have to play UVA again.  Are you building up a Mighty Ducks here? But then they get to the finals and blow it?  Quack quack quack.  Like is that the flop?  No no no. They win.   They win. They win the championship. The bench clears.  What?   They are like hugging crying jumping laughing.  I mean it was the most incredible. You know I now have two children and that is pretty incredible but truthfully the most incredible experience of my life. We went nuts.  And then I will never forget being in the locker room and Kelly talking about just how proud she was and then we get to go to the White House.  Which is where the story sort of flips.  It is July 2005. They go to DC they get all dressed up and they go to the White House.  It smelled and felt distinguished. You know it is the White House.  They get to see Lincoln's bedroom they walk around the Rose Garden.  And then they get ushered into this room where in the corner ...  There is almost stadium seating kind of bleachers.  So the whole team goes over takes their place. And then in walks George W. Bush.  He is got on a suit and tie.  Comes over congratulates the team. They give him a couple lacrosse sticks.  And then some photographer says ...  Okay everyone look up here.  Three two one snap. A few days later Shelby gets a call on her cell phone.  That I did not recognize the phone number. And I picked it up and it happened to be some reporter. I do not really recall from where. And then she was asking me you know just different questions about winning a championship and going to the White House. And then all of a sudden it took a turn because she said something of Did anyone say anything about your foot attire? I said Excuse me?  And the reporter went on to say Well in the White House photo you were clearly wearing flip flops.  And that could be considered disrespectful or inappropriate. And I am like Whoa whoa whoa whoa. I am sorry I have to go.  She hangs up. And she is like Oh God!  Because she was not the only one who was wearing flip flops that day.  No.  Kate was one of them.  My cell phone starts ringing at five in the morning.  It was a reporter asking her about her flip flops.  She says a day later ...  The story broke.  First it was in the Chicago Tribune.  Then USA Today.  White House flip flops flap.  NBC.  White House footwear fans flip flop kerfluffle.  ESPN.  NPR.  CBS.   Kate and Shelby were on The Today Show.   And their mothers are on the show.  The mothers are on the show the coach. And then a ...  ... shoe expert.   Saying that we should have been wearing a full-heeled closed-toe shoe.    All because of this photo where a few young women are wearing flip flops.  Wait actually can you show me the picture?  Yeah hang on. Or maybe just Google.  Okay hold on I am just searching lacrosse White House flip flops.  Are you searching?  Okay.  You will see the picture.  I see the picture.  It is a totally innocuous ...  Such an innocuous picture. It is like such a generic photo op photo of the president holding two lacrosse sticks. And then all these women.  But look at their feet Latif.  But it is just soit is just so nothing.  Oh is it Latif? Is it really nothing?  Yeah. It seems so nothing.  Have you considered ...  Wait do you guys as humans Matt and Heather do you actually think it matters? Really?  What do you mean? Matters in what sense?  Well to Latif just being like Ugh who cares?  I do notI do not think it matters. Like I do not think they should have been shamed for wearing flip flops at the White House. But I think it very much matters that these things happened because it tells us something about us.  Yeah and so to that point we ended up calling up ...  Oh Alexis is back.  I am back.  Oh Alexis is back.  Hi!  Hi!  This presidential historian Alexis Coe.  Because as we kept reporting on the story and trying to answer Latif's question why does this matter? We kept coming back to the scene of the crime The White House.  If we just go back. Let us go back to like the earlylike the formation of the White House.  When Washington first took office the White House was an idea that they would get to.  So at first when Washington was president he lived ...  In New York.  And then in Philadelphia.  But he knew that there needed to be a permanent residence for the President.  A presidential house as they would call it.  And his big thing was whatever they end up building ...  ... there can be no markings of monarchical rule.  Like no gilded doors and a big arched gateway.  He was like I am Mr. President.  Right.  It is not a presidential palace.  Because the idea is that the government the democracy is supposed to be of the people by the people for the people.  But Washington was in a tricky situation because he liked the finer things in life. He liked sumptuous fabric plush suits purple carriages.  The example Alexis gave us that is like excellent for this very thing is for his inauguration ...  He orders a simple home-spun brown suit. But if you look down at his shoes he is wearing diamonds.  What?  Shoes with diamonds on them.  No!  What?  He is wearing diamond buckles.  Wow G.W.  And so under Washington what we ultimately end up with for a president's home is definitely not a palace but it is alsoI mean it is a mansion. When it was built it was the biggest house in all of DC.  It is like a conflicted confused space all the way through.  Mm.  You know the White House is built by enslaved people. The first handful of presidents besides Adams are all slave-owners. They are like fancy Southerners who are trying to like figure out how to also be democratic which is like these are like the primordial problems of American democracy. Like who gets to be inside of it and who is not inside of it? It is like all the stuff that is kind of like baked into the formation of the country is also baked into the formation of the White House.  And so this is where it gets kinda fascinating because for example both the House and the Senate have rules for dress code. Like they have dress codes they have rules for decorum. Like the White House does not have anything that is codified.  Interesting.  And so what the White House becomes is this space where in each administration they can sort of dictate what the White House ought to be and kind of like demonstrate what they think our country should be.  You know it is played out in like what Christmas trees the First Lady chooses and how you know ...  Yeah. I was immediately thinking about that. Melania's trees.  Yeah. And there is likeyou know George Bush banned blue jeans in the White House but Obama would let staff workers work without their suit jackets on. Like all these questions of formality and taste are really questions about like what is the White House and in some sense like who is America?  Hmm.  And the lacrosse players when they flopped onto the floor of the White House they were kind of unwittingly walking right into the middle of this question.  You know there was not a set of rules where it felt like we were doing something wrong.  That is Kate again.  I had no idea until my brother was the one that yelled at me.   I mean they thought they were wearing nice shoes.  Yeah you know the more I reflect on it ...  Shelby again.  I wonder if anyone would have even thought twice about what a men's team wore on their feet.  And I think one of my favorite things about this whole thing is that when these women went on The Today Show ...   When they were basically asked to appear on national television to apologize for having worn flip flops to the White House this ragtag group of women who had won this national championship against all odds they walked up onto the stage at NBC's Studio 1A in New York City wearing matching ...  ... matching flip flops.   day Show No? No? You wanna think about that ladies?  And that was you did that on purpose. That was sort of like ...  Oh absolutely. Absolutely.  All right. Okay. So next up we are going to a place where flip flops are not only allowed they are celebrated.  Okay.  The pool.  Fun.  Fun is not exactly the word I would use to describe this story. It is ait is kind of a story of an ethical conundrum. That is how I would put it. And it involves an Olympian a global pandemic andbecause I roped him into it our colleague David Gebel.    Oh and a flop too.  All right.  Latif calls me and he said Have you ever heard of Greg Louganis? And I said I am a gay man who is 64. Of course I have heard of him!   Okay so we are talking about the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.   Greg Louganis is both a platform and springboard diver. And at the prior Olympics he would gold medalled in both.   Going into the 1988 Olympic Games I was the favorite.  That is Greg.  And then in the prelimsfortunately it was prelims ...  Something Greg never expected to happen happened.  Yeah.   Greg has done eight dives. He steps up to the board for his ninth dive.  Wait. I feel like I need a visual. What does he look like then?  Oh my gosh. He is like Hollywood handsome.    Wavy dark hair. Fit body like the Calvin Klein ads in Times Square. And you can see his concentration. Like the whole world falls away but the whole world was actually watching him.  And then ...  I got set.  Takes three steps.  Jumped up off the board.  About six feet up in the air swings his legs over his head starts a back flip goes around once twice ...  And then I heard this big hollow thud and I go crashing into the water.   You see people sitting in the stands and their hands are over their mouths in shock.  I was thinking what the hell is that? And then I realized that was my head.    Kind of amazingly he just pops up out of the water.  Yeah and he swims to the edge of the pool.  I made my way over to my coach Ron O'Brien.  And the coach is pushing the blood up into his dark hair so that the blood running down his neck is not showing.  Turns out he split open his scalp at the back of his head. So he walks away from the pool.  Gets brought back into a training room.   And they stitch him up.   The first emotion that I felt was I was embarrassed. And of course the world's watching.  But there was one thing the world did not see and that is actually what drew me to this story because inside this very public moment this very public flop was a secret that Greg would not actually reveal until years later.     So when Greg finally reveals his status to the world in 1995 it was huge.   He was on all the shows. He was on Oprah.   Sally Jesse Raphael.   And in these interviews these same questions or kinds of questions keep coming up.   On Larry King.    And then once you knew you had it and you were going to the Olympics Barbara Walters asked why did not you tell anybody?       Greg told Barbara that he had told his coach but almost nobody else. Because like if he wasif he was HIV positive he was not allowed in the country. That would have been ahe probably would have been barred from the Olympics. He probably would have been ...  Wait wait wait. He was in Seoul but heif he had disclosed his status he would not have been allowed?  Yep.  Wow.  There was a list of countries that had it announced You may not enter the country if you test HIV positive.  Right.  And if he had announced it while he is there he would have been sent home immediately.  But Barbara Walters just kept asking him.    I watched that going Stop beating this guy up for 10 minutes of his life.  Yeah. I mean it is hard to watch. And I think even then like people mostly knew that HIV could not even be transmitted that way.  Mm-hmm.  Like the pool was so big the water was chlorinated. You know so it doesthere is part of it that does feel like it is just like everyone ganging up on the gay guy.  Mm-hmm.  But there isI do not know. There is one part of it that feels like a fair question to me and that is like when I think about the doctor right? The guy who was stitching up Greg's head he was not wearing latex gloves and so he was stitching him up. Like if he had pricked his finger with that needle hehe could have contracted HIV.  Hmm.  To me that moment thatthat is very morally complicated.  Yeah one of my fears was you know well what is my responsibility knowing that I am HIV positive?  Yeah. Was that like a ? Like was that like alike alike alike a ...?  No. It just is. It is like whatwhat do I do? What iswhat is the next right step?  Did you know the doctor was not wearing gloves?  I did not see it. I had my face down and I did not have eyes on the top of my head. And that is just it you do not know what you do not know. You are dealing with this situation in that moment.  What is yourlike just walk me through your internal monologue.  Well you know the thing is I mean one thing that I learned just through practice through my years and years and years of performing is always asking myself What do I have control of? Usually not much. Okay there were no latex gloves. Okay that is not in my control. And so it is basically letting it go.  After we talked to Greg I justlike I kept thinking like he ishe is right. There is nothing he could have done about the accident nothing he could have done about the doctor not wearing gloves. But I did keep thinking like he did have control over whether or not he told the guy.  Yeah but you are making it sound so simple. Put yourself in his shoes. Put yourself in his Speedo.      And think about what just happened all that is at stake.  Right.  You know when he came out as HIV-positive and gay I am relieved and feeling like I am not the only one who is thinking about this kind of thing. I think me and HIV-positive people around the worldbecause I tested positive in '87 a little earlier than he did.  Okay.  And I got this job to sing at Tokyo Disneyland and I needed this job really badly. And I was very familiar with that list of countries that you are forbidden to enter. And Japan is on there too. And I am coming into Narita Airport outside Tokyo in this very formal very polite English but Japanese thought kind of sign. It says Hello. If you are HIV positive please step over here and register. And I remember walking under that going You have gotta be kidding me. I am not saying a word. So when I am hearing Latif go back about What were you thinking at the moment well you kind of think about that moment every day of I am in the kitchen and I am having dinner with friends and I cut myself and what do I do? I am not gonna announce to everyone I am HIV-positive but I am gonna make sure I clean it up run it under water get it bandaged up and have my heart stop pounding. So to zoom in on Did you make the right choice in that moment when you are getting stitched up? is an understandable question but I mean think about all the secrets you gotta keep because you have to keep them.  The part of that that I likeyeah that I like really had not considered was this feeling that it is like this one moment however you know highly public it was it was just like one moment in a string of so many moments like this.  Yeah.  So I guess to end the story of this moment what happened next?   Okay. So Greg finishes getting stitched up and he goes to talk to his coach.  He said You know you can pack up you do not have to get back on the board.  We could just go home.  But I was in fifth place. I turned to my coach and you know said that we have worked too long and hard. He said okay.  They are not gonna go home. They are gonna keep going.   So he gets back on the board.   I heard an audible gasp from the audience.  I remember watching it and I just held my breath for you to take that next dive.  Yep. Yeah because you did not know what was gonna happen right?  Oh.  I did not know what was gonna happen either. But it is the Olympic Games.   First dive? Nails it.  It was the highest-scoring dive of the Olympic Games.  Does the next dive.   And he is going to the finals.   Right.  Next night in the finals he wins gold in the springboard. And then ...   He is up for gold on the platform.   A dive takes less than three seconds.   Coming up two more flops. One into the water and one out of it.  Lulu. Radiolab. That was me flopping. It is a flop show. Flop show! All right. Our next flop comes to us from ...  Flippity floppity.  Okay.  Flippity flop.  Yeah. Producer Rachael Cusick.  Okay I am gonna start this by telling you about a time when I did not flop but I wished I had.  Oh the flop that got away!  Exactly.  All right Rach. Please explain.  Okay so last summer I was in Utah with a friend and it was just brutally hot.  It was so hot that we were in a parking lot and the temperature read 114 degrees.  That is my friend who I was with. Her name is Tamar. And Tamar being Tamar she went onto Google and found a public pool for us to go to. So we drove a few towns over put on our bathing suits and walked out on the deck.  And it is clearly like the place to be on a day like today. Pool noodles slapping the water and like all this laughter.  And the centerpiece of it all was the diving board. Now Tamar is like immediately giddy.  These are my people the people at the diving board.  She leaves me behind and gets in line with ...  A range of six year olds to 12 year olds.  She got onto the highest diving board and jumped. And she just looked so happy. Like so perfectly carefree. But that is not how I felt at all.  Why?  Growing up I just was the one in my family who was the heaviest and in my friends who was the heaviest. And so as I grew up the pool was where I was at my most vulnerable. Like there was not any hiding from clothes. And so I kind of trained myself to be as small as I possibly could at the pool. So that day in Utah I am at a crowded pool of strangers and I am like How can I get myself in that pool as fast as possible but also like as quietly as possible?  I am like looking at the pool searching for the corner furthest away from the eyes at the diving board. Like the cool lifeguards they were off to the left. I gotta like stay away from them. Meanwhile I was 25 years old. I am like a great person. Like I should not be strategizing away from the lifeguard in the bucket hat but that is where we were that day.  And then I see that there is like awkward kids in the corner. So I head their way. I looked both ways to make sure no one's watching me and then slowly carefully like I am putting a potato into a pot of boiling water I slink my body into the pool.  So it is just disappear?  Totally.  You know this entire time Rach just so you know were just kind of like bathing with all of your body submerged except for your shoulders and your head.   It was like an alligator.  You looked kind of like justnot sad but just let down. I feel like almost you shut down in a way.  And she was right. Like I felt defeated like a kid who got bullied by myself.  Yeah that is not good. That is not good.  It was not good! Soso that was what happened back in July. And then this flop show comes along and pretty much the minute we get this prompt ...   I turned on YouTube and started binging videos ...   ... of belly flops. And I was spending hours doing this.    I watched people who were giving tutorials.   I learned that the Norwegians have a national sport dedicated to the belly flop. I ...   ... became ...   ... obsessed with the belly flop. And I did not even know why. Like I am staring at these videos of belly flops the way that you stare at your fridge when you are really hungry and you do not even know what you need to eat. But then I watched this one video. It is of these manta rays that jump out of the water and then they like kind of sail and then they plop down like a pancake.   These manta rays and their belly flops they are the opposite of me in that pool last summer. And watching them I was like I want someone to teach me to do that.  All right after you folks.  Okay.  Here we go!  And so ...  All right.  Okay let us go change. We will see you in a minute.  Yep.  Annie McEwen and I ...  You never know where life will take you.  ... drive up to Boston and belly flop with the ultimate belly-flopper.  I am Chris Miller. I amI am Lulu Miller's father.  And I think that is why I am here but it is true that I have been belly-flopping for about 70 years.  As I know you guys were like We need someone. And I was like I have got a real B-lister. Like he is got no plans. And it is one of his only interests.   Oh it smells like a pool.  Oh it smells great.  I do not even need my own towel.  So the three of us meet up at a hotel pool.  Should we test the water temperature?  Oh I am sure it is gonna beoh it is a bath.  We are out on the deck and even though it was November the pool was empty. Like no one was there. I still felt that feeling from the summer lurking.  I am afraid to like even try.  But honestly the minute that feeling bubbled up for me Lulu your dad was like ...  Do you want to have a demonstration first?  Oh can you demonstrate to start?  All right. It is just a matter of starting to dive but not arching.  And he just kind of ...   ... flings ...  Oh my God!  Oh my God!  ... his body.  No way! That was the most impressive thing I have ever seen!  And it just isit is dazzling.  That kind of looked awful.  And then it was my turn.  Oh God am I gonnaoh this feels like big leagues.  So I kind of stand like a plank with my feet at the edge of the pool in the deep end.  Now do not bend your knees.  Chris is coaching me from inside the pool.  You do not have to control anything on your body. You just do it.  Then I kind of surrender to gravity and then just let my head ...  Oh my God. Oh my God!  ... get carried down.  Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!  Yes! Yes!   And the first thing I heard when I popped my head out of the water was ...  That was perfect!  ... Chris cheering me on. And so there was this weird tension between like pure pride and ...  That hurt my head a little bit.  ... pain.  Do you not get like a smack in the face?  You get a smack in the head. You know there is always a price for pleasure.  But soon the pleasure of the flop outweighed the pain of it.  One two ...   That felt like a little not painful enough.  And so I just kept flopping.  Okay. All right.  Uh-oh. Whoa. Whoa whoa whoa whoa!   Oh my God that was amazing!  Oh my gosh!  Do that again quick before ...  Okay.  Go go go go go!  How many times did you belly flop?  I would say at least like ...  One two three. Whee!  Yeah!  15 to 20.  Okay that was good.  What does your body feel like right now?  My body feels like it is been smacked by like one giant palm.  Yep that isyou know and that means you are doing it right.  Every time I would emerge being like that was the most painful thing that is ever happened.  Your chest is getting a little red there.  Oh yeah.  Try again.  Whee!   Oh!   Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!  Oh my God.  But we would do it again.   And again.  Oh shit!  And again.  But now you can do this with running.  I understand less and less.  Meanwhile Annie's standing on the side being like I have no idea what is going on.  It is the worst! Ahh! You guys are masochists!  But it did not matter because it felt like I was making up for all the years I did not get in the pool that way.  One two three ...  Go!   And I was feeling freer.  You are a hero!  Eventually I became one with the flop. And Chris and I took on the pool just like the manta rays.  Should we do a double flop? Okay.  One two three. Ahh!   Good job!  And when I emerged from that last flop I feltat least in that momenttriumph. But also the worst headache I have ever had in my life.   Oh God!  Yeah I think there is gotta be a PSA announcement at some point.  My entire front of my body is popped blood vessels. Like my legs are still blue.    Oh my God!  Yeah.  Oh my God!  I like called my doctor the other day and I had to like have the most shameful intro on the phone to be like So I was like repeatedly belly flopping on Monday night and I just want to know like do you think I need to come in for a scan? But I think it is okay. She thinks it is fine. And I just need to take it easy the next few days.  All right. Thank you Rach. Thank you Dad. I think. And for our final flop I am gonna flop us right on out of the water onto land. It is time ...  What does that mean?  I mean it is time to look at a fish flopping around awkwardly on landa fish flop.  Okay.  Okay? All right. So you know this is kind of ...  I do notI do not think I have ever seen this before.  Really?  No I do not think I have seen that.  Okay. Well allow me to conjure it for you. Picture a beautiful scaled creature lying on a dock trying to move. Heaving up and flopping down. And heaving up and flopping down. Getting nowhere you know?  Like a last gasp kind of thing.  Exactly.  Mm-hmm.  And I think since the first time I saw it its just been burned into my brain as the saddest most pathetic movement in nature. However a few weeks ago ...   Rolling on up on the Shedd Aquarium.  ... I met someone who watches fish flopping ...  Thank you for bearing with me.  ... almost every day.  Great to meet you.  Yes you too. I know!  And she completely reframed how I see it.  My name is Rachel Zak and I am a senior aquarist on the special exhibits team at the Shedd Aquarium.  Oh. Hello turtle!  So Rachel walked me around all these massive tanks of clownfish and sharks.  And I will show you the ribbon eels.  Sea dragons and pufferfish.  He looks like a grumpy frog.  And first of all she explained that every species of fish has its own little distinctive flop.  Would an eel flop? Or would it just like wriggle like a snake?  Oh no theythey flop.  And the thing that really holds them all together is that none of them none of these flops are what she would call pathetic. In fact when she sees a fish flop she thinks ...  That is an awesome behavior! That is exactly what they are supposed to do.  ... it is part of how they survive.  Flopping is effective. Like a fish that you drop on a pier flops enough to make its way to the end of the pier.  I mean there is an achievement there. So there is a realthere is skill. There is technique. There is just a ton of power.  It is just flailing right? Like how much technique is there?  Well the voice you just heard is Alice Gibb a biologist at Northern Arizona University who for the last decade has been filming fish flopping on desks in her lab.  So let me tell you about flops.  Yeah.  She filmed all different kinds of species and when she played the videos back in slo-mo and watched what is really going on inside that motion she saw that the fish is doing something that seems impossible.  Have you ever watched somebody dribble a basketball and they start it flat on the ground and they tap it just gently? And if you tap it and tap it and tap it you can start the ball bouncing up and down in bigger and bigger and bigger arcs.  So the fish somehow ...  ... bounces itself.  And at a certain point they kind of jerk up onto their tail.  It is almost perpendicular to the ground at this point.  And then they launch forward often into the water.  Wow!  Fish did not learn to flop because we dropped them on decks right? Fish learned to flop for many different reasons.  Grunion which is a kind of fish actually flops out of the water for their babies' sake. So they will like flop up onto the sand lay eggs so underwater creatures cannot get them and then flop back down into the water.  They are rock stars.  Or there are other fish ...  Killifish.  That flop because they live in these tiny little pools and sometimes there might only be one in a tide pool.  And the males they need to find females to breed with.  And they will just kind of flop like 10 times the length of their body into another pool.  Hmm.  In a human-centered world when people talk about I flopped down on the couch or something seems to imply maybe an uncoordinated movement that then is followed by no movement at all.  Yeah.  Right? Like it sort of implies that you have hit a dead end.  Yeah.  But that is not what is going on with the fish on land right? Because even the flops which I think are called flops because they appear uncoordinated they have the ability to maybe take something that could be a dead end and turn it into another chance.  But like a fish flopping back into the water like how often could that possibly work?  Okay well probably not that often.    But sometimes! But not that much.  Yeah. But you knowwell the thing it makes me of ...  Mm-hmm?  Is like when you think about us like we were ocean creatures at the beginning before we became land creatures. And for us to have gotten to the land at all ever like that was probably the first way it happened. Like we are only possible because of fish flops. That there was this moment there was this pivotal fish flop without which we would not exist.  Boom.  Right?  Yeah. Yeah that is beautiful. We do not need to say anymore.  Okay.  All right. That'ill do it!
