     It is like -- yeah anyhow.   So what have you been up to?   Annie do you need a microphone?   Uh I think we are going to share 'ecause what else are we gonna do? It is good. It is fine.   Annie's gonna have to sort of strike like a viper.   Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   And I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab.   I will go like this.   Yes.   As long as youre comfortable with that.   And today ...   A story about when things from far far away ...   Let us combine our heads.   Hit very close to home.   Just put your hand on his forehead.   I will.   Or over my mouth. That is fine.    Comes to us from producers Simon Adler ...   Buh buh buh buh bum!   And Annie McEwen.   Buh buh buh buh bum!   Okay.   Okay. So you are gonna tell us something about something?   You you have put ...   Should -- should I start us?   Yeah yeah.   You start.   Okay. So we have been exploring what happened on May 18th 2003 in the great city of Brussels.   Hmm.   Specifically in Schaerbeek.   Schaerbeek.   Schaerbeek. One of the municipalities in Brussels.   Story starts with this guy.   So it was -- it was around 30 pm. And I was with one of my colleagues at a restaurant to have one of the good meals of the day.   This is Emmanuel.   Emmanuel Willems. I am the -- the one everybody calls when shit hits the fan. Yeah let us put it that way.    And that evening Emmanuel along with much of the rest of the country was waiting around for that day's national election results.   The results for all the different parliamentary assemblies.   But Emmanuel's mind with on something else. Because across the country that day millions of people had just voted on computers. Belgium was in the early days of experimenting with electronic voting and so instead of filling in a paper ballot in the voting booth was a touch-screen computer and voters would walk in insert this white credit card-sized card into the machine and then vote by selecting names on that screen. And it was Emmanuel's job to make sure that all these hundreds of computers worked properly.   Mm-hmm. I am an IT guy. So something like that.   And at that point at 30 at night after the polls had closed ...   Besides the usual computer glitches ...   It seemed like everything had gone well.   And so we were -- there were two of us.   He and one of his fellow IT guys.   Waiting for the others I guess to talk about the day.   Pat each other on the back for a job well done.   And that is when the ...     That is when his phone rang.   It was unexpected. And it was one of the officials of the ministry. They said that they had a problem that they had detected a problem in Schaerbeek. And so I say Okay we are coming over.     And so you pay the -- the check you hop in the car and ...   I hope we paid the check!   We dashed out of there.   We just did not leave like that.   Fifteen minutes later ...   They arrive. They get out of their black Escalades as I like to imagine and they -- they enter the polling station.    The townhouse of Schaerbeek.   This ornate building with big tall ceilings.   It is a very old building.   Filled with this crowd of confused-looking people.     Well they explained to us that going through the numbers they noticed one of the contestants ...   This relatively unknown Communist Party candidate Maria Vindevoghel.   Had a very high number of votes from this one polling station.   Okay.   And taking a closer look they noticed that the number of votes for this contestant was impossible.   Wait. Impossible?   Yeah. A mathematical impossibility.   Essentially she received more votes than there were voters who could possibly vote for her.   Hmm.   And so as Emmanuel's hearing this ...   I am curious. Is this just a fluke? Is there an explanation?   Fraud.   You are thinking fraud?   I am smelling fraud.   It could have been tampering. It could have been a bug. It could have been a hardware glitch. It could have been uh ...   It could be anything.   Yeah absolutely.   So first things first they got all of the ballots. Those white plastic magnetic cards that the voters had loaded their votes onto.   And recounted. Reinserting every single magnetic card one by one.   This took several hours. So now it is like 30 in the morning. And they print out the new recounted report hold it up against the old one ...   And they are the exact same results for every single contestant to the vote except the contestant which had had this abnormal number of votes.   This time around Maria had far fewer votes.   And at that point one of my colleagues did the math and said the difference between the number of votes she had in the first count and the number of votes she had in the second count it is exactly 4096 votes.   She had 4096 fewer votes.   Hmm.   Does that mean anything to you?   4096? No it means nothing to me.   Well ...   4096 is not a random number.     It is a -- it is something about this number. This ...   Well tell us!   I do not know -- I do not know the answer but I have this -- a deep sense. I am feeling tingly.   So if you guys were IT people and you heard the number 4096 you would be like Great Scott!   Would we?   Yes you would.    Yeah absolutely. To every IT guy in the room the number 4096 was -- was very meaningful.   In fact it was a clue. A clue to a cosmic culprit capable ...   Instead of ...   ... of voting systems being hacked ...   Of swinging our elections ...   Have switched votes ...   She said I cannot slow down.   Crashing our cars ...   Runaway Toyotas. Taking off on their own ...   And reminding us just how small and at the mercy of the universe we really are.     So wait. So why -- why is 4096 so important?   Okay well to explain I would like to back up to the morning of the election.   Okay.   So polls open and at some point someone slid their white card through that card reader. And Maria Vindevoghel received her first vote.   It registers vote number one for Maria.   Yeah. Now when that happened inside the computer in its memory a zero switched to a one.   Okay.   And I mean that both in terms of her vote total and also in how a computer counts.   The way a computer works is that everything is stored in memory. And memory is binary. It is either a zero or a one. Either on or off.   Zero is off and one is on. And -- and I think we all know this right? Or we have heard that at least that deep down computers are zeros and ones.   Sure yeah. Yeah yeah.   And so in this specific case what that means is all these individual votes that Maria would get throughout the day they all were stored as just ones. As these individual ones.   Okay.   Now when you are limited to counting with just ones a way to do it is to tally like you do in groups of five on a chalkboard.   Right. Diagonal line.   Diagonal line.   Bundling it.   Yeah exactly. But when that tally starts to get high it becomes incredibly inefficient to count that way. So instead to save time energy and computing power computers do a little bit of math. They -- they count using powers of two.   Powers of two. Mm-hmm.   You remember powers of two?   Maybe?   Something squared is a power of two.   Exactly. Two squared or two to the second power two times two is four. Two to the third power two times two times two is eight. Two to the fourth 16. Et cetera et cetera et cetera.   So how is it that a computer is doing that?   Right. Well so to help you visualize this imagine inside a computer's memory there is this string of 13 light bulbs. Light bulbs that IT people call bits. Each one representing a different power of two. Just stick with me here for a second.   Yeah okay.   So that first light bulb represents ...   Two to the power up zero.   Which is one. Because anything to the zero power equals one.   Okay.   Do not ask. Math.   Second light bulb ...   Two to the first power.   Which is two. The third bulb ...   Two to the second power.   Or two times two.   Four.   Four.   Et cetera et cetera et cetera. Now when Maria received her first vote a little bit of electricity was sent to that first light bulb.   Two to the power of zero.   Turning it on.   Two to the zero is one.   Exactly. Now when she got her second vote this time some electricity was sent to that second bulb.   Two to the first power.   Turning it on representing two votes. And because two votes are stored in that second light bulb what -- what the computer does simultaneously is turn off that first bulb. So to be clear when she got her second vote the first bulb was turned off and the second bulb which represents two to the power of one was turned on. So it is now only using one bulb to represent two votes.   Oh okay!   Now in order to represent numbers that are not powers of two all the computer does is turn on multiple bulbs at once.   A sequence of power of twos.   For example when Maria got her third it turned on the first and second light bulb.   Two to the first power.   Because ...   One plus two equals ...   Three. When she got her fourth it turned off the first and second light bulb and turned on the third.   Two to the second power.   Fifth vote turns on the first and third.   Two to the power of zero two to the second power.   When she got say her 17th vote it turned on the fifth bulb.   Two to the fourth power.   16 plus the first bulb.   Two to the power of zero.   One. equaling 17. And so on and so on adding up these powers of two.   And with that respect 4096 is a power of two.   I see! So that number is one that they are like blink!   Is that what that is?   Yeah. It is the 13th bit of memory. Which meant that ...   At some point during that day something somehow turned that bit on. It flipped what should have been a zero to a one.   Yeah. It was -- it was a binary flip.   Your mind just went there immediately.   Oh yeah absolutely. Yeah.    I love that you -- all the IT people are like Oh! And all the non-IT people are like What is going on?   What what what?    Well to each his trade.   Yeah.   Well okay so you know that it was just one bit that flipped. What does that make you ...   No we knew -- so we knew that the result could be traced back to the 13th bit flipping. What we did not know was what caused the bit to flip.   Okay. So what would -- that is your next question what -- what could cause this bit to flip?   No idea.    What were the options? What did you ...   Well it could have been -- it could have been any number of things. And so we each -- in the following days we got access to absolutely everything.   First thing they checked ...   It could have been the software. So we carried out random tests on the source code.   Looking for any bugs that that could have caused this bit to flip.   But there was nothing major. So we were fairly confident that it was not a software error.   Okay. So if it is not software it is hardware right?   Well we got the machine that was actually used in that polling station on the day of the election.   The computer that had done all that tallying and counting. And they ran a bunch of memory tests on it.   Memory testing to see if something came up.   To see if some defect in the physical memory could have caused this bit to flip.   What came back on that front?   Nothing. Not a single error. So the memory on that computer was working fine.   Well so what the heck are you left with?   Not much.     As far as we were concerned this one computer had had a glitch which caused it to give a wrong answer.   But is not that sort of an unsatisfying answer?   That is the way things go. You know we just simply had no proof of what caused the bit to flip. We just do not know. That is the way it -- it turned out.   And so over the next couple of days Emmanuel and his team sat down to write up these findings. Half-expecting that once finished this report would be filed away and never mentioned again. However ...   Hello? Hello? Brussels can you hear us?   Hi is that Simon? It is Natalie here in Brussels. How are you?   That was not the case.   I have your guest here. Armed with plenty of tea. I am just going to let her have a seat and have a chat with you.   Thank you.   Yeah thank you Natalie.   No worries. Okay.   Merci. Hello?   Hello? Uh is this Zoe?   Yeah yeah. It is me.   Hello Zoe.   Hello. Hi.   All thanks to this lady.   Danke. I am Zoe Genot. I am member of the parliament.   And back in 2003 young and freshly elected to parliament ...   I was 28 or 29.   Like half the age of most of the MPs.   Yeah. It is that.   She was generally aware of what went down in Schaerbeek. That there was this computer problem. Someone got some extra votes.   It was really strange. And for me it was really a concern because our most concern is that the people can trust the electronic system. And with this -- these sort of problem we are not sure the people can trust the system. So we waited for the report of the specialist.   And finally about three weeks after the election it came out.   Yeah. We only -- well we ended up writing that at some point during the day the 13th bit had flipped.   Hmm.   That is all we wrote. Basically.   It means nothing. It means nothing.   Well then that -- that is what she is thinking.   No no. No no. There -- there must be more. Nobody can understand this sort of vocabulary. And I was confused with the explanation.   Because way down at the bottom of the report in the final paragraph the only thing they said about a possible cause was and I quote This phenomenon is extensively described in the specialized literature.   Yes we did write that.   And what -- what were you referring to there?   Nothing in particular.   I said What is this? Why they not explain what is really happening?   So Zoe went to her fellow parliamentarians and was like ...   There was a problem. We do not know what really happened.   Like we have got to look into this.   What can we check? Who can check? Who will check? But the people the older member of the parliament they say Oh yeah. Zoe Genot she is there with the strange style. And she is there speaking about problems.   Basically forget about it.     It is done. We are elected. The election are gone. There was no problem. But I said No no. We must find out what was really the problems and speak about it.   So Zoe contacted me and she did send me the paper report.   She reaches -- she reaches out to this guy named David Glaude. He is a member of a group called   Our name is Poureva. And we are fighting for ethics into electronic voting.   He hates electronic voting.   Basically we are against voting machine. Yes.   But interestingly he is also like a hot shot IT guy works for the European Parliament.   Yeah. And as an IT people I tell you do not trust us. And do not put everything in our hands.   Anyhow Zoe had known him for a long time and so she reached out and asked Can you help me understand what are these random bit inversions? Like what is this?   So the report? I read it and I said Hey wait. I did computer science studies and bits are not flipping. What are they talking about? So I -- I needed to find out. So I guess I started to Google to ask what could explain this.   Initially he came across some articles or blog posts arguing that these sort of things could always be traced back to some software bug.   But they did not find a bug so they -- they blame it on something else.   Not totally satisfied he tried some new search terms.   Blah blah blah. Bit flipping.   And came across a couple articles that made this strange claim.   They said the cosmic ray could flip a bit of memory.   Wait what?   So they said yes. If the cosmic ray touched your computer the right way at the right spot it could change a bit from zero to one.   Gamma rays aimed at Belgium in favor of a particular Walloon!   We are not gonna be able to use any of this tape.    No this is great!   Well so you are saying that what created this effect in Belgium on that day was a zing from deep space?   That was the theory that David came across.   And my first reaction was to say Ha ha ha! Cosmic ray. Hey what a joke! But then it become a bit bizarre because I found out about ...     Some IBM research.     An IBM paper from the '70s. And in it ...     They made a lot of studies about random bit flipping and problem with computer memory.   The report explained how in the '60s NASA had noticed these random bit flips in their satellites.   Ooh.   And then more recently how IBM itself ...     ... had studied their computers at higher altitudes.   So closer to a space let us say.   Closer to the sky.   Closer to God.   And they found out that there were more bit flipping up there than at the sea level.   Hmm.   And the only explanation they could come up with for -- for what could be causing this was -- was cosmic rays.   Yes. When they investigated they found out that it could have been cosmic rays causing problems.   I said Oh okay.   Okay.   Because cosmic rays essentially are charged particle and so electronic systems can get affected.   This by the way is Professor Bharat.   Bharat Bhuva. I am a professor at Vanderbilt University in electrical engineering and computer science department.   And while Bharat was not involved in that specific IBM paper he has essentially dedicated his life to studying the effects of cosmic rays.   So we started noticing on the surface of the Earth this problem started around 2001-2002 time frame.   Recently!   Right. And they held big ramifications.   Is this a thing people that know about? I mean is this like a ...   Well yeah.   Because this is the first time I hear of it.   Well its ...   Um.   I dont know if we should continue on the story or go into cosmic ray land.   Yeah what do you want? Do you want narrative or do you want cosmic ray land?   Ooh. I love that thats a choice we get to decide. Im torn.   Well I dont know. Maybe just go with the story. I dont know.   I think we dive into -- we give some of this.   Okay.   Okay.   Oh yeah.   Okay so according to Bharat to understand what happened that day in Belgium we have to go back to a long time ago. Wait for it -- in a galaxy far far away.     I am going to generalize way too much.   No no! That is good that is good.   Way too much.   Bharat says in this distant galaxy there was a very very old star that exploded.   And when the star explodes it sends out a huge amount of material.   All sorts of little tiny charged particles.   These charged particles are thrown into space. And these particles are going to travel through space for millions of light years.   Uh Simon?   Right. Sorry. These particles are passing through other galaxies.   They get deflected they get trapped. Going around suns the gravitational pools ...   Until finally on May 18th 2003 one of these particles ...   With lots and lots of energy ...   Enters our solar system. And not long after that ...   Comes into the atmosphere ...   And crashes into an earthly atmospheric particle. And in that moment ...   Energy's transferred to the atmospheric particle.   Essentially it hands it a little bit of energy causing that newly energized atmospheric particle to start descending towards Earth.   That is correct.   But on its way down it smacks into a couple other particles passing some of that energy on again. Causing those particles to fall and crash into other particles. And this happens again and again as these particles and this cosmic energy catapult towards the surface of the Earth.   And so you get this cascade. It is a shower of all these particles. From the top it would look like a Christmas tree.   Now down at sea level ...     Down on the surface ...     The electronic system that was counting the votes in Belgium zooming along humming along you know in its own way.   Two to the sixth power.   Tallying the votes by turning on those light bulbs. Now the switch that turns on those light bulbs is called a transistor.   The transistor turns on or off. And that creates binary ones and zeroes.   When its on it sends out a little electricity switching on a bulb. But the thing is these transistors can be tricked into turning on. So imagine ...   Suddenly this particle from outer space ...   Comes zooming down and enters that voting machine hitting precisely the transistor that controls that 13th bit.   And that instant ...   The transistor is tricked and sends out a burst of electricity to that 13th position.   Two to the twelfth power.   And the bit flipped.   A zero was changed to a one and from the heavens those 4096 votes appeared.   Yeah what -- what?   Again David Glaude.   I do not know. I mean it is like if I talk about cosmic ray on one side I am afraid that people will take me for somebody crazy. But wait you can read it too if you Google those words you will find a lot of scientific stuff talking about that.   And so not long after David and Zoe met up and David told her what he would found. That -- that its possible -- who knows -- but its possible that the vote was changed by the cosmos.   I -- a cosmic ray got down in the computer and it make a mistake. I say It is not possible. You are really sure?   I have got no clue if that is the true explanation or not. And there is no way to prove that it is a cosmic ray. But I mean its the only thing which matched the explanation.   I said Oh no! I will never can explain that in the Parliament. Theyre all going to laugh!   Aware of all of this at the next session of parliament ...   I decide to ask a question to the new minister who was responsible for the election.   So the session gets underway. And eventually the agenda turns to Zoe. Now theres no audio recording of this session. But based on transcripts it went something like this. She walks up to the podium at the front of the chamber and begins.      She summarized what had happened in Schaerbeek.      And then explained what David had told her.   That this bit inversion it is cosmic ray who caused a problem in a computer.     The room was there joking ha ha ha. Zoe Genot come here with the little green men.   Ha ha! Zoe what a dumb dumb!   And the minister ...   He say Yeah yeah. Do not worry. It was a small error somewhere. But we see here there is no problem with the result of the election.   With that the minister sort of motioned to move on but before her time could expire ...      Zoe jumped back in and basically said Wait a second. Think about what this could mean. If this is true like can we trust these machines?   So I asked Are you sure there was no other cosmic ray somewhere who changed some of the result of the election? And the minister ...   After pausing for a moment.   Admits he was not sure. And when the minister say Yeah perhaps there are other problems we do not know there was a strange silence. And nobody can laugh anymore.   Democracy and stars do not get along apparently. Ipso facto dingo dango.   I think someone here needs to hold the skepticism. Ill be the skeptic.   You be the skeptic.   What is -- what are the odds? Supposing this is the truth.   Well the odds are apparently like ...   Theres no question that this does happen that a cosmic ray can hit a computer and goof things up.   I mean the only thing I can is that ...   I mean even Emmanuel will concede that.   Yeah. Cosmic radiation can have an effect on electronic computers.   And Bharat and his team have actually synthesized this happening.   If we suspect a bit flip we will actually put the computer in a linear accelerator. Usually its a cyclotron.   Which is basically this mini controlled supernova.   Pretty close to it. Its all magic to me. But what they do is in cyclotrons they can get you the ...   They put the computer in this concrete bunker point the particle beam at it ...   The electronic system's working we drag all the wires out of the room. Then there are a few buttons to push three two one the light comes on alarm sounds. Beam time.   It is called beam time?   That is correct.   Oh wow that is great!   That is so great!   They blast the computer with these tiny particles.   A million particles per second.   Just like those cosmic rays flying through space. And as this is happening Bharat says ...   You can sit there and watch the bit flips.   And given this fact what Zoe was really asking was ...   If the extra vote were not 4096 but the small bit flipping then would you notice?   Like what if a candidate just got 32 extra votes and that invisibly changed an outcome?   That -- yeah that is the point. I mean it is only when the computer produced an impossible result that you can tell that there was something wrong. And -- and we call that the tip of the iceberg.   You want us to just throw to break or do you guys want to come in and -- and toss.   Let us hear what you do and then we will come in and ruin it.   Classic. Music swell music swell music swell and we are like so buckle up. When we come back we are driving full steam ahead into that iceberg to figure out just how deep it goes.   Ooh!   What an interesting metaphor!   That is a mixed metaphor.   You are gonna drive a car into an iceberg.   You can drive a boat!   Love it!   Oh my! You have to ask Mrs. Vanderbilt your third-grade teacher to go back to the metaphor section of the lesson. In the next hour.         Okay. Ready?   Jad.   Robert.   Simon.   Annie.   Radiolab.   So all right. So we just heard that a single cosmic ray from deep space flipped a particular election result. I guess the next question is like you know is this happening all the time? Some of the time?   Yeah.   Well if you mean like how often do those charged particles hit Earth?   Every day every second we are bombarded by these particles.   Quite often. Because it turns out these cosmic rays ...     Theyre coming.   They are?   Yep.     Right now right through your body you are getting thousands of these particles going through.   Wha...? And ...   And even if you are inside a building you are still going to get all those particles because most of these particles just cannot be stopped. They just go through anything and everything.   So Bharat seems pretty sure of himself.   Yes yes yes.   But Simon and I were like Wait. We gotta see this for ourselves.   Is there -- we should turn off that screen because we gotta make it dark in here.   And apparently although these particles are just too small to be seen with the naked eye ...   We are currently in the studio blacking the place out.   Bharat did tell us theres something we can build. Something called a cloud chamber which is basically just an upside down cup you fill with vapor.   Yes.   That might let us see the trails these particles leave behind.   If you can make one that would be really really good.     Now it turns out theres a lot of YouTube videos showing you how to do this.     One starring a kid who looks about four years old.     So ...   Okay so ...   We thought we had a pretty good chance of making it work.   Whoa! It is cold!   Yeah be careful.   It is cold!   We got dry ice cast iron pan.   From my kitchen.   Flipped it over.   Okay we are now putting the cast iron over the chunks of dry ice.    Thats the sound of the metal cooling down .   Wow!   The most beautiful ...   That was amazing! The metal pan was singing. It was such a pure tone.   Good job metal pan!   Next take a see-through plastic cup.   A 24-ouncer.   Some felt. Our felt is purple.   Its like if Prince had a little bit more red in his purple.   Stick that felt in the bottom of the cup. Hold it in place with some magnets on either side of the felt.   Magnets Jad.   Soak that felt in rubbing alcohol.   What do you think? Soaked?   That seems pretty thoroughly soaked.   Turn the cup upside down onto the now very cold cast iron pan and seal it in place with modeling clay. Overhead lights off flashlight on. Aim it at the base of the cup and then wait.   Lets watch for it.   How is this thing gonna work? What are we gonna -- what are we trying to see here?   So what were looking for what should happen is that that cold metal is going to make the alcohol vapor condense and like turn into a cloud.   So you are gonna make a cloud.   Yes.   Kind of foggy looking in there. Thats what you want right?   And through that cloud what we are hoping to see are these tiny little particles shooting through. And we will not be able to see the particle itself but we will be able to see the trail they leave behind.   Oh!   And it is supposed to be very similar to the trail that an airplane leaves behind in the sky.   A contrail those things are.   A contrail exactly. So -- so what we are hoping to see is these like tiny little airplanes with their tiny little contrails inside this cloud.   And that will be evidence of these very particles?   Exactly.   So all three of us are on our knees in the studio. Pitch black at the moment. The only light is emitting from a headlamp on Annies head.   But ...   Maybe its one of those like watched pot never boils things.   Nothing happened.   I dont think theres enough fog in there yet.   Come on little particles!   After about an hour of this ...     Pulling up YouTube on our phones.   I am so jealous of this four year old.   I know.   To check our scientific method.   I dont know.   Jad and Simon had to get back to work.   Good luck.   They had things to do.   Okay Ill be back in ten minutes.   Okay.   I stayed behind just in case.   Why isnt it working?   Alone in the dark with a little beam of light.     Oh! What was that? Come on do it again.  Oh! I saw one! I saw one!   You saw one?   Yeah. Simon!   What did it look like?   Like a tiny little ...   These very very tiny white thin thin threads ...   There! Did you see that?   Yep.  Materialize.   There. There. Im seeing a bunch of them.   Really?   Wait. Where?   Suspended in the cloud. Holding their shape for just a moment.    Oh theres one. Theres a lot ...   Oh wow!   Wow!   Before disappearing.     Oh whoa!   What was that?   Once we started seeing them ...   Ooh theyre just like -- theyre like little daggers.   We couldnt not see them.   Phooom!   Whoa!   A couple big ones there.   Theres like three there.   That one's coming right through me.   Wow!   Okay I can now tell you -- not just because someone told me but because I saw it for myself these things are definitely real and there are definitely a lot of them. And so I guess the next obvious question is like if we know they are here besides that voting booth in Belgium like what else are they messing with?   Like has my phone ever -- are the -- is the probability such that my phone has likely been goofed by a bit flip caused by a cosmic ray?   Absolutely. So all of our computers all of our systems are getting bit flips on a daily basis.   Okay.   For example the routers that we have on the internet.   Did parts of the internet get shut off by these things?   Yeah. Routinely.   What?   Even today.   Whoa whoa whoa whoa!   Yes. People just assume that Oh my internet went down for five minutes. All the internet companies like Cisco Systems theyre very keenly aware of this problem.   Apparently in the early-2000s Google's indexing system was down for five months.   No kidding!   What else has been goofed by these?   A lot of manufacturing plants have been goofed by this.   Really?   There is a custom manufacturing plant which made custom machines and one of the bits flipped so they were making things wrong. So ...   Wait what -- whats a real example of that?   Not sure I can discuss this on the air.   Oh really?   Yes.   Can you say what -- so what kind of machine?   Not sure I can say this.      Sorry.   Something that Bharat was able to tell us is that the higher up you are in our atmosphere ...   The number of particles with higher energy is higher.   And that means the chances of a bit flip are also higher.     The electronics in airplane is always bombarded by these particles. And one time the plane is flying its on autopilot. And suddenly one of the bit flips that takes it out of the autopilot.   What?   Yes.   Who -- who -- what airplane? Where?     This was a Qantas Air flight in about 2008.     Jesus!   Oh my God!   So it essentially dropped like a rock.   And it was all because of one bit flipping.   Wait.   Which they believed was caused by a cosmic ray.   Wait. It just -- it just nosedived for a thousand feet and people like hit their heads on the ceiling?   Something that was on just turned off and there was nobody ...   Yeah.   Oh my God!   Whoa!   Because of a bit flip.   Holy shit!   Now we should say that like even though bit flips are happening frequently the vast majority of those flips ...   They are benign.   We dont even notice them flipping.   Those bit flips matter only if its right there at the right position. So for example in that parliament the bit flipped. But that bit flip mattered only if they were taking a vote at that time and actually tallying the votes.   So the likelihood of a bit flip having any consequence at all?   Its rare.   Okay.   Hello. This message is for either Grover or Barbara.   And thats what made this next thing Bharat told us ...     This is a strange call to receive Im sure.   ... even crazier.   Im sorry I didnt answer the phone initially. Im just tired of people who want to reduce my credit card interest or give me something for my pain or ...   This is Barbara Walten. We reached her in Boiling Springs North Carolina.   Little one stoplight town.   Where she lives with her husband Grover.   Weve been here since we got married 53 years ago.   Were hoping to be able to understand like what it was like to be in one of those cars.   Oh my gosh. Oh!   Do you mind just like telling me what you were doing the morning of the accident?   No. We live in North Carolina. We have a son that lives on the coast in South Carolina so we were going to visit.   Its about a four-and-a-half hour drive. Takes you through some pretty good-sized towns.   The area we were in was more or less a rural area.   Theyre driving a 2008 Prius. Grover is behind the wheel.   And I was in the backseat because I was on my computer and I didnt like to do that in the front seat because of the possibility of the airbag coming out and throwing the computer in my face.   And what were you -- if I can ask what were you doing on your computer in the backseat?   What would I have been doing? Probably solitaire. Something to occupy my time. I usually snooze or -- you know? Weve made that trip many times so Ive seen the scenery.   Right.   For the first three-and-a-half hours of the drive everything is totally normal. Grover calmly at the wheel Barbara on her laptop. And then Barbara looks up from her computer.   And I notice my husband is speeding. And I said What are you doing? And he said I cant slow down. And I said Well you have to slow down. And he said Well Im applying the brake it is not slowing down.   When -- how -- do you guys remember exactly how fast you were going?   Hes a much better judge of that than I would be. Let me ask him. G.H? When our car ran away with us how fast would you say the car was going?   Probably 65.   Im sure it was more than that. Probably -- hes saying 65. Im saying 65 70.   Okay.   How are both of you feeling? I can imagine feeling like really panicked.   Mr. Walten doesnt panic. Mrs. Walten panics.   Right!   I am freaking out.   At this point in the drive theyre on a two-lane highway cutting through a huge wetland area. So on both sides its just swamp and water.   And I didnt want to go down in the swamp.   Thats Grover Walten Barbaras husband. The driver.   Every time I would attempt to brake as quick as I took my foot off the brake it would start accelerating again. I finally just basically stood on the brake.   They way they described it it was almost like one of those Hollywood movies where youre like careening down the highway.   We are not slowing down.   Zipping by cars.   Seatbelts on.   Weaving in and out of traffic.   Computer's down praying that this was gonna turn out all right.   For somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes Grover fought with the car.   I cant remember if it -- how did you stop it? I know we crossed that swampy bridge.   I wore the brake pads and the rotor out.   Okay so thats what stopped it. By just applying the brakes so long and so hard it wore the brakes and the rotor out. And thats how the car finally came to a stop.   They called their son who did some quick research online.   And apparently there were already complaints.       Turns out all over the country ...     People were losing control ...           ... of their Toyotas.     I remember this. This was a big thing. This was a big news story yeah.   From the driver point of view what was happening was that the car would take off. Sometimes at low speeds but sometimes at high speed. And the drivers would say My foot was on the brake pedal but my car kept going faster.   This is Phil Koopman hes a professor at Carnegie Mellon University. And co-founder of Edge Case Research.   And my specialty for all these years has been fault-tolerant computing.   And Phil told us that around the same time these accidents started happening ...   In the early-2000s ...   Was the same time that Toyota cars -- and all cars really -- were starting to become computerized.   Thats right.   Before this moment cars were mostly mechanical and you could like you know pop the hood and basically figure out what was going on. But after this moment? Its mostly computers. And not just in the engine.   Your car has dozens or in some cases more than a hundred little boxes that have electronics inside it.   How small?   Oh sort of like small book-sized. Like a paperback book.   Embedded within the wall and floor and ceiling of the car?   Wherever they can find room.   They do all sorts of little things.   When you take out your keys and you press the button and your doors unlock theres a computer inside that key sending a message to a computer inside the car telling the computer at the lock to open the locks.   Three computers are conversing about that unlocking moment?   At least three.   And they are responsible for some pretty important things. Like now when you press the gas pedal instead of it being this direct physical link to the throttle which makes the car go that pedal is now ...   Basically just an input to a computer.   Why do they want to do that?   Well you can get better fuel economy. You know its a more pleasant drive. So that part is great. Its a better driver experience. But you just trusted your life to software and thats a new thing.   Was that talked about or known? Or was this sort of a silent transition that happened that you as the driver would never really know unless you looked it up in Popular Mechanics or something?   I dont think that you would probably have known as a regular driver.   And so ...   When this whole thing broke ...   Because most people did not know that their cars were now computers and because most of the victims ...   Oh gosh ...   Were on the older side.   We might be older but were not stupid people.   They were basically blaming the driver for all of these.   Barbara says when they took the car to the Toyota dealership ...   Ill never forget the smirky grin he had on his face telling us he didnt find anything wrong with the car.   If youre on the car company side you say So you pressed the pedal and it kept going faster. Which pedal does that?    I told them Id been driving since I was 15 and I knew the difference in the accelerator and a brake.   And so these random accelerations ...   Sort of flew under the radar.   Until ...     August 28 2009.       A 911 call came from a passenger of a Lexus Toyota.                             Not one of the four people in that car survived.   Its a 45-year-old male California highway patrol officer Mark Saylor whose specialty is vehicle inspector. And this guy cant stop his car.   And this just broke that driver error narrative ...     To pieces.   And so thats what launched all the inquiries and the recalls.     Toyota settled a huge 1.6-billion lawsuit.     Without admitting any blame.   But after that ...       With the death count rising to 89 people a queue of 500 death and injury cases started to form. And when the experts Phil being one of them were given full access to Toyotas software and hardware they found a number of things wrong. But the key in all of this was you guessed it.   If you had a bit flip the task that controls the throttle position could die.   Causing it to stick in some open position.   That would happen. They reproduced that on a car.   Well and in the first of those death and injury cases what -- what happened?   The jury said that they -- well I have to make sure I only say things that Im allowed to say. This is actually a big deal.   Oh okay.   Yeah so they -- Toyota went after one of the experts for contempt. So you have to be careful.   Wow. Okay.   Sorry. Im gonna have to look it up.   No no. Take your time.   So the jury found that Toyota was liable for the death. And the only theory presented in the case was that the computer killed people. And the jury agreed.   Toyota settled that case immediately and began to settle all 500 other cases in the queue.   Rip the Band-Aid off here pay everybody. Lets not drag this thing out and put it through the public.   I cant speculate as to their motives but I think the facts speak for themselves.   God I mean this is ...   Yeah. And like one quick crazy note. This ruling actually led to the freedom of a Minnesota man named Koua Fong Lee who had already spent two-and-a-half years in prison charged with vehicular homicide for killing three people in the Toyota he was driving when it suddenly accelerated out of control.   Whoa!   So this ruling like got this guy out of prison. But he was in prison for two-and-a-half years before this you know -- this acceleration thing.   That is nuts!   I know.   Wow!   Like in your opinion and your experience do you think this specific case and other cases were in fact caused by just this crazy cosmic chain of events that led to a tiny little bit of electricity grazing a circuit board?   As amazing as it sounds these type of events are almost certainly caused by that. Now was that primary contribution to the Toyota UA? I dont know and probably no one will ever know.   I feel like the way youre painting the world almost just looks like theres just smoking wrecks everywhere. Like crashed planes and cars into light poles and the internets not working and I -- how are we -- how are we functioning? I dont even understand.   So as soon as we found out this is the problem we went back and we started fixing the problems. Once we know that autopilot is the one thats causing the problem then we fixed it.   How did you fix it?   So you get three copies of everything. The same electronic system. There are three of them and at least two of them have to agree to do anything.   Oh smart.   So today like tripling and doubling redundancy is the norm in planes and cars and like any other life-saving technology.   And actually the same thing is being done in Schaerbeek after that incident in 2003. So now when they have an election each vote is actually counted twice by the computer. And if one of those tallies doesnt match the other they know something's gone wrong immediately.   So thats cool. But heres the thing. This doubling and tripling is just too expensive to do with most things. And as our electronics get smaller and smaller ...   And smaller and smaller and smaller.   These bit flips are just gonna happen more and more.   Why would that be?   Well the smaller the transistor the less energy you need to flip that bit.   Now we are at the point where you only need about a thousand electrons to represent a one or a zero.   Wait how many electrons did you need back in the '70s?   Oh probably a million.   Oh and now you need a thousand. Wow okay.   And transistors made today are like tiny tiny.   Your hair is 50 microns in diameter. So take your hair and slice it a thousand times. So that gets you down to 50 nanometers. And we are looking at seven nanometers. So you also have to pretty much slice it down seven more times and what you are left with is the size of transistors that are coming in the market in the next two years.   Will they be in cellphones and laptops and things like that?   They will be everywhere.   So as we get better and better and better at miniaturizing our technology we are more and more and more at risk to these tiny flying projectiles.   Right. Through our technological advancement we have invited this problem upon ourselves.   That is one way to look at it yes. If you go back to those big cell phones which are weighing you know five kg each and about a foot long then you wouldnt have this problem.         Im somewhat open-minded but at this point in time I you know I question that. But its not that big a deal. Okay. Well its -- its home and white wine time.   Well we could not agree more.      And so what we have decided to do is provide you with a small entertainment for you to sip your white wine with.   Simon has made a video to accompany this episode that must be experienced.   Yes!   It is at Radiolab.org. Watch it.   Very short and very uh weird.   Yeah. This piece was produced and reported by Simon Adler and Annie McEwen.

Yeah I think so. I think I am gonna go now.   Well it is not going forever. Just for the moment.   Yeah just for the -- I feel reluctant to leave the room.   I felt that in your voice.   Yes I know.   I am Jad Abumrad.   And I am just gonna stay here forever.   Okay. Well you are -- yeah he is Robert. And we will see you in the next one. . This is so much fun so much fun!
