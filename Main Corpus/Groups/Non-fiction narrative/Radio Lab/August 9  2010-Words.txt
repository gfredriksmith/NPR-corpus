Introduction Youre listening to Radiolab from WNYC and NPR.   Okay let us begin   Hello hello.   With an unusual encounter which comes from this lady here.   Im Susan Schaller and where do you want me to start?   Her story starts actually it starts kind of abruptly.   I was indeed riding a bicycle to high school.  And a catering truck hit me and I was put in the hospital with a concussion. I was seventeen years old. And the concussion is bad enough that it slowed my brain enough that I could not read. And so naturally I could not go to school.   Which sucked for her.   At seventeen I was very much a nerd and I was bored out of my mind.   So imagine Susan sitting there in the hospital.  One day one of her friends   A friend of mine who was just a little older and had graduated the semester before me suggested going to the nearby university and crashing classes   Now wait a second why would you goif your brain was working slowly why wouldnt you go swimming?   Well I couldnt read but I could listen and I could hear and the person was saying oh its a lot better than high school.   So one day she was at this college.   Just kind of wandering down a random hallway.   And I opened the first door on the left. That was the accident that changed my whole life just picking that door.   At the front of the room there was this older guy. He was thin he was bald and he was tracing shapes in the air with his hands.   It was as if there were pictures being painted in the air and then they immediately disappeared.  Then another picture appeared. I was mesmerized.   Wow.   The professor was signing.  This class was actually one of the first classes to teach sign at a regular hearing university ever.   I had also walked into history but did not know it.   Fast forward five years Susan now is fluent in sign.  She moves to Los Angeles.  It is the late 1970s.   And I was snatched and put into interpreter training programs because at that time they were very very few interpreters.  And I found myself in a classroom.   In a community college.   In something called a reading skills class.   So she walks into the class.  She sees kids all over the classroom making big excited gestures one to the other.   And at the door I saw this man holding himself.   Kind of off by himself.   Making his own straitjacket.   She went over to the instructor and she pointed at the guy and she said Who who is that guy over there. And the instructor said Well he was born deaf.  His uncle he has this kind of insistent uncle who who brings him here every day.  We we do not know exactly what to do with him though.   What did this guy look like?   He was a beautiful um well now I know I do not know if I would have had that in my head at the time beautiful looking Mayan.  You know high cheekbones and black hair black eyes.   And something about his eyes caught her attention.   He was studying mouths and I walked up to him and said Hello my name is Susan.   And this is where things start to get a little weird. He looks at her. And instead of signing his name whatever it was.   He brings up his hands   Signs right back to her   Hello my name is Susan.   Susan like shakes her head and says No no I am Susan.   And he responds No no I am Susan.   Everything you said he tried to say.   Exactly. I call it a visual echolalia.  And I remember thinking   Why is he doing this?   I mean Susan did he did he look like he had some kind of disability or condition.   He was uh he was intelligent.  I would not have been able to answer if you asked me how can you see intelligence?  But you can actually see intelligence in people's eyes   He was just missing something.   To copy me meant that he did not really know what I was doing.   And that is when it occurred to her   This man doesnt have language.   Wait how old was this guy?   He was 27 years old.   And in all that time no one had taught him sign language or anything?   Well he didnt know he was deaf.  He was born deaf.  He did not know there was sound.   Really?   27 years no idea that there was sound.  He could see the mouth moving.  He could see people responding.  He thought we figured all this stuff out visually.  And he thought I must be stupid.   And so here's the question for our hour. This is Radiolab.  Im Jad Abumrad.   Im Robert Krulwich.   Words.  What do words do for us?   Are they necessary?   Can you live without em?   Can you think without them?   Can you dream without them? Can you   Thats enough.   Can you swim without them?   No no thats enough.   Alright back to the story.  So this man that Susan met we do not actually know his real name but when she wrote about him in her book A Man without Words she called him Ildefonso.   There they are sitting in the classroom.  She is right there with him.   Of course she is wondering   What have you have been doing for 27 years?!    So she thinks well let me see if I can teach him some just basic sign language.  In an interesting case she takes out a book and makes the sign book.   But the sign for book looks like opening up a book.  So he thought I was ordering him to open a book.   So he grabs the book and he opens it.   Cuz he thought I was asking him to do something.  It was very difficult.  If I gave him the sign for standing up he thought I wanted him to stand up.  And so I could not I could not have a conversation with him. And it was the most frustrating thing I have ever done in my life.   Wait a second how long did this go on for?   Well uh weeks it was weeks.   Wow.   Often times when we said goodbye or just left  I really believed that we would not see each other again and I was often times very surprised when he would be sitting there at the table.  And I think sometimes he looked surprised that I showed up.   But after a couple of weeks of him   Constantly miming copying me.   She had an idea.   Perhaps it is just possible that if I if I died tomorrow I would have had only one really really good thought in my life.  And this was it I am going to ignore him.     I taught an invisible student.  I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact. And I set up an empty chair   And then she says she would hold up to this empty chair a picture of a cat.   and I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature a catso I would be miming a cat and petting a catand then Id sign the sign for cat.   Then she would hop to the other seat the invisible students seat and pretend to get it.   Oh I know you know with my facial expression Oh I get it!   So you are playing all the parts.  You are both the teacher and the invisible student.   Thats right thats right.   Wow.   Doing all these crazy things and hed just watch me.   He stopped copying her which was good   But. Id do this over and over and over for days and days and days   And she says he just did not get it.   He looked bored a lot of times.   But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises   Something happened.   Out of the corner of her eye she sees him shift his body.   And he lookedIt is interesting how his body was upright and he looked like something was about to happen.    He looked around the roomthis is a 27 year old man and he looks around the room as if he had just landed from Mars and it was the first time he had ever saw anything. Something was about to happen.   His eyes grew wider she says and then wider.  And then   He slaps his hands on the table.  Oh! Everything has a name!     And he looks at me in this demanding way and I sign table.  And he points to the door and I sign door. And he points to the clock and he points to me and I sign Susan. And then he started crying.  He just collapsed and he started crying.     What is it that happens in human beings when we get symbols and we start trading symbols? It changes our thinking.  It changes our ideas ofit is no longer the thing a table that we eat on but there is something about symbol table that makes the table look different. Ildefonso was in love. He was in love.  He was like everything has a name. And for the first couple weeks he had this list of names that kept growing and growing.  Kid Paper.  Kid Eagle.  Kid Clock.  Kid Green.   I kept copying words for him.  Kid Cat.  Kid Alligator.  Kid Cat.  Kid Cardinal.   Gave him the sign for door.  Kid Door.  Kid Door.   Then I would-  Kid Door.   Write d-o-o-r.  Kid Serpent.  Kid Cheetah.   And he  Kid Strawberries.   Folded this paper.  Kid Paper.   As if it was  Kid Treasure!   Treasure and he would pull it out everyday and he would  Kid Lion   Carefully unfold it.  Kid Tiger.   And he would add to it.  Kid Orange juice.    Kid Apple.  Kid Blue Jay.  Kid Thinking.  Kid Believe.  Kid Horse.  Kid Leaf.  Kid Idea.   Add to it.  Kid Lamb.  Kid Lou.   Kid Table.  Kid Bird.  Kid Wall.  Kid Dove.  Kid Name.   Add to it.  Kid Pig.  Kid Left.  Kid From.  Kid Right.  Kid Cows.  Kid Hawk  Kid Left of the blue wall.  Kid Octopus.  Kid Symbol.  Kid Treasure.  Kid Words.  Kid Eggs.  Kid Ham.  Kid Hippopotamus.   What is it that happens in human beings when we get symbols?  Kid Symbols.   And that you know once you have begun to put words onto things you can look at a thing say this symbolic sound table and the person opposite you knows what you are talking about.   But she seems to be saying something deeper though when you get the word for table than suddenly the table like this table right here  looks different.  Like its somehow the word changes the world in some fundamental way.  Now I dont know if thats true about the table thing but consider what happens when you put words together okay when you link them up.   Good okay.   So I want to tell you about this experiment.   Fantastic.   That I learned about from a fellow I talk to sometimes.  Charles   Im Charles Fernyhough.  Im a psychologist at Durham University in the UK.   Fernyhough.   And uh when I first read about this experiment in Charles book   Called A Thousand Days of Wonder.   It blew my mind out of my nose and on to the pages of the book.     It was a little messy.   I never want to be with you in a library.   It takes a little journey to get to the mind blowing part but luckily well Ill let Charles explain it.  The whole thing happens in a room.   Yeah youre put into this room which is colored completely white.  The walls are white.  The ceilings white.  The floors white.   So its all white.   All white.   Everythings white.  And you can tell where you are to the extent that some of the walls are longer than others. So on your left hand side   Are we in a rectangle is what youre describing?   Yeah its a rectangular room.   Are you with me so far?   Im with you so far.   Okay so just to give you some of the baseline conditions here Imagine you are a rat in this room.  Okay?   And somebody comes along and hides an object in one corner of the room.   What?   It can be anything.  I mean for rats you would food.   Like a biscuit or something?   Yeah.   You hide a biscuit in one of the four corners.  You see it but before you can get to it they pick you up by your tail spin you around a bunch of times   So you dont know where you are you dont know which direction you are facing in.  And then they right now go find the biscuit.   So if you do this with a rat what will happen is it will say alright let me go find the biscuit and it will     Go to one corner which looks right.  But of course the room also looks like that if you turn around through 180 degrees and face exactly the opposite direction.   Because its a rectangle.   So they get it right 50 of the time.   Because corners of rectangles two of them are identical.   Yeah.   Alright so uh  should we get on with this because Im well aware of rectangles.   I just needed to get that out of the way because the cool part is coming up now.   I hope so.   What the experimenters did next is they took one of the four white walls and they turned it blue.     So imagine this scenario your in this room youve got these four white walls or rather three white walls.   One of them is blue.   Right.  Well now youre not confused anymore.  You can relate everything to the blue wall.  You can be like the corner with the biscuit was left of the blue wall or right of the blue wall.   I like it to the left.   You now have a blue wall as a   Navigational clue.   Yes!   That makes sense you know we would all be able to do that thats not going to be difficult for us.   Alright have we got to the good part yet?   Turns out though   The rats he says   Theyre still scoring fiftyfifty.   What?   Its as if they cant take any notice of the blue wall.   Even with the blue wall they can only find the biscuit 50 of the time!   Wait a second can rats see color?   Yeah rats can do color.   They do color pretty well.   Okay.   They also do left right just fine.   But what they cant do is connect those two bits of information together.   In other words they can only well they can do left that they can do.  They can do blue but theyre both separate.  They cant do left of blue.   These different kinds of knowledge cant talk to each other.   How does anyone know that? I mean what rats have been interviewed for this?   What? They infer this based on studying the rats.   So the rat doesnt have what? Doesnt have the neurons doesnt have thewhat doesnt he have?   The rat cant do it thats all they need to know.  And Im going to make it weirder nowneither can some humans.   I spent the first ten or fifteen years of my scientific life studying creatures who dont talk yet.   Thats Elizabeth Spelke shes a psychologist at Harvard.  Quite famous for her work with um    Kid Kai   As you can hear   Babies and I was interested in their abilities in relation to other animals  Lab Assistant Come on get up were going to go the monkey room.   So she began the baby development lab which is filled with toys and on any given day five or six really tiny kids  Interviewer How old is she?  Lab Person  Shes six months.  Interviewer And whos this?  Kid Im a big kid.   Toddlers too.  Interviewer How old are you?  Kid Three and a half.  Interviewer Three and a half big time.   So at a certain point Elizabeth Spelke decided to build a version of the white room in this lab cuz she wondered if rats have so much trouble connecting the idea of left to blue what about uh   Surely   Baby humans.   A self-respecting eighteen month old human child would succeed in putting them together but Kid No.   What we find is that children behave just like the rats.   Just like the rats   Just like the rats   Really   Just like the rats or almost just like the rats?   Well we dont test them with food we dont test them with digging  so in superficial ways superficial features of the studies are different.   But she says kids like the rats cannot connect the idea of left to the idea of blue they just cant do it.  And they cant do it at  Kid One.   They cant do it at  Kid Two   They cant do it at three.  Kid Four five.   And we find that those children start performing like adults around six years of age.   Now Im interested.   Good   Something happens at the ripe old age of six.  It is shockingly late right?   Yeah.   Well something happens at the age of six that suddenly allows the kid to connect concepts like left to concepts like blue.  And the question is what? What happens?   Several people have suggested that one candidate for a process thats doing this is language.   What do you mean its language? Kids are talking certainly at three four five and six.  Theyre talking like like uh you know too much!   But theyre not what they havent yet started to use is spatial language and particularly the kinds of spatial language that adults would use in this situation to describe what theyre doing.   And somewhere around the age of six they start to use phrases like  Kid Left of the blue wall.   And those arent just words that come out of the childs mouth.  Liz thinks that inside the childs brain what that phrase does   is link these concepts together   Clink! And in that moment  Kid Left of the blue wall!   The child leaves the rats behind.   I cantare youshe doesnt think that kids have that   Well let me put it to you a different way.  This is my best understanding of what she thinks.  Her basic idea is that a childs brain begins as a series of islands.     And on one island way over here youve got say color. We can call that the blue   island.  J   Blue blue blue   Thats the part of you that perceives the color blue.  Way on the other side of the brain youve got the part of you that perceives spatial stuff like left.  J   Left left left   Maybe a third objects like wall.  J   Wall wall wall These things are there from the beginning but there separate.  Then you get the words left blue wall and then the child for the first time comes upon the phrase  J   Left of the blue wall.   And in that moment all the islands  Kid Kaboom!   Come together.  It is literally the phrase itself she says that creates that internal connection.   Everybody has always talked about how language is this incredible tool for communication that allows us to exchange information with other people so much more richly and affectively than other animals can.  But language also seems to me to serve as a mechanism of communication between different systems within a single mind.   There you go.   Wouldnt it be just as possible just listen to me here that the kids brain is developing some new connections and what follows then follows from the changes in the brain.   So the words are like an after.   Yeah.  After.   After fact?  After effect.   Well thats uh no no.  The experimenters actually accounted for that.   What the experiments did next is that they thought okay if language is adding this extra element lets knock it out.   How would you do that? Would you like shoot something into their brain that kills the language part or something?   Um theres a much simpler way of doing it and a much more humane  thing you can do.   What we did is put adults in the room.   And then she says she gave them an IPod.   Theyve got headphones.   Playing through those headphones is someone talking.   Yep   And their job while theyre in the room is to repeat what the person is saying.   Continuously listening to speech and repeating it the whole time they were in there.   Its actually a really hard thing to do if youve ever tried shadowing while someone is speaking.  I mean if you tried   Can we try it? You go and Ill shadow you.   Okay Jad  Okay Jad  Im going to  Im going to  try and start speaking now  Start speaking now  and I want you to say it and I want you to say it right back to me exactly as a I say it exactly as I say it and without any   Oh my god thats starting to hurt my head.  Thats really hard actually.   Yeah it is hard.  And what that does is it knocks out your capacity to use language for yourself   Basically battering the words out of the adults head.   Why are they doing this again?   Well they wanted to see like if you blasted the words out of somebodys head   What would happen?   Can they find the biscuit? Will they be able to form that simple thought left of the blue wall or would they be like the rats who cant.  And-     And we actually got really dramatic results.   They went right back to being like the rats.   Wow.   Yeah.   But Charles what Im wondering is that if language allows you to construct a though that is so basic as The biscuit is left of the blue wall what is thought without language?   Well I dont think its very much at all.   What do you mean?   Im going to put it a different way and this involves making quite a controversial statement.  I dont think very young children do think.   Like think period.   Was there a period at the end of that sentence?   I dont think they think in the way I want to call thinking which is a bit of cheat but let me say what I mean by thinking.   Okay.   If you reflect on your own experience if you think about whats going on inside your head as youre just walking to work or sitting on a subway train. Much of whats going on in your head at that point is actually verbal.  I want to suggest that the central thread of all that is actually language its a stream of inner speech.  Thats what most of us think of as thinking.   Well on the other hand what Im most aware of when Im reflecting is the stuff that I cant put into words.  I think that hes exaggerating the role of language here.  Yes     This all really hinges on how you would define thinking and Liz would say take a musician like Ill give you my example Bill EvanSusan Schaller Here is a form of thought that carries you through a definite sequence of phrases feelings emotions changes. And there are no words!   But theres something that we get access to when we gain a full natural language that we can use not only to communicate with other people but with ourselves.   Test. Testing. Test. Test. Test. Test.   Language is fundamentally a combinatorial system.   As we head up the steps.  What is this?   Were going to Columbia.   Columbia  University.   University.  See wed gotten interested in the last thing that Liz Spelke said that language being a combinatorial thing.   System.   Right.  And that lead us to Columbia.   Heres the deal   Were seven minutes late.   You have words now.  You have words in combination now.  Now you can play with the combinations.   And thatas youll hear   Its just us three then right?   Its just us three.   Good.   Opens up a kind of infinity.   Head to foot Now is he total gules horridly trick'd With blood of fathers mothers daughters sons Baked and impasted with the parching streets That lend a tyrannous and damned light To their lord's murdeRobert Krulwich This is Shakespeare.  When I sat in middle school and they gave us Shakespeare. roasted in wrath and fire And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore I was completely confused and I felt stupid.   Can you just introduce yourself?   This is   James Shapiro.   He is a Shakespeare scholar obviously.   At Columbia  University where Ive taught for uh 25 years.   And one reason why he says that Shakespeare can be confusing is often Shakespeare behaved not so much as a write but more like uh   Like a chemist combining elements.     Hes taking words and hes shoving them together smashing them together if you will.   And   Combining   Sometimes these experiments didnt go so well.   The princes orgulous.  Orgulous has not stuck.   No.     What does it mean?   You got me I mean I should know I taught   But look what he did just by adding a little prefix un.   Theres so many words that were now familiar withunnerved.  You know we all know what that means but nobody had heard of unnerved unaware uncomfortable.   He made up uncomfortable?   He was the first to use that word     On a stage.   Right.  Unearthly unhand undress uneducated ungoverned unmitigated unwillingness unpublished something thats near and dear to my heart.   Unpublished.   Unsolicited unswayed unclogged unappeased unchanging unreal.   He made up unreal?   He was the first to use it in print or on stage.   Would an audience at the time have understood what the un prefix meant not real?   I think it takes you a split second. Uuuunnnnnrrrrrreeeeaaaaallll To kind of put that un on the real.   But then suddenly you got this new concept that there is something real but not.   Hes taking words that ordinarily are not stuck together things like mad cap ladybird.  Shoving them together eye drops to achieve a kind of atomic power.  Eyesore eyeball.   He did eyeball?   Yes.   Its hard to understand how someone could think of that up it seems like its always been there.   If you ask me what his greatest gift is. He is putting them together into phrases that have stuck in our heads. So truth will out.   Truth will out.   What is done is done. I could go on and on.   Go on and on!   He wants you too go on and on.   Crack of doom. My favorite Dead as a doornail. A dish fit for the gods.  A dog will have his day. Fainthearted fool's paradise forever and a day foregone conclusion the game is afoot the game is up. Greek to meet Im in a pickle in my heart of hearts in my minds eye kill with kindness.  Believe it or not knock knock who is there?  J   Oh!    Laugh yourself into stitches love is blind what the Dickens alls well that ends well.  Something wicked this way comes.  And a sorry sight.  J   Wow.   Thats a champion.   Thats pretty fantastic.   How did he create phrases that stick in the mind? That make it seems as if they always existed.   Yeah how?  Youre taking out a book.   Im thinking of a passage here.   That is maybe the biggest book I have ever seen.     Nonsense.   It was at everything least 3000 pages.   Shakespeare doesnt write a lot about process. But there are one or two places that he does in a poem called Lucrece. In which a woman is raped Lucreces Rape.  And she has to write a letter to her husband explaining what happened to her. And she is struggling to find words in which to do this and finally she picks up the pen and it goElizabeth Spelke She prepares to write. First hovering oer the paper with her quill Conceit and grief and eager combat fight What wit sets down is blotted straight with will This is too curious good this blunt and ill.  Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions which shall go before.  Ill read that couplet again Much like a press of people at a door Throng her inventions which shall go before.  If you want to extrapolate from this something that Shakespeare might have himself experienced you have a situation which all these ideas are pressing.  Its like a throng of them.  Whos getting through that doorway first?     It is a little bit maybe like that experience you might have at a nightmare New York club. Were youve got like thousands of people in a tiny space and everyones trying to push their way out and theyre like God let me through the door.  Get out of my way! Its just like this   Throng of images sounds conceits thoughts ideas.  And they are providing the pressure that is needed to produce words.     You know what?   What?   This makes sense to me this interpretation. And not just for Shakespeare for anybody.  Certainly the guy we met at the beginning Ildefonso.   Who just learned words for the first time.   Yeah. I mean as you move through the world if you are sensitive at all and your observant you are gonna get filled up with all of these things which you have to express but cannot until you get those words. Thenboom! The door opens.    And thanks to James Shapiro professor at Columbia University whose newest book iSusan Schaller Contested Will Who wrote Shakespeare?  Also thanks to our kids Louisa Krasner Stella Astory and Isaiah Harrison and also thanks to the moms that brought them in Terrace Tripoli Kerry Donahue and Patricia Starreck.     Hello. This is Susan Schaller.  Radiolab is funded in part by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation.   Charles Fernyhough.  Radiolab is produced by WNYC and distributed by NPR.       Hey! Im Jad Abumrad   Im Robert Krulwich   This is Radiolab. This hour     Words.   Power of words   So once words enter your head once they tickle in there and weve just explained how that happens.   Sort of.   Then theyhow do you know theyre always there?   What if they are not? What would happen if that throng that is in your head    What if all of that stuff that is in your head. Suddenly went poof! Got yanked right out of your head.   Hmmmmm   What would be left?   Well this got us thinking about a very famous talk at one of the Ted conferences.   I grew up to study the brain because   A talk given by a neuroanatomist named Jill Bolte.  Is it Bolte or Bolt?   Bolte.   Bolte Taylor.  And all you really need to know is that one morning in December of 1996 Doctor Taylor woke up and she had she had a headache.   I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye. And it was the kind of pain caustic pain that you get when you bite into ice cream. And it just gripped me and then it released me. And it was very unusual for me to experience any kind of of pain so I thought okay I will just start my normal routine. So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio-glider which is a full body full exercise machine. And I am jamming away on this thing and I am realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar. And I thought Whoa Im a weird looking thing! So I get off the machine. And Im standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower and then I lost my balance I am propped up against the the wall. And I am asking myself what is wrong with me? What is going on? And at that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side.   In fact a blood vessel in the left hemisphere of Jills brain had popped.  And that part of her brain was starting to shut down.   And it was the shut down that really caught our attention.     In that moment my brain chatter went totally silent. Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button. So here I am in this space and my job and any stress related to my to my job it was gone and I felt lighter in my body.  And then all of a sudden left hemisphere comes back online and it says to me Hey! Were having a stroke we gotta get some help!  And Im going Aaah! I got a problem! I got a problem! So its like okay I got a problem but then I immediately drifted right back out.   And I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land. So Im just watching my brain become more and more incapable of functioning.   That is Jill Bolte Taylor herself.   Hi Robert   We actually got her into a studio.   Hello Jad.   Hello. Because we wanted to ask some questions about that moment when her inner voices went away.   So lets talk about brain chatter for a moment.  In the story that weve told so far your still asking yourself questions.   Yeah.   Now did that stop?   It it on the morning of the stroke. I was doing this wafting dance between the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere.  So language would come back on. But once I got to the emergency room and I passed out when I woke later that afternoon. I had absolutely no language.   Did you know your name?  No.  did you know your address?   No   Did you know about your summer from 1983.   No.   You know like my mom is sitting   I didnt know any of that.   None of it?   I didnt know any of it.   Just imagine she is lying in her bed.  Her head is shaved. Wrapped in bandages she is had hours of brain surgery shes got tubes coming out of her mouth her nose.  She is lost her career she is lost her language   And I lost all my memories   And yet she says sitting there and that is suddenly wordless space   I had found a peace inside of myself that I had not known before. I had pure silence inside of my mind.  Pure silence.   Pure silence   Pure Silence  What was   You know not that little voice that you know you wake up in the morning and the first thing your brain says it Oh man the sun is shining. Well imagining you do not hear that little voice that says man the sun is shining you just experience the sun and the shining.   Is this the absence of reflection of any kind? Is it just sensual intake and period?   That is exactly what it was it was.  It was all of the present moment.   Did you have thoughts?   I had joy.     I just had joy. I had I had this magnificent experience of Im this collection of these beautiful cells. I am organic. Im this this organic entity.   Did you have a dead head period by any chance?   You know why I missed that by a few years but I get that a lot.   And and the other thing that she told us is that lying in that bed without words she says she felt connected to things to everything in a way that she never had before.   Oh yeah I lost all definition of myself in relationship to everything in the external world.   You mean like he could not figure out where you ended.   How much of that was about language.  A little part? A lot? I mean.   Oh I would say it was huge.  Language is an ongoing information processing it is that constant reminder. I am this is my name this is all the data related to me these are my likes and my  dislikes these are my beliefs I am an individual I am a single I am a solid I am separate from you.  This is my name   Now as fruity as this may all sound to pin all this on language we have run into this idea before.  A couple seasons ago. Paul Brucks remember him?   Yeah sure.   Neuropsychologist.   Well if you have to ask me about myself  He told me that there is a theory out there which he believes actually that all a person is in the end.  Like all the personhood of a person the I or the you of a person all that is in the end is a   Story.   A story you tell yourself.   What we normally think of when we think about ourselves. Is really a story it is the story of what is happened to that body over time.   I did not have that portion of my language center that tells a story curious little Jill me Jill Bolte Taylor climbing the Harvard ladder through language loves dissection cutting up things that language was gone. I got to essentially become an infant  again.   I mean this is the problem here.   What do you mean?   When you drop out of the I ness of yourself or the story of yourself then you are left she says at peace I could argue that that is just stranded that is stranded in the sunshine with the wind in in the now.   But I mean its not like she stayed there   Well thats true.   I mean we wouldnt be talking to her if she had an as she started to recover she ran into something kinda interesting -- Which sounded to me  sort of like what maybe the rats and the babies go through in the white room. She would have these disparate thoughts and then stall out like she couldnt bring them together.   Yeah. When when people would speak to me I would I remembered in pictures.  So if somebody would ask me who is the president of the of the United States of America this is a huge question. So for the next several hours I would be pondering president. President. President Whats a president? President. And then I would get a picture in my mind of a president as a leader.   Was it a picture of a specific guy?   It is it was actually it is still flashes into my mind. It is it is a picture of a silhouette of a male.   A presidential profile.   Like maybe the idea of the president basically.   Yeah   So that was her president .   And then I had to figure out a United   States. And so eventually come up with this map in my mind a picture of the United States.   Like a line drawing.  So now shes got this map.  Shes got this silhouette of a guy. And she said after hours   President United States president United States and it was like oh my god.   She still could not somehow bring them together.   Yeah!   I did not have the road that I had to travel in order to come up. I think it was Clinton at the time. Yeah it was Clinton at the time.   Now as Jill starts to get better-   This after eight years of hard work and recovery   Finally the words start to trickle back.   And when they did she says that silence that she loved so much got pushed out.   That was on of the sacrifices. For me that was a sacrifice.   Well.   Well.    Were doing a language show here and youre the anti-queen of our language show! Youre like saying who needs it.   No no no no no.  But what I am saying is that in order for us to communicate with language we pull ourselves away from a different kind of experience.  I do believe that there are times when you need to let your brain chatter be quiet.   But is it fair to say that this isplease agree or disagree with this statement I think that words and language and grammar are necessary but not half as good as wind in my hair as smell in my nose and that old right brain sensual immediacy.     Yeah you know if uh if I had to choose which is essentially what you are saying if I had to chooseUmthat would be really really really tough decision.

The power of words of language.  Okay Nicaragua 1970s. That is where our next story starts. Are you with me?   Ahah.   So imagine youre a kid thats deaf in Nicaragua at this time   Born deaf?   Born deaf.   Born deaf okay.   Youve always been deaf and youre the only one in your family thats deaf.  So youre in this situation where everybody's talking there mouths are moving you cannot hear it. And you do not know sign language cuz no ones taught you.   There was no deaf school in Nicaragua then?   Nothing.   Okay.   No deaf education of any kind.  So if you were this kid all you have really got our a couple of gestures really crude gestures you have worked out to talk to your family and friends but beyond that your cut off.     Like Ildefonso the guy we met at the beginning of the show except in Nicaragua in the seventies there were hundreds maybe thousands of these Ildefonsos.   Really?   Yeah. But then everything changes.    In the late seventies Hope Simosa who was the wife of the then dictator established a new school for special education.  I think she had someone in her family who had a disability not deafness.   But the school would include deaf people and that says psychology professor Ann Senghas was a first because now instead of deaf kids scattered about they were together in the same room.    There were fifty deaf kids in that first entering class   Preschool to sixth grade.    In the late seventies.   And for most of them this was the first time they ever met another deaf person    Before the world was going on around them and everyone was all talking and they were cut off from that. And suddenly for the first time they were all there and they were what was happening and they were what there was to talk about.   But they didnt have a way of talking.  These were fifty different kids whod never learned a language and had fifty different sets of like rudimentary gestures that they used.   Whoa that must have been   Yeah like fifty people with fifty different ways to try and   Ask for breakfast.   Or say they want to go outside. I mean nothing was shared.    It is not like the teachers were using signs in the classroom.  Everything in the class was Spanish.   Which none of them knew.    Copying into their notebooks a lot of it was going right over their heads   So at the beginning things were completely confusing.    But they are riding on the bus for an hour everyday and their playing out at recess for an hour every day and there getting together at the park   And no one knows how it happened. Like maybe one of the kids-   Who is very charismatic.   He invented a sign for say ball.  He told it to another kid who was very you know socially active and that second kid then spread the sign.  However it worked over time the signs of these fifty kids used    Started to converge into common system.   And when you step back from all what that means    They created a language.      They did not just take it from somewhere else they could not just take it from somewhere else. They created their own.   But how unusual is that?    This has happened with languages all over the world but not while people were watching.   So what youre saying is this is the first time we have been able to watch a language being born.    Yeah.   Wow.  And for the last twenty years that is what Ann has been doing. Shes been going to Nicaragua to that school and watching.      So uh oh you wanted to  describe the I may have gotten recording of this but when you arrive at the school the busses come around.   The kids are all screaming and leaning out the windows and signing to each other and the kids pile out and they line up in rows on the basketball court thats in the center of the schoolyard. And they all sing the national hymn.  And the deaf kids all sign the national hymn.  And they all have one hand over their heart and sign with the other hand while the hearing kids sing it.   Ann visited the school for the first time in 1990 about 10 years after it was formed. She would been working at the time with a linguist    Named Judy Kegel.   Studying basic linguist type stuff    Trying to figure how the verbs work and whether they have agreement with their grammatical objects.   And along the way her and a collaborator Jennie Pyers stumbled onto something really surprising about the power of certain words. So to set it up When she got there the first time in to Nicaragua those original fifty kids who invented this thing had grown up already and there were these younger generations of kids coming in behind them growing up with the language using it inventing new signs. And at a certain point she got curious to just compare the original signers the older kids to the younger kids.    Yeah.   In terms of how they signed.      So we show everyone this old one minute cartoon about this guy who is trying to fly. He sees a bird flying and he puts all these feathers onto his body and he climbs up to the top of the mountain. Flaps his arms and jumps and crashes on the ground   So she showed deaf kids of different generations this cartoon. And asked them pretty simply to describe    What they saw.   Just describe it in sign.    To describe the whole story.   The differences were striking.    So um   First of all.    So I will just show you an example of each.   So youre opening up a movie here.    So this is a first cohort talking about   She got out her laptop and showed me some video.  First of this woman in her forties with dark hair and a colorful t-shirt. She was one of the original signers.  And when you see older signers like her describe this guy whos trying to fly it is really spastic.  It is almost like they become the cartoon.  Shes flapping her hands.    So   Moving all around.    A lot of full body movements.  She is talking about someone whos moving in a crazy way she is gonna be moving in a crazy way. And um   Then she showed me a young kid who was about eight with a backwards cap    So here's Sylvester and now he talks about the manner.   When he described the man jumping and falling it was all in the wrist.    All the movement is now in the hand and its very   Stylish    You know they are trimming these signs down.   But more to the point there was one thing she noticed that was really unexpected had nothing to do with movement.    Could not help noticing that they  the people different people in the community talked about different things in this story. The older signers tended to describe all the events in this story.   And only the events.    And the younger kids.   They would talk about the guy's feelings.    That this guy was trying to fly wanted to fly but failed.   The kids she says just seem to be better at-    Thinking about-   Thinking.    Thinking.   Like other people's thinking. So Ann and Jennie decided let us take all the different generations of deaf kids    Forty year olds. Thirty year olds. Twenty year olds.  Ten year olds.   Let me test them on how well they can think about thinking. So what they did was they showed everybody a comic strip different from before.  This one's about two brothers.    There is a Big Brother who is playing with the train and the little brother is wanting to play with the train. And the big brother puts it under the bed and goes into the kitchen to eat a sandwich.   And maybe before he goes he looks a little brothers and says Hey! Dont touch my train dont touch it!    And then little brother while the big brother is out of the room takes the train out and hides it in the toy box. And then the big brother comes back and the question is where is the big brother going to go to find his train. Is he going to look under the bed or is he going to look in the toy box?  00   Well he is gonna look under the bed   Yep   Because as far as he knows thats where he left it.   Yeah.    He did not see it move.   And if you ask kids over the age of five most of them would say hes gonna look under the bed because thats where he left it and he does not know that it is been moved to the toy box. But here's the thing when she asked the older signers-    They would say oh look in the toy box.   Really?    They would pick the wrong one.  These are thirty-five year olds.   35 year olds would get this wrong?    They would fail this test yeah.   Seven out of eight she says.    And then all of younger signers that we worked with passed.   At this point she is just confused.  Like why would this be? Why cannot the older people pass the simple test that involves thinking about someone else is thinking? What is going on here? And then it occurred to her it might have something to do with certain words because the older signers they do not really have so many words. For the concept of-    Thinking.   I mean they have mainly just one sign pointing at your forehead.    Yeah.   Basically you just point at your forehead with your index finger.  But by the time you get to the younger kids. They have got tons of words for thinking.    Things like I know something and I know that you do not know it.   I know something and I know you do know it. Theyve got a sign for understand believe.    Believe remember forget.   How many roughly were there?    Ten or twelve. Wow! So from thirty years we go from just a couple to    We went from knowing and not knowing.   To twelve?    Yeah.   And somehow that makes all the difference.  She says the more of these think words you have got. The more you can think. Am I right to say that? Youre tiptoeing toward that    Yeah.   But maybe you do not want to go there all the way?    Yeah Im trying to think thatI guess I I do not think it is so simple that you could just go in and say hey Im going to teach you ten signs today and now suddenly you are gonna have better cognitive capacity.   But you are saying though that the verb think    Ahuh.   Is somehow implicated in my ability to think about your thinking.    Right.      Thinking about thinking. Understanding how other people understand. That is something that having language makes you better at.   There are certain words she says that dont just give you a name for something somehow they give you access to a concept that would otherwise be really hard to get or even talk about. It is really hard to talk about thoughts without the word thoughts.  Or what is time without the word time? Its a really freaking hard concept. These words are like bridges. Somehow they get you to some new mental place that otherwise youd be cut off from. But thats sad though these young kids have something that the people who actually invented the language dont.    But we went back two years later tested the same people. And then suddenly some of them were performing a lot better than they had the two years before on the same kinds of tasks.   You mean the older signers?    Yeah   They were passing suddenly?    Some of them were passing yeah.   What happened?    What happened in the past two years?   Yeah!    Those younger kids grew up and started hanging out at the deaf association.   Wait what?     So what had happened in the mean time   So here's the strange twist to the whole thing the death association is this place where the older signers would hang out.    Yeah its a social club.   So theyd play chess do whatever. Well at a certain point these youngsters start showing up you know cuz theyve graduated and they wanna hang out at the deaf association too. But they bring with them all of their new    Mental verbs.   You know all these words for thinking. They start using it with the older kids.  The older kids pick it up. Suddenly these older kids are now passing the test!   So there was learning that took place in adulthood that actually gives them new insight into other people's thinking and motivation and now they can pass these tasks.   Thats super interesting    So that is the story. It is really cool.     Ann Senghas is an associate professor of psychology at Barnard College in New York.   The thing of course is you wonder once you have gotten these this new facility in you There is a lot of literature about this My Fair Lady is about this.   My Fair Lady is about this?   Yeah. It is about a woman who learns proper English and she can no longer be a flower girl in Covent Garden.  Shes now a lady.   Oooohhhh yeah I guess it is kind of like this.   You wonder like remember our program began with that the story of Ildefonso?   Right which he heard from Susan Schaller. Ildefonso was the guy who for 27 years had no language at all.   So you kind of wonder like what happened to Ildefonso once he got language   Right and after that first breakthrough where Ildefonso realized things have names Susan ended up leaving for a few years.   Lets seeit was about four years I think four or five.   But then she decided to write a book about him.   And so I went and found him again.  And he had language and I could ask him all kinds of questions.   Were you able then to sit down with him and ask him about his life and really get the sort of his biography?   Some what some what. One area that everyone wants to know about is what it was like to be languageless.  You know what was going on in his head   Yeah.   And I asked and I asked. And I asked.  And he starts telling me that was the dark time in his life. Learning language is like the lights went on and I tell him well we know about language and we want to know what its like not to have language and he does not wanna talk about it.   But there was a day she says when she was writing the book and she met Ildefonso in a restaurant and there he was sitting with his brother Mario who should never met before. And she quickly learned that Mario also was deaf.   And languageless.   Really?   So I was shocked and because I was so amazed going I cannot believe you have a languageless brother that is when Ildefonso said Well let let me introduce you to some of my friends.   So they get in the car and they drive for awhile we stop at this apartment.  We walk into this small little room and there were these six Mexican men doing this mime routine.   Wait all of these guys were like Ildefonso use to be?   They had no language.   Wow.   They were all deaf and they didnt know they were deaf.   And what what were they doing?   One man would stand up and he would start miming.  He would just start acting out a bull fight.  So hed be the bull and hed be charging and then hed be the matador and then hed be somebody in the crowd watching. And then he would add a detail.   For example   A hat.   And then they would swap so then another guy would get up to take over the story.   Then theyd start miming.   Theyd reenact the matador describe the hat but now the second storyteller would add a new detail.   Like another person with a pair of glasses or something.   So each one would stand up take the bullfight the same bullfight to a different point and add a detail?   Exactly exactly.   Oh my God.   In other words it would take them maybe 45 minutes to say Do you remember the time when we were at the bullfight and this woman did such and such? It was like drawing a picture.   Let me ask you a pull it altogether question.  I was about to think that what a language is is a great connector but this last story makes me wonder. These are five men really sharing and connecting on details so is the difference that language makes just efficiency or does it affect your heart or your whole way of?  I cannot tell I am not sure anymore.   Well I am getting Ildefonsos answer which when I saw him a couple of years later after this incident I asked him about his friends and he said he could not talk to them anymore. He he was not willing to go through that tedious effort of all the miming anymore. But the interesting thing that he said is that he cant even think that way anymore.  He said he cannot think the way he used to think and when I pushed him to ask about what it was like to be languageless the closest he ever came to any kind of an answer was exactly that. I do not know I do not remember. I think differently now.   Susan Schaller author of the book A Man without Words.
