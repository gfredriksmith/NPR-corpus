   Okay so for this one we are gonna begin with a conversation between Jad ...   There you are. Okay there you are.   Can I drink this mysterious cup of water?   And Lulu Miller.   Yeah. I mean if you wanna take your life in your own hands you know I think ...   She is a writer radio producer co-created Invisibilia. And years ago used to work here at Radiolab with me.   Um ...   Its probably fine.   All right Im going.   Do it.   And back when we were just getting started thinking about this series Lulu came to Jad because she had this story she would been working on. And after they talked Jad came to me and said I just heard this wild story from Lulu. You have gotta include it in this series you are doing on intelligence.   So here we go. So this I guess -- so this whole thing begins with a guy and his name is Mark Bold.   Mark Bold.   Mark Bold.   B-O-L-D Bold?   Nice to meet you!   B-O-L-D Bold.   Oh not at all.   Hes the director of the Christian Law Institute and I met him at his offices in Lynchburg Virginia. Hes a big guy. Bald head. Bright blue eyes. Kind of baby face.   Yeah. Okay so I guess take me back to law school. Set the scene. How old are you? Where are you?   Yeah. How old am I? It is gotta be I would say about 39.   So back in 2010 he was in law school.   Went to Liberty University School of Law.   It was his first year of law school. He was taking this class.   Called Foundations. Its just some of these foundational laws that we have.   Some of the basics.   Brown versus Board of Education.   Roe v. Wade.   And so ...   He had this moment that like we have all probably had. This moment where youre sitting in class and you are kind of tuning out. And then you hear something that is like What? What? What did they just say?   Yeah. Yeah.   His professor had just mentioned this Supreme Court case ...   Buck versus Bell.   Buck v. Bell.   Was not Buck v. Bell enforced sterilization?   Yes.   Id never heard of the case but it is a case in Ill say 1927 it originally started. And the Supreme Court held eight to one ...   That it is legal for a state to forcibly sterilize its own citizens who are deemed quote unquote unfit.   Three generations of imbeciles. Is that from this case?   Its that case. Exactly.   This is Oliver Wendell Holmes right?   Exactly.   Three generations of imbeciles are enough. And I was blown away by that decision. It reminded me of Germany. Kind of Nazi this idea that were gonna you know forcibly sterilize our citizens. Its constitutional to do that for the betterment of its citizens for the betterment of society.   But the thing that really shocked him the most which again you might also be aware because you are a now legal scholar nerd but I didnt know when I first heard about this about two years ago is that Buck v. Bell has never been overturned.   Hmm.   And he is like ...   Just totally dumbfounded if you will that we ...   Like how could this still be on the books?   Well I feel like I should say that like if you look at the law you will find that there are all kinds of bad rulings like that. These terrible laws from our horrible past that have somehow stuck around. But the idea is that no one's gonna act on it. It is just sitting there.   So that ...   In theory.   Okay so that sound bite what you just said Nobody's gonna act on it. In theory. That wasnt enough for Mark.   I became obsessed with it obsessed with wanting to know more about Buck versus Bell. Where does it stand today?     And that question ...   Hi this is Mark. I talked ...   Would end up sending Mark off on this journey.   Find out what steps ...   Gonna do a motion for sterilization.   To these places in America to these people in America where Buck v. Bell has not stayed buried in some book.   What was she housed in here or sterilized?   Where this case has very alive and kicking.   Im Pat Walters. And this is episode four of G a Radiolab mini-series. And today were gonna feature this story from Lulu about sterilization laws in the United States because it uncovers a very dark side to our attempts to measure the human mind and fit people into boxes. And reaches out into the present day in ways I honestly never expected. And also because the story of how we got to Buck v. Bell is all tangled up in the history of the IQ test that we got into in our first episode. And it begins with this guy who sort of looms over all of it a guy I first heard about from writer Siddharta Mukherjee.   Francis Galton.   Yes Galton. This British gentleman in the 1880s.   That is historian Paul Lombardo. Anyway. Francis Galton he was this British scientist. Kind of a polymath.   Categorizer of all things.   Categorizer of all things.   Great measurer. I mean he apparently walked around London with a pen in his pocket and a piece of paper quantifying the number of women that he found were attractive.   Oh.   On the left side of his pocket. On -- it is an apocryphal story. And on the right side the women that he did not find attractive to get a statistical measure of attractiveness.   He was like obsessed. He measured everything.   He measured everything. The size of a skull the height of humans.   And the other thing kinda crazy thing is he was related to Charles Darwin.   They were cousins.   And when Darwin publishes his opus On The Origin of Species Francis Galton picks up his cousin's book gives it a little skim and like it completely shook him. And his idea was that this mysterious force of natural selection which seems to kind of invisibly naturally shape creatures into their most perfect forms man could harness this and do the work of nature but faster and better. Because through his measuring his statistics his research Galton had become convinced that wasnt just you know like physical traits that got passed down from generation to generation.   But also mental traits. The ability to think clearly the ability to remember well.   Galton was certain ...   All those things could be inherited.   And not just physical and mental but ...   Moral characteristics and traits could be inherited.   Galtons idea was that if you could measure everything if you could measure these human qualities then you could breed people just like you bred animals.   Breed for the traits you want breed out the ones you do not.   If you did this selectively he really thought that he would make a better human race.   And he comes up with a word.   Eugenics.   Which is Greek for good birth.   Is that what eugenics means?   Yeah.   He wants eugenics to be a program of better breeding.   So he starts you know touring Europe giving these lectures on this idea of how you could create a happier healthier society. And he publishes magazine articles about it.   Did he ever describe his vision for how this would work? Like practically? Like how he would go about doing it?   Yes. Yeah. This part I feel like less people know about. He actually goes and writes a sci-fi novel called Kantsaywhere.   Kantsaywhere.   Yeah.   Interesting.   He never published it but his -- and then after he died his niece tried to destroy it. But a lot of it has been salvaged and typed up. Do you want to hear some of it? I actually have it.   Yeah totally.   I should say Im really tempted to do this in a fake British accent but what do you think?   Go for it.   Okay. Okay.   Okay. So I should say that they lay much stress on the aesthetic side of things at Kantsaywhere.   So it is set in a fictional town called Kantsaywhere.   Grace and Thoroughness is a motto carved over one of the houses for girls in the college.   And ...   The physique of the girls reminded me ...   Like the people themselves of Kantsaywhere he describes them as ...   Promising mothers of a noble race.   The good stock.   As for the men they are well-built practiced both in military drill and athletics.   They are very handsome and virile but very modestly dressed.   Gay without frivolity friendly without gush and intelligent without brilliancey.   They never -- they never gossip.   A loutish boy and an awkward girl hardly exist in this place.   And the reason why people are so perfect in Kantsaywhere is that everyone who enters this society has to take these tests. They have to take all sorts of physical tests. Medical tests and athletic tests aesthetic tests and if you do well youre given all this money and encouraged to have tons of babies. But if you dont do well ...   Such persons are undesirable as individuals and dangerous to the community.   You are sent to a labor camp told you are never allowed to have babies. And if you do ...   A crime against the state.   It is considered a criminal act.   Owing to the practical certainty that they will propagate their kind if unchecked.   So Galton's toying around with this fanciful idea but ...   People thought this was a very good idea.   It sort of caught fire.   Intellectuals scholars scientists came to celebrate this idea.   But this is how you get to the Nazis right? I mean this went right into the Nazis right?   Oh my friend it went to Americans first. So this was something I did not realize at all. There was a huge eugenics craze in America in the early 1900s and what historians have explained is that there were all these things going on. There was this wave of immigration there were -- you know it is just after the Civil War so there are freed slaves integrating into society. There were Christians freaking out about crime and promiscuity and drinking. And so all kinds of people really important people thought that these things were problems and that the way to solve it was eugenics. And one of these people is whom I am writing the book about. This is how I crashed into all this.   Oh this is your Stanford guy!   By the way Lulu's writing a book. It is coming out soon. It is about this guy David Starjordan.   Yeah so my dude was like one of the earliest loudest most powerful proponents of eugenics.   Got it.   You can see like in the late 1800s which is decades before most American eugenicists got the fever he is slipping it into his courses at Stanford. So he is like telling smart people these ideas that poverty is linked to the blood and can be exterminated. He would trot these ideas out in front of like Benjamin Franklin's 200th birthday party in the late-1800s where there is hundreds of politicians gathered. And he says you know this is a matter of life and death for the nation. And he said the Republic will endure only as long as the human harvest is good.   Eww. That is a horrible phrase.   And he wrote -- this is a book. This is -- okay I swear we are almost done. We are almost done with the history. But then he decided to write a whole book about it.   He wrote a book called the Human Harvest?   I am holding it right here.   What a horrible title!   It is -- and it is horrible inside. He tells -- to scare people he tells people about this town in Italy called Aosta which for about 1300 years was this sort of refuge for people you know with disabilities or deformities. People would send them there and the church would take care of them. And then they could often get married and they work the fields and have families and they are helped by the church and some people see that as this beautiful tale of like helping society's most vulnerable. And he went there and he wrote about it as a veritable chamber of horrors. Basically he says -- he describes the people living there and say they have less decency than the pig and he like says that it is a different -- it is a subspecies of human. And he says this is where you know America's gonna be going if we do not take action.   Let me tell you about it.   Oh yeah so where are we right now?   Yeah we pulled in. I do not know if you really saw the -- the gate the entrance.   Which we totally did. So that day that I was with Mark Bold he drove me to this place that is just a couple miles from his office. It is called the Central Virginia Training Center.   The Training Center.   It is -- it is ominous.   It is.   It is this campus on a hilltop.   Very old buildings.   With dozens of brick buildings.   You see the kind of Roman columns there.   Tall turrets. But theyre all starting to rot.   Starting to become dilapidated as you can see these were some of the first buildings. There is acres and acres and acres here.   And at one point this place was a very real version of Galton's sci-fi dream.   What does this say?   Yep. So this says 'Established in 1910 as the Virginia State Epileptic Colony. The Center admitted its first patients in May 1911. The facility originally served persons with epilepsy and began accepting individuals with mental retardation in 1913.'   So very little on there about the sort of sins of what they have done in the past.   Exactly. Nothing in there. It was established in 1910 really as a eugenics facility and it was a colony really for the epileptic and quote feeble-minded. There is nothing in there that really talks about its main purpose was to house individuals from the community and -- and strip them from society and put them here so they do not propagate their kind. That is really the fundamental reason for its existence.   So this colony was not like alone. There were tons of them popping up all over the country. Like these high-walled holding tanks where people would be kept away from the rest of society and in some cases sterilized. Which when you think about what that really is it is a form of extermination. Like slowly wiping out a certain kind of person.   People with disabilities people with mental illness people who were immigrants people of color. Because they were all seen as not good births.   So this is Ivanova Smith.   An activist advocate and historian.   At the University of Washington. And she explained that people who arrived at these sorts of colonies would be given extensive tests.   And they had different categories and they used this concept called mental age theory to explain these different categories moron imbecile and idiot. And these were all diagnostic terms that were used to put us in institutions and they were used to justify us being sterilized.   So you said us.   Yes.   What do you mean by that?   So I identify with the intellectual disability community. I would have probably been -- back then I would have been put in the moron category. Im autistic and I have intellectual disabilities.   Do you think in the eugenicist day like would you have been someone who was sterilized?   I think I would have because they actually encouraged the sterilization of morons in the early-20th century because we were more likely to be sexually active and you know getting -- you know finding boys boys finding girls you know?   Which brings us back to Buck v. Bell.   Was she housed in here or was she sterilized in here?   And in particular Buck. So Carrie Buck was a girl who grew up in Charlottesville Virginia. She is born in 1906. And she was mostly raised by her foster parents. She lived a kind of totally normal childhood sang in the church choir went to school. But when when she was 17 she says she was raped and she became pregnant out of wedlock. And as a result her foster parents sent her to the Central Virginia Training Center which in those days was called the Colony for Epileptics and Feeble-Minded. And when she got there she met this guy the superintendent named Albert Priddy. So Albert Priddy was a passionate eugenicist. And at the time 1924 there was starting to be some pushback about eugenics from churches social institutions politicians. And so Priddy was on the hunt for the case that would help to legalize eugenics sterilization at the national level. And when Priddy met Carrie he felt like he had hit the jackpot because he realized her mom was there at the colony. Her name was Emma Buck. And she was allegedly a prostitute. And so he had Carrie tested deemed her feeble-minded. And then when he heard that a social worker had called Carrie Buck's baby the product of this rape peculiar he believed he had on his hands proof that feeble-mindedness or unfittedness is linked to the blood.   Hmm.   So he found her. He gives -- he arranges to have a lawyer appointed to her. You have to get a -- before you are sterilized you have like a mini-trial. And so the lawyer appointed to her was this guy Whitehead likely a eugenicist himself. Did not give her a good defense. Did not call forward any witnesses. It makes it all the way up to the Supreme Court where we get that ruling.   Three imbeciles. Okay. So those are the three.   Yeah are Emma Carrie and Vivian.   Hmm.   It was three real people. And ...   And did Buck v. Bell make it nationalized that you could sterilize?   Yes.   I see.   So her case paved the way for over 60000 sterilizations performed all over the country. And that ruling still sits on the books today. Never overturned.   Wow.   All right. Knuckle crack? We have made it through that horrific history.   So were coming back to Bold?   We are coming back to Bold. So Bold is sitting in law school and he is like What?   Exactly. Just totally dumbfounded if you will.   And so he goes to his professor and he is like how has this never been overturned? And then the professor says every state has since overturned it.   All the states repealed their laws. So it has not been overturned because we do not have another quote case or controversy before us.   Which is you know the thing that like all the legal scholars say which is like Well technically it is in this kind of purgatory. Do not worry youre being paranoid. You could not actually get sterilized. Blah blah blah because youre looking for a thing. Okay.    Well okay. Just to sort of like ...   Honor them?   Honor those legal scholars for a second.   Yeah.   I mean there is all kinds of stupid stupid rulings. Like Koramatsu.   Right.   Which we did a big thing about.   Right.   Which basically like round up a whole bunch of citizens that are American citizens but are Japanese Japanese American for no other reason that they are Japanese. That is constitutionally wrong. But they did it and it is still technically good law. So it is kind of in that like oh that sucked but the limbo.   The limbo. Sorry Jad I thought you were gonna say limbo.   No so it is like -- I mean there are other cases there are other really terrible decisions that are in that space.   So that -- tons of people said that to him.   To Bold?   To Bold. To Mark Bold. But Bold ...   I became obsessed with it.   He just was not convinced that this thing was dead.   So I was-- a lot of my free time if you could say that as if you do not have enough to do in law school right? I just started searching the code of each state using keywords of feeble-minded and undesirable and sterilization and eugenics and ...   So he started looking at each and every state law. And he did it alphabetically.   Alabama then Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Florida Georgia Hawaii Idaho Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississ ... going through all the codes and searching. New Hampshire and New Jersey New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Vermont Virginia Washington.   And then finally he gets to ...   West Virginia.   And there he sees it in this West Virginia statute. Chapter 27 Article 16 entitled Sterilization of Mental Defectives.   It is talking about sterilization for the best interest of society.   Was this -- wait ...   This was still on the books.   Still on the books.   It is the year 2012.   Totally dumbfounded. I was like ...   So there was something in the code that basically still said you could be forcibly sterilized if you were unfit. Something ...   Exactly yeah. If you are considered feeble-minded then you -- in the best interest of society you can be sterilized.   Wow. Like oversight? Or was it in use?   Right. So he did not know.   What I did is I wanted to find out do we still do that? If I was a father of a child who had a disability some type of intellectual disability can I forcibly sterilize my daughter ...   So he like gets himself in a zone where he wants to pretend that he has an adult daughter over the age of 21 who he wants to sterilize.   So I called this circuit court.   What -- he was -- he was pretending so he was doing kind of like a sting like a one-man sting?   Yes.   Like let me see if I call the statehouse and say I have a daughter who wants -- who I want sterilized will you do it for me or is that legal?   Yes. And he records the call if you would like to hear it.   Play it.   County Clerks office.   Yes is  there please?   Shes on the phone do you want to hold?   Yeah thatd be great. Thank you.   I think he called -- I think this might be the second time.    speaking.   Hey this is Mark. I talked to you earlier this morning here when I was driving. You called and you told me to call you back if I had any questions or what have you. It is in regards to my handicapped daughter and the sterilization.   Yes yes.   Okay. So I now have the chance to obviously sit down at the desk here. I took some time off work and wanted to find out what steps ...   Youre gonna do a motion for sterilization.   What?   And youre gonna tell the judge the reason why you need that done and you know the situation. And then it will come to me. Ill set a hearing. You guys will have a hearing on it. And the judge will make the decision which more -- most of the times you know they know that this needs to be done. So I do not think that you are gonna have a problem you know?   Okay.   And then we will set a hearing. As soon as I get it Ill get it to  and shell give you a call.   I will just write a letter. Is that what I need to do?   Yes.   Wait. She says most the time the judge ...   Yeah.   And this was 2012?   Yeah.   You are gonna do a motion handwrite your daughters name then under that motion for -- and then write out what you need.   Okay. So Ill say motion ...   And then you put your number on the bottom where we can reach you.   Okay. This is not a -- we are not gonna be the first one to do this. Okay to us we feel weird about it you know what I mean? I mean it is just ...   Oh no sir. You are absolutely not the first ones. A lot of -- this has to be done because we have so many problems with -- yeah you have to do this. Its for her best ...   Exactly. I do not think people understand this type -- you know these type of people they are difficult.   No. You are -- no no you are doing the best thing. The problem is is when we get some that do not do it and then it is a problem you know that has to be dealt with. But no sir you are doing what youre supposed to.   Okay.   Basically the answer is a resounding yes. Needs to be done. It is common. Do not worry about it. I even -- was concerned. Well what if people know will my neighbors know? No it is sealed.   You just send it straight to me and I will get every -- pull the file and get everything taken care of.   Okay. All right. Well thank you so much.   Okay youre welcome.   All right. Bye bye.   Get the  out. Did I just hear that?   Yes. So this ...   Thats insane!   Yeah so really quick a couple of things. First of all to be fair to her it is not officially her job to judge whether or not someone should be sterilized its her job to get that question to a judge. And second of all there is a legal difference between sterilizing someone for eugenic purposes for the good of society. Like there is something wrong with them that may be passed down to the next generation and threaten the race versus sterilizing someone for their own quote-unquote best interest. And there actually are a number of states today that allow for a parent or guardian to have their disabled child sterilized for medical purposes even if that person does not give consent.   Oh because if they have a child they might die kind of a thing?   Yeah and some of the laws even talk about that persons inability to adequately care for a child. So that ...   Do you think the woman who was responding to Mark saying Oh yeah we have done this before with that kind of case in mind or with the more eugenics-y flavored case in mind?   Honestly I do not know. I was able to find her but she said she couldnt comment on this case for the story. And numbers of how frequently sterilizations are done are really hard to find. But what is clear is that at the time of that call the law as it was written in the books one of the reasons why a judge could approve of a sterilization procedure is and I quote That the individual is mentally impaired and that such defect is of a genetic nature that is likely to be passed on to any children. Which is just pure eugenic reasoning.   Right? So it is the general welfare. What is in the best interest of society?   It is not about what is in the person's best interests.   And so I found it disturbing.   So he was horrified.   And I wanted to put the nail in the coffin.   But he also -- this was kind of his like hero genesis moment.   What I did is put out a press release. And in a sense I was wanting to pick a fight. The Christian Law Institute is considering suing West Virginia et cetera over its eugenics forced sterilization law. The Charleston Gazette picked it up.   And his idea was ...   I was really hoping that the state would in a sense defend it. That we can together get it before the Supreme Court and say Hey let us overturn this.   So his dream was like I am gonna reach out to West Virginia and say 'Let us do this thing and you defend the law and then we will get it to the Supreme Court.'   Wait. So his legal strategy was sue it ...   Make them uphold it.   Like on appeal it gets upheld or something. And it just kind of works its way up.   Yeah. But right after the article came out ...   It went before the legislature and they just unanimously repealed it.   Oh! How fast did that happen?   I just was notified of that probably about a couple months after ...   They immediately overturned the law because they were like were West Virginia we dont want to be seen as upholding eugenics sterilization. So great for the people of West Virginia but Mark's bigger plan to overturn Buck v. Bell was foiled.   Hmm.   And so he starts thinking All right. If I cannot find justice for people in the future can I reach back into the past and find it there?   And we will join him on that search after a quick break.       Hey this is Radiolab. We are back with Lulu Miller's story for G. Before the break Mark Bold had gotten his West Virginia law struck down which he was excited about but it also meant he could not use it to challenge Buck v. Bell at the Supreme Court. Back to Lulu.   All right. So Mark starts noticing that West Virginia wasnt some kind of outlier. There were all these other states that had their eugenics sterilization laws on the books until the '80s '90s 2000s.   So I started looking into finding victims. Is there somebody alive you know?   Thinking he could maybe do something to help them. Get them some money. Something. And pretty quickly he found some people.   Good to see you!   Good to see you too.   He introduced me to a bunch of them including this one woman Anna Seal.   I dont know how you feel about pie. Coconut creme?   Who lives just a couple miles from the Central Virginia Training Center which is the colony where Carrie Buck was sterilized. Shes got a sunny two bedroom apartment.   Its so nice in here.   Full of plants.   Is that a bird?   Yeah.   With two birds actually. And her best friend Mary who she met at the Virginia Colony when she was young. So ...   We had nothing but beans and pork and beans every night.   Anna explained that growing up her family was really poor. And things with her parents were bad.   Daddy drank all the time and ...   She said that she and her brothers like often didnt have any clothes.   We had no clothes.   And at one point the neighbors reported that the kids were been living in a pen behind the house.   It was cold and we didnt have no heat.   And pretty soon the authorities came to take them away. Anna was seven.   Do you remember that? Did they come in like a police car or a truck or ...   I think a car.   She and her brothers were driven to the Central Virginia Training Center. She was given a bunch of tests. And they decided that Anna was ...   Feeble-minded.   Feeble-minded.   Retarded. Yeah.   They issued her an inmate number cut her hair.   I didnt want -- I didnt want that to happen.   They were often forced to wait outside in the cold rain to wait for food. They had to work with no pay. Years went by and Anna was told she could leave just agree to be sterilized. But she said no. She had always wanted to have kids and so she said no. And ironically all that time her job at the colony was to care for kids.   I used to give them baths. You know help give them baths every other night.   You would give them a bath?   They cannot take care of themselves. I love kids. But I wasnt you know -- yeah.   And one day when she was 19 years old two nurses came and said they were gonna give her a checkup and they gave her a mask of what she thinks was ether and she felt the world slipping away. And she was like -- she figured she was being euthanized.   I was gone. I thought I wasnt gonna wake up.   She thought that this was it.   I woke up.   And did you know when you woke up what had happened?   No. Uh-uh.   What is it -- is it still -- do you still have a scar?   Yeah still got the scar. I think about it every day you know?   So over about two years Mark found about a dozen people who would been sterilized in Virginia.   I would just sit there and weep you know? With my -- as I would listen to them tell their stories about how they were taken from their families and what happened here and -- you know?   So he goes down to the Virginia State General Assembly and he brings them -- brings Anna with him. She remembers it.   So what he wants at this point is an apology?   Yes. He wants a bill ...   to get some type of compensation for victims who were forcibly sterilized.   So he goes down to the Virginia state government and he makes this appeal. He says Virginia was where the first Supreme Court-sanctioned sterilization happened. Virginia should be the first to compensate its victims. And they basically pass.   Like as in No thank you?   Yeah.   What did -- what did they say?   Well Mark says in his opinion he thinks it was pretty much just about ...   Ugh money. They call themselves conservative but theyre so fiscally conservative ...   He says that one of the things that was so frustrating about this was that he didnt really have the support of like his people.   People who -- Im Republican just for what its worth. We have this idea of pro-family. And here you have these guys at least championing that and Im like What more of a pro-family -- how about the right to have a family? You know what Im saying? If you say you are pro-family you know you are pro-life how about the right to give life you know what I am saying? And so it just seemed so hypocritical to me. I just find it repugnant. It still makes me angry to this day right?   Yeah your face just changed. It is like a deep soul disappointment.   Yeah. Yeah because again ...     But just a few months later ...     He and a team of lawmakers and activists convinced North Carolina to pass a bill.     And they award everyone who is been sterilized 50000 and they say they are sorry. And then a couple years later Virginia passes it. But then Virginia only gives 25000 which he just felt like was such an unnecessary slight.   But for Anna ...   We got paid.   So what does that mean? Is it like ...   It helps. She gets about 50 a week. And she uses it to help with the groceries with bills.   And the cable.   And she used a chunk of it to treat her friend Mary to a present.   Oh hello little guy!   After Mary had got some hard news she went out and got her a hamster.   Who is that?   Sugarfoot.   Sugarpuff?   Sugarfoot.   Just to cheer her up. Anna spends her time hanging out with her neighbors. She goes to church. She feeds her birds.   Did you do that one?   Yeah I did these right here.   She colors.   Okay. And whats this guy?   A bear.   Surfing.   Yeah. And a dog here. And a bear too.   And this ones kayaking. Wow and theyre really bright!   And she takes care of her best friend Mary. You know when I was there she was constantly getting up to refill Marys drink. Mary walks with a cane now and Anna kept refreshing her glass of iced tea. She even set up Mary with her most recent boyfriend.   Howd you know him? Howd you meet him?   He said he was looking for a friend. And I said Mary will be your friend.    You said 'Not me?   But as much as this apartment is filled with laughter and life you can still see that this loss this theft really she carries it.   Okay so what are we looking at?   We got dolls. Doll babies.   Doll babies on your bed. A boy and a girl?   Uh-huh.   Do they have names?   Yeah.   What are their names?   Thats Bobby.   Bobby.   Thats little Mary.   So thats Mary and whos this?   Anna.   And whose is yours?   This is mine right here.   Yours is Mary.   Mary.   And Marys is ...   She says she brings the doll with her to church on the bus.   Do you bring her like shopping? Grocery store?   Oh I take her everywhere I go.   And why? I mean is it like ...   Oh because I love kids. And I wanted to have kids but I couldnt even though I want to you know? Settle down and get married but I didnt have no kids.   So is it kinda like shes become a kid?   Yeah.   She is a kid!   She is a kid.   For me what astounds me the most is like the way that eugenicists talk its always about the good of society saving the race saving the nation. It is the obsession with the future and with perfection and a master race. They say that its science that if you just look -- if you read Darwin and you apply his principles this is how we make a better race.   Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.   But the thing that like they all somehow happen to miss in On the Origin of Species is how frequently Darwin talks about one thing this one ingredient that he marvels at. He doesnt understand why its there but it is the thing to which we all owe our existence on Earth. What is that one ingredient? Variation.   Huh.   Variation it is the engine of natural selection of beings being created more perfectly. It is what you know when a gene pool is too homogeneous it is weaker.   Mm-hmm.   And so the eugenicists by breeding out variation were in a way foiling their very own plot of building a master race.   Yeah. Like who gets to say what we need you know? Theres a humility built into the theory of natural selection which just gets immediately -- immediately distorted with social Darwinism.   Right.   Because its like We decide.   Exactly. And I think often times this story seems like it is past tense like it is over. But that hubris is still in our laws today. I mean I talked earlier about those laws which are supposedly different from the eugenics sterilization laws the laws where you are allowed to sterilize someone in their best interests.   Those statutes are still controversial.   As Paul Lombardo explains when you really dig down into the language these laws are still saying there are some times when we should be making the decision for someone else about whether or not they should have children.   I think your inclination is correct. There are reports of abuse and there certainly are opportunities for abuse in this case. These are powers of the state which we should -- which we should be incredibly suspicious of.   Hey this is Pat. I just wanna jump in quick. First of all this story is so intense. But -- and I guess I just kind of have one question at the end about that last thing you were talking about Lulu.   Yeah?   So there are these laws that are different than the eugenics sterilization laws that I guess still allow for involuntary sterilization like by a parent or guardian. I guess Im just wondering like have you heard about that happening?   Yeah. No I talked to parents. I talked to parents -- two parents actually who are struggling with this right now. I talked to a mom who has a son with severe disabilities and who is approaching adulthood. She is like watching him you know grow into a mans body with man's desires and thinking about sex.   Oh. And she is like worried that he would get someone pregnant.   Yeah. And worrying that like she doesnt think there would be any way he would be able to care for a kid.   Hmm.   And so in her mind she has entertained the thought. Like would he oddly be able to live a freer life if he could have sex and have romantic relationships without the worry of getting somebody pregnant.   Yeah wow. That is just like a -- an impossibly difficult place to be sitting as a parent.   Yeah. I think that there are parents family members grappling with this question in a really private hard way. Like is there some line where someone is so severely disabled they should not be allowed to have kids.   Okay so in those types of situations ...   This is Ivanova Smith the historian and disabilities advocate we heard from before. When I talked to her about this she says when it comes to looking for that line ...   I think its really dangerous because that line moves. And so having that line is -- I get what youre saying that there needs to be a line there needs to be some point. But at the same time my fear and many people in the disability community's fear is that its arbitrary. And it all depends on like the policies and the politics.   And like who is deciding where that line is? Is it a parent a guardian someone appointed by the state?   All of that. Its scary for us I guess for the disability community. Its scary to talk about the line because that means we have to leave somebody out.   And Ivanova says if she had been born in a different time or even in slightly different circumstances she would have been left out.   If I had not been adopted I would have been way below that line.   Wow! So where did you -- where were you an orphan?   I was in Soviet-occupied Latvia. And I was born with clubfeet on both of my feet and they diagnosed me with my developmental disabilities and they diagnosed me with autism. And I never learned my native language because the orphanage was never able to teach me my native language. And I lived in the orphanage for ...   You werent speaking at all?   I was -- I was babbling when I was five and a half.   And soon after that she was adopted by an American couple.   I came to Washington State and ...   Eventually learned to talk. Went to school which could be difficult because as she puts it she had a very visible disability.   Like I rock.   So she would be sitting there in her chair moving her body back and forth.   The ways that my movements are it is just kind of awkward.   Had learning disabilities.   I also -- I have a hard time regulating my emotions sometimes.   She would have little outbursts. Break down in tears.   So sometimes I need like support.   But she kept going. Made it through school. Eventually started dating.   We dated for 10 years before we got married. And then I had no idea that that one Valentine's Day that we decided not to use a condom  ...   In 2017 she got pregnant. And she was terrified.   A lot of my peers were like Oh you shouldnt have kids.   Her whole life basically people had been telling her like You cant be a mother.   You would be dangerous.   And she had started to believe them.   I agreed with them.   She worried about all these things.   Yeah like I would not -- like I forget to feed them. Or like I have depth perception issues. And so I was like afraid that I would like trample over them or like drop them.   And worse than that ...   I dont understand other peoples emotions. And so I was scared that I would not have that nurturing feeling.   Like she would look at the baby and just feel confused. Or nothing.   And I remember calling my mom when I found out that you know I was pregnant. I was -- I told my mom I was scared. But my mom was like Im gonna be here for you and we are gonna get through this. And this is gonna be -- and this is -- we are so excited. Like they were so excited. When I first went to the doctor's to confirm the pregnancy test there was a nurse trying to give me paperwork about the abortion pills. And I said it to them then Theres a little human being inside me. And Im gonna raise -- I am gonna do my best to love them. I am scared to death. I am terrified but I am gonna do the best I can. And I did not start really enjoying it until she came out of me.   Hmm.   And they put her on me. This little tiny little thing this little peanut. She had the biggest eyes. Like I usually cannot look at people in the eyes but her eyes were just so big. And she looked wide-eyed at me and I just -- like all of those like nurturing instincts I think they just came at once. I knew what to do. I got to cuddle her and -- and I gave her snuggles. She does not care that I rock and she doesnt care that I talk to myself. Shes just a happy little snuggle and she loves me unconditionally and I love her. And I think she is made me a better person. Creating that little human it was the most amazing moment of my life. And shes just such a blessing you know? I cannot imagine life without that little girl. And you know there was that one time where I would have been told that it would have been for my best interest to have been sterilized.   And what do you say to someone who just says you know Oh you rock and you get so -- you have a meltdown getting on the bus. And you might not -- you cant drive her and you shouldnt -- that they worry about her safety. I mean what do you say to them? What do you say to someone who still thinks Oh no is your little girl gonna be okay in your care?   I would say to them that do you see that in my little girls face?     Oh the little lamb is gonna tickle the peanut. That little lamb is tickling the peanut!   Do you see that when shes laughing her little heart out when Im giving her a hug?     Thats a yellow one though. That is that yellow Jeep.   Do you see that when shes coming to me saying Muti muti muti you know?     Thats right! Yep thats yellow. Thats the yellow Jeep.   I would tell them to presume competence to presume that we could be good parents. Give us that chance.     Reporter Lulu Miller. Lulu has a book coming out soon.
