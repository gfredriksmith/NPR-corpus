 A good way to begin is to say All I want you to do is focus on the sensations in your body right now your shoulders your neck wherever there might be tension just notice. But I do not want you to release the tension just yet. I want you to just notice. It is nice to notice from time to time. So take your time. These changes are slowly beginning. And feel free to rejoin me right now.  Well it strikes me that the tools of a hypnotist are not so different from the tools of a broadcaster.  Mm-hmm.  I am Simon Adler. This is Mixtape. And we are starting off today with Lloyd.  Yeah Lloyd Glauberman. I am a psychologist in Manhattan. I practiced on West 86th Street for a long time.   Lloyd's a skinny guy oft-times sports a blazer and jeans. And as you heard there he is a hypnotist.  Hypnosis is always interesting to me. So I went to graduate school took some workshops.  And built himself a practice. And a couple years in he started to wonder like would it be possible for him to hypnotize someone from afar? Now not in the super villain hypno-ray sense but instead just with his voice on a cassette tape.  That is correct. Right.  Okay.  So I tried to create a recorded hypnotic audio experience.  Now I have listened to a lot of cassettes over the last year and what he made is definitely one of the stranger things I have come across. When you press play the first thing you hear is this relaxing ambient music.  So set the stage. You listen to this automatically you start relaxing. And then ...    ... two simultaneously told magical fairy tales start up. One in each ear.  Okay.    Now if you are a little confused good! Because you are not actually supposed to follow these two stories.  The whole idea is I want your conscious mind to drift away.  Because Lloyd thought if he managed to get you into some altered state you would then be able to receive the secret messages that he was hiding in these stories.  Okay I am going to tell you the trick how the trick is done right now. I am going to expose the contents of this idea.  Almost like those trick images that you have to cross your eyes to see. In these tapes if you want to hear it what you have to do is listen to what is being said between the two stories. So for example if the story in the right ear says ...  The word Feel ...  In the left ear what followed was ...  The word Better.  Okay.   So the listener at that moment in time the only thing that is actually available for that split two seconds is ...   As if I were giving you a direct suggestion to feel better.   Now Lloyd went on to make a bunch of these tapes. And I gotta say I think they are both beautiful and a little bit crazybut mostly beautiful. But either way they were definitely indicative of this larger trend.   When the cassette tape hit its stride ...   ... self-help as an industry really took off.    And not just hypnosis tapes but instructional tapes.   Like this one for Windows 95. Or this one ...   Teaching you how to fly an airplane. I mean there were ...   ... fitness and workout tapes.    Sales marketing and business tapes.   And tons and tons of new age spirituality and self-improvement tapes. And while yes these instructional tapes can be dry and the self-help-y ones can be hokey ...   I have to admit they are actually what got me hooked on cassette tapes in the first place because if you stop listening to what they are saying and instead listen for how they are saying itwhen they deploy repetition where they use I and Youwhat you then hear is people experimenting with this new medium. And you can hear how this new technology so hi-fi and personalized and on demand completely changed what was possible in terms of impacting really transforming the person who was listening.  There was something aboutthere was something about a cassette that provides connection right?  Hmm.  It is a connecting device from thisfrom this bit of tape to your brain. And so suddenly there was intimacy. And that changed everything.      This is the final episode in this Mixtape miniseries and I am gonna wrap it up with two stories of tapes made to help. First up     ... memory tapes.  So you are up in Syracuse.  Yes. I am currently a professor of anthropology at Syracuse University.  And if I can ask how the hell did you get to Syracuse New York?   Ask me again. Exactly.   This is Jok Madut Jok.  So the in-laws.  The in-laws.  The in-laws. Indeed.  And back in South Sudan where he grew up he was known for having a crazy good memory.  I had almost instant capacity to record a two-hour song in my mind.  Oh really?  Absolutely.  Which gave him a sort of special place in his community. Folks with this talent actually had a title.  Yeah it is called Ping.  Ping.  Yeah. I think literally it means The Hearer. But a Ping is sort of the human recorder because in South Sudan literacy came there quite late. And even as literacy comes it is only touched a few people. So a majority of the people are oral.  Mm-hmm.  And so the history of one's family it was not written down.  Okay.  So the way Dinka and our people used to record their history was ...   ... in songs.   And this was done on an individual level. So over the course of your life you would write or have written for you sort of an album of songs each capturing a phase in your life.  And so there are singers people like Deng Bin Jok.  Okay.  And when you are about towhen you are sort of eligible to get married what do you do? You go to Deng Bin Jok with your story with your history.  You tell him about yourself important events in your life. But then also you would sing for him or tell him portions of your parents' songs portions of their parents' songs.  So what Deng Bin Jok does is he takes a few days to mull it over. You see him murmuring to himself walking in slow steps. And then one day he can wake you up in the middle of the night and say I have your song.   In the middle of the night?  Yeah.  And one of Jok's uncles he actually had Deng write one of these songs for him.  I mean it is long. It will go on for an hour two hours. But just to give you a flavor of how the song goes ...  And so on and so on.  This two-hour song I imagine almost like a family photograph with Jok's uncle sitting in the center surrounded by his parents and relatives on all sides. And in that way this song all at once documented his past situated him inside of it and provided sort of a roadmap for his future.  These songs play a role in all this as a frame of reference something that you can use to help you cope with the life in general.  This is John Thon Majok.  Director of Grants Management at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for scholars.  Lots more from him in a minute. But first here's the thingbecause this song is so long and perhaps because by the time Deng finishes singing it he does not remember the beginning of it. Deng only sings this masterpiece for you once.  So you better be ready to record.  Which brings us back to those human recorders like Jok those Pings.  If you are not very good at doing this the trick is for you is to come with a Ping who can capture the song in their mind because then on your way back home with that person the person would repeat it for you. And then you will have learned the whole thing.  After you have learned your song you sing it for others. They start singing it sampling pieces of it into their own future songs.  And it is handed down and the fact that I can sing it some 50 years later even more actually because it was sang before I was born.  Right it works.  It works. It works yeah.  Unfortunately though this ancient form of remembering and meaning-making the Dinka had developed collided with a genocide bent on erasing them. In 1983 ...  The North indiscriminately attacked. It was a reign of terror.  And this genocide this reign of terror it would require a whole new way of remembering. I mean across the entirety of the South these horrible reports and rumors began circulating.  Accounts of murder at the hands of the Sudanese army accounts of people being thrown in wells and mass graves. People being dragged out of their homes.  Daytime was not safe.  This is Maketh Bul Maboir.  I was born in southern Sudan in a small town called Wonkele.  And he said he remembers hiding for days as the war closed in on his village.  You hear people in the army soldiers coming to survey the area to see if there are people in that location. So you cannot get water you cannot get food.  He was only seven at the time so he was not really aware of what was going on. But he now knows that the soldiers were looking for him.  Yeah young people were the target because they were the potential army.  And so my mom and my dad made that choice that leadmove the kid away from this. So they just sat us down and say Guys I know it is not a easy decision but we think it will be the safe decision for you to go.  And so that night ...  ...because night time was safe to walk I and my sister have to leave. She have to hold my hand and be so close to me.  And as they hurried through the night they began running into other kids.  It started from five. The next day 20 70 200. It keep forming forming and forming and forming and forming.  So it is like people in a crowd.  Again John Thon Majok.  Just walking together moving to the east.  Parents all across the south including John Thon's had made the same gut-wrenching decision and sent their children fleeing down dirt roads and along hidden paths in the dead of night.  As I later learned there were 16 to 20000 kids. The parents were not with us.  Many people thought the war and having to hide would only last for like a week.  But it would take years to see them again. I talked to my mom when I was 19 years old.  Wait that was theit took 12 years?  Yeah that was the first time to talk to her.  Now if you know any part of this story it is probably this part ...     These boys like John Thon and Maketh Bul became sort of a media sensation.   They were even given this name ...         ... the Lost Boys.    They just were not there. Even shoes you can put them on. And later on I of course because it was a long journey all the shoes worn out and you have to walk barefoot.  What John Thon Maketh Bul and the thousands of others like them had to do and managed to do is unimaginable. And I mean what came next was not much easier. They ended up in Kenya in this refugee camp called Kakuma.   The camp was big. Like a big city.  Different from their villages in every way. It was crammed with people housed in row after row after row of these basically barracks made out of canvas or sheet metal or cement.   And it was tough. We realized we are no longer around the cattle we are no longer around our parents.  So at nighttime at the evening time when we come together there were a couple songs that we used to know when we used to live in the village. And so ...   ... somebody will sing a song.   So those things become a sort of our comfort.   Things went on like this for years. The boys grew into men. Some of their family members and elders were able to move and join them in Kakuma. And then one day ...   This list showed up.   It was a list of names of those who were being resettled.   I was running jumping up and down.  Maketh Bul saw his name on that list.  And I was told that I was coming to Chicago.  And while this is what he would wanted ...  You were praying you were giving your energy your thought anything because this is like aAmerica was like a gateway for your life.  He and others were suddenly worried as well.  Again we were going far away.  John Thon's name was on that list too.  And we knew now we will not be sitting around the fire and listening to our elders telling all their stories. We will not be in the cattle camp anymore so things can get lost.  I mean In America there was not going to be anyone to teach them their families' songs their history. And no one knew when or if they would ever return.  And so while we have a few elders alive the way to capture this is to record them. And at that point we had access to the tape the cassette.  Just a few years prior what had arrived in Kakuma but these cassette recorders.  We realized the device itself can store this story of the society.  No writing was required. And these tapes could travel just in your pocket collapsing space and time.  You can hear the voice of a singer that you have not seen ever.  And so guys like John Thon became sort of amateur historians.   Recording the songs of their family members that had joined them in Kakuma.   Can we stop there for a minute?  Yeah yeah yeah.  This is William.  Yeah. Yeah. William Manyok Maluil.  Today he lives in Boston but back then he was in Kakuma as well.  And soand so you recorded this?  I recorded that yeah. It was the wedding engagement party. So there were many people from my clan and they walk in a line like in a circle and I was actually standing in the middle holding the tape player like this.  He had to hoist the recorder up into the air because he only had the built-in microphone.  And then people will go singing.  Uh-huh.  And they would just go around me.  And what were they saying? What were they singing?  So in that first part ...  Uh-huh.  ... the guy who would sing the song he would say All these beautiful color bull will not be just given to any girls. It will be given tohow do I say? Can you rewind it again?  For sure. Yeah yeah yeah. Okay here we go at the top again.   Actually it say that they will be given to a girl that have a good heart.   And then you know when we have St. Patrick's parade?  Yes.  With so many people going to South Boston?  Yes. You are at the heart of the Irish on St. Patrick's Day.  Yeah so that isthat is the same when we are getting married.   The marching will be like that. Exactly what happened in South Boston.   Okay that is amazing.   It is amazing. It is likeit is better than the written word but I do not know how to explain it really.   I mean think about this thanks to this cassette tape this spinning magnetic miracle for really the first time the Dinka were able to record their history outside of someone's head.  Before that moment it was not done.  Again Jok Madut Jok.  It was not possible to be done because people were focused on survival and access to technology was limited. So cassette tapes helped to conserve and preserve that which is the essence of people's existence which include celebrating who they are.  And I mean these recordings were not just happening or staying in Kakuma.  There were a lot of others doing it. It became like a fashion.  I mean that is how South Sudan was able to remain in contact with each other.  As the diaspora spread so did the tapes.  One tape will make it out of South Sudan and it will go to Calgary Canada. And then the people in Calgary have relatives in London so they send it to London the next time somebody's going right? To South Dakota to Nairobi Kampala. And it will take years to make rounds.  Thousands and thousands of tapes moved this way. And while in Kakuma they would been doing these recordings for a year or so when that list showed up there was still so much to capture and suddenly so little time to do it.  They say that you have seven day to say goodbye to yourto your people.  You only had seven days?  Yes. After seven days you are told to leave the camp.  And so with the fullness of their history and the wisdom it contained sort of out of their grasp they decided that what would be best was for each of them each of the boys to make one final tape or really have one final tape made for each of them.   Before they left most of these guys had a sort of a going away party.  Yes. And mine was under the tree. I had my family there and then my eight mates were there women were there. And the cassette recorder was on the top of a small table in the middle.   And one by one folks went up to the recorder and gave one final piece of advice.  Mine actually started with prayers from one of my great uncles.  This is William again. And in fact the tape you are hearing is from his goodbye ceremony.   When the prayer was finished William's oldest uncle went up to the microphone.   I am your uncle. The words being spoken to you here today on the occasion of your leaving are being said in times of ruin.   But the idea that you are leaving a bad place is a false one. We are saying 'Go to America and study so you can become an important person.'   We who you are leaving behind cannot achieve all these things. We cannot bring the people together because we cannot read or write. So son of Maluil go and do something good.   And what you hear from different speakers and on different tapes from different going-away parties is advice doing what these Dinka songs had done so well.   My name is Dhieu Malen Ajok. The family started with Garang Jok a long time ago and he produced us all who are so numerous now. Always remember where you came from. Remember that you are not going just for your sake but for all of our sakes. It is not about you alone it is about all of us who were born together.  I mean one by one these speakers are reminding these boys of their past situating them inside of it and advising them on how to move forward.  And so yeah it is We know you. You left when you were seven. You managed to make it to Kenya.  Again Maketh Bul Maboir.  Now you are taking another journey. But we just want to remind you how lucky you are to be able to get this chance. Do not mess it up. And remember whoever you left behind.   The sense of pride in all of that can be quite incredibly touching you know?  Once more Jok Madut Jok.  When the whole world thinks that these are godforsaken people because look what they have gone through look what is going on in their land look how far they have fled and yet here you find somebody not only reconstructing their history and not only lamenting the miseries thrusted upon them but talking about the need to rise up and rise above all that because that is the measure of a human. Because life happens. What are you going to do about it? You may be living a nice life in some cozy suburb in the United States but then you get cancer or you get afflicted by some terribly ungodly disease. You are just as much suffering there as if you were in a war zone.  Hmm.  What difference does it make? And whatever calamity and whatever journey that you go through with all the obstacles thrown in your path what is required is for each one of us to be conscious and cognizant of where we come from. For you will not know where you are going and how you are going tohow you are going to chart the path forward if you have no clue where you have came from.  We have got one final story for you right after a quick break.   All right we are back. I have got one final story for you. This one's about tapes made to help you move on.  There is the man of the hour Mr. David Gebel holding the door for me. You look dashing!  So several months back I traveled into Manhattan and up to midtown to visit a dear friend and colleague.  Who are you?  I am David Gebel. I work at Radiolab. I do the paperwork stuff.  I was telling Eli I was coming up here and we realized you make appearances on the show more than some producers.  Quite often!   David does a whole hell of a lot more than just the paperwork. He is sort of the beating heart of the show here.  Oh heck yeah!  And somehow the guy's managed to live like a dozen different lives. He lived in Japan for a while Hawaii. Sang Broadway tunes on cruise ships acted in television shows worked on Wall Street. And each of these livesand this is actually the reason I went up to visit himare sort of preserved under his bed in a box full of cassette tapes.  And so what we have here is a plastic big Tupperware thing withI do not know. How many cassettes are in here? There are quite a few!  I do not know. It is a bunch ofoh look at that. There is more!  There are like 40 ...  Well they are not all mixtapes but they are all things that Iokay I got rid of most of my cassettes which was all I had my music on at one point in my life. But I had to keep a couple because they were the homemade ones and they had meaning. Meaning someone created them for me.  These mixtapes really ran the gamut given to him by all sorts of folks for all sorts of reasons.  Here's one called Gebel Trauma Treatment and it was just for when I was feeling bad.  David's Musical Theater. Is this you singing?  No I think this is from my partner long ago strongly suggesting songs I ought to do.  Well and we have got some nice artwork here. We have got a naked ass.  Like a tight muscled ass where he wrote Tokyo 1989. This one is named so inappropriately that I cannot even say it on the air.  But the ones that still resonate the loudest with himmaybe unsurprisinglywere from lovers.  Vince who was my boyfriend in Tokyo he was a you know terrible boyfriend but he really could be great when he wanted to be. Tree Felling In Wonderment In Japan. It is a good title. Tree felling which makes me suspect that is the early stage of I am falling for you.  Ah!  And then Wonderment is when we are together. It was a great affair.  And so we have got a little Panasonic a Radio Shack cassette player there as well.  Yeah I used to use this for rehearsals in my showbiz days.   You can tell by the sound. This isthis is romance this is emotion. Do not make me cry that early in the interview!  I happen to be a crier you know? Not everybody is but I am. I just am.   Let us see what is next. So next should be what? Tuck  Patti? High romance.   Oh! Oh and the feeling was mutual! Oh man! If somebody sends you this I mean oh it is great.  Yeah so ...  It was good to be loved. It was really good to be loved. Yeah I mean Simon if you get something like this it is a big audio love letter. And I would put this on and miss him and drink Jack Daniels and  feel sorry for myself and be very smitten. I mean think about how much work this is. It is a lot of work. And it isit is a gift of great affection. So it just brings the emotion back. I sound like such a wuss. .  No you do not.  And while this is sort of what I was expecting you know listening to old mixtapes is sort of like going on a nostalgia bender what I was not prepared for was how these tapes some 30 years old and listened to an untold number of times how they were still evolving in their message and meaning for David. That playing them was not like staring at some static artifact but instead more like resuming an ongoing conversation between this present and that past.  Okay what is this one?  This Is Your Life David Gebel. Subtitled It is been a pretty good ride. This is from Stephen G. Halts who was my big love of my life. And we met in college and he was a native New Yorker and I was a squeaky-clean Milwaukee kid. Oh my gosh. I am afraid to put this in.  And he put the date it was made.  Sixoh that is my birthday! 6-17-196-17-86. 6-17-86. Wow! I have gotta think about that. If he died in '88 this is two years before he died. Because the truth is we broke up before he died. So you know to say the big love of my life died of AIDS there is a caveat to that because we were not a couple at the time. But we talked every single day. And it was hard for both of us because the affection was so deep up to you know the day he died. There was no doubt of our love for each other.  This might have been a We know it needs to end and maybe I would moved off on my own and this is sort of a summary of my life with him.   What did she say?   I love this song.  What is this?  This is the opening. This is Moving Out by Bette Midler. It is so funny.   Yeah Ioh gosh. I think he isthis is us breaking up yeah. Because it begins with You are Moving Out which is a great song. And then The Honeymoon Is Over. Need I say more? That is what it is about. And it is funny this isbut where did we end up? Oh ...  What is the last track?  Not When I am Around from Sweeney Todd which is aI know it is from Sweeney Todd but it iswell he is gonna look after me. He is gonna keep an eye on me. Nothing's gonna harm you notshit! I cannot talk about this! Maybe he already knew he was sick. I do not know. Well I was going off on my own because we had an apartment and the deal was whoever can find their own place first does it. So we were living together when we were broken upsomething I do not advise. But it is New York you hang on to real estate. And this is Nothing's going to harm you not when I am around. It is probably from the show. I mean it is probably from the cast album. Do you know your musical theater Simon?  No I do not.   It is a really good song. Oh.   It is more the context of it for me than the song.   That is him saying No matter what I will keep an eye out for you. It just meant we were always gonna be in touch which is why I will never throw it out. elp tape Human beings use or abuse the courage.
