 You are listening to ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR slash my closet. I am working from home as you might be as well. And in our last episode we asked you to tell us how is the coronavirus affecting your family relationships?   Hello?  Hey. We heard from a listener in Connecticut.  Good morning. This is Liying.  Liying was born in Wuhan China. She is been living in the U.S. since college. She told us about this one Saturday afternoon in the forever ago that was early February. She was out with her husband Federico. They would left the kids with her parents and they were out taking a stroll.  It was a fairly cold day.  And they were approached by some college students raising money for the Australian wildfires. That if you remember was the big news story at the time.  And then my husband stops me and he turns to the group of students takes out his wallet and hands them a 10 bill. And the boy holding the donation box - he turned to my husband and said thank you so much you know have a great day.  Ten bucks and a thank-you. Liying felt her whole body seize up in rage.  Like I could not wait to just turn away from the group of students and just start walking.   And then as they turned the corner I just lashed out at him. You know how could you do that? Or it might have been how could you do that to me? If I did not say the to me I definitely meant how could you do that to me?   Every night for the past few weeks she had been on WeChat getting updates from her family in Wuhan about a citywide lockdown death rates climbing hospitals overwhelmed. And this distance between her life here and her family's life in China made her feel terrible. She would started fundraising for medical supplies to send back to Wuhan. It struck her really for the first time on this street corner that her husband might not feel the urgency that she felt which would mean that he would somehow failed to notice her.  And I felt almost betrayed.   I am Gregory Warner. And this is ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. Today a story about two people in the same home separated by 5000 miles. We have heard a lot lately about how hard it is to convey the urgency of the coronavirus especially to those who have not been affected yet. In this story we dive deep into that yet - that time lag between when the virus hit two different nations and how those weeks played out in the lives of one couple what it taught them about their marriage about themselves and about how hard it is for all of us to measure the distance between ourselves and danger. fter this break.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. Liying and Federico met at a party her senior year of college. He was an exchange student from Italy. She liked his feline face and how he could quote The Odyssey in the original Greek. And she would always felt some pressure from extended family to marry Chinese but her parents liked Federico. He seemed open adaptable.  He learned how to use chopsticks very quickly. You know he learned to eat food that he would never tasted before and that is enough of a comfort for my parents I think.  The two got married got jobs in finance had two kids moved out to the suburbs. They shared a love of cooking and opera. Then in January Liying's normal life seemed to split. She would be in Connecticut arranging play dates while her uncle in Wuhan was making surreal choices. Like in the few hours when the government allowed him outside his house every few days should he use that time to buy food or to bring his mom her blood pressure medication?  He was offering to help pick up medicine for my grandma using the precious time that he was allowed to leave his subdivision.  Liying felt helpless and she confessed these feelings to a friend who added her to a local WeChat group of Chinese Americans from her neighborhood. They would exchange video clips from health workers in Wuhan appealing for more supplies.  Doctors and nurses saying hi my name is so-and-so and I just want to share with you the kind of environment that we are working under. We do not have enough medical supplies to keep up with the surge of patients. So that kind of rallied Chinese people abroad.  This WeChat group is just one of many grassroots groups across the United States that started buying up medical supplies in the private market and shipping them to Wuhan. And medical resellers were cluing into this trend and jacking up their prices. So late at night after the kids were in bed Liying would start scanning her phone for deals.  I was using my eBay app a lot. On the dining table sometimes just on the kitchen counter doing searches of N95 masks and trying to coordinate with the community here so that they could be on the cargo flight.   As the hours passed she would sink exhausted from the kitchen counter to the kitchen floor - the only light the one from her phone screen - with messages from her local WeChat group. They too were awake at this hour. Meanwhile her husband was upstairs in bed.  I fully support these initiatives right? But she was on calls like 2 a.m. 3 a.m trying to charter flights. And I was just wondering why do you think you have to do that?  The way he saw it his wife had a demanding job and two small kids. They needed her here.  I just did not understand why would she need to get involved personally so much?   Some nights he would resort to sending her a text from their bed to her on the kitchen floor as she made calls to suppliers.  Saying you know come to bed. You still have to work tomorrow. Sleeping late is bad for your body which is all true. But I felt it had to be done.  While the people on her WeChat group - they never asked her why she was doing this.  We would go around sharing why this is so hard for all of us how much you know it feels like the end of the world seeing so many people in such pain. And we sympathized with that. We empathized with that. And we wanted to do something.  Did you ever try to express some of these feelings to your husband? I mean not just saying the need is very great but saying that these people on this group they kind of understand why this is so important to me in a way that you may not understand yet.  I do not know if I tried hard enough. But I wished he would still feel that sense of urgency the way I do.  While her husband saw this problem in Wuhan as thousands of miles away she was thinking on the scale of time.   How many weeks until those masks would arrive? How many days before the last cargo flight from the U.S. was cut off and there would be no chance to send back supplies? Though she and her husband were occupying the same house they were measuring this crisis with two different yardsticks. But that was about to change.  Yeah actually my region was the first hit. The region of Lombardy.  He is from Lombardy. She is from Wuhan. What are the odds? Both husband and wife hail from the epicenters of the virus on their respective continents the first and hardest-hit regions.  Yeah . Yeah. Yeah. All our friends are laughing about us. Not that there is much to laugh about it but yeah.  He gets a call from his family. His father was just ordered to wear a mask to his job at the post office.  And actually my brother just graduated from medical school and he is supposed to start working at the hospital on April 1. Yeah. Yeah.  This changed the dynamic between husband and wife. There were no more late night texts from the upstairs bedroom to the kitchen floor.  Yeah no he is spending as much time as me on the phone following you know the Italian news outlets.  Now they could have a conversation and completely understand where the other was coming from.  You know little decisions. Like early on when the schools were open you know do we send our kids to school? Do we send our kids to childcare? We were able to easily agree.  Yeah I think I understood like more what she was going through.  For Federico he was not thinking oh this virus is 4000 miles away. He immediately saw it as how soon will it be here? The unit of measurement he was using flipped from miles to days. And he tried to explain to his kids why they could no longer use the playground in February weeks before anyone around them did the same.  So that is part of the loneliness or isolation feeling going through something and not having the support or even understanding from people around you right? They could not grasp - why are you doing that? I remember that my son's elementary school - they were organizing a large gathering with all the students and parents which was supposed to happen a week after or two weeks after. I would think like guys how can you be thinking about throwing large parties right under these conditions right? You are really not getting what is going on.  What makes you see a piece of news and think this can happen to people versus this can happen to me? It is a kind of cognitive leap that first she crossed and then he crossed after.  You give more importance to facts and circumstances that touch you personally - right? - as compared to something that you might feel like distant and not affecting you at all.   On some level we all know this about ourselves. We pay more attention to things that affect us personally less attention to things that seem far away. But is it possible that our brains are wired for a sense of distance that no longer applies to the world we live in? The model of the globe we have in our head is outmoded when we think of China or Italy as far away when a virus there could arrive here in days. And what if we do not have a family member abroad - a grandma or a brother - who can make it real for us? Then what do we do? Do we just sit here and wait until our minds wake up to the news that we have been hearing? Or might there be a way to short circuit our sense of distance to see things closer to the way they are actually happening? Did you push record?  Yes it is recording.  I was thinking about that question led me to someone who advises people on how to bridge a very different kind of technological distance.  My name is Dr. David Rock. I am the co-founder and CEO of the NeuroLeadership Institute.  Neuroleadership might seem like a tangent in the story but bear with me. It is going to make sense.  You learn about the brain you get very meta very quickly. Yeah.  David's specialty is how brain science intersects with workplace culture. So let us say you are working from home and you call into a meeting but your co-workers are there in the room in the conference room.  You know you are virtual on the phone and it just feels like they are not listening to you. The scary thing is A they are not listening to you probably but B what you do not know is that when you do speak your ideas are kind of written off in their brains without them even knowing it.  David calls this phenomenon distance bias.  So distance bias is the way your brain makes decisions according to how distant things are from you.  That co-worker on the phone - our brains perceive them as more distant and their intelligence is judged as lower their leadership qualities more lacking.  They are not going to be promoted as quickly and they are not going to be given as many opportunities to develop.  And so that is why you might have heard the advice if you are conferencing into a meeting use your webcam. Because the thinking is if you see someone's face on the screen they seem closer. You pay them more attention.  Your brain starts categorizing people as humans not just sounds. And you make fewer you know perceptual errors about why people are saying things.  And by the way David suggests going even further than that.  Take your peers for a walk around your house. Like show them your pets.  And OK let us say you do all of this. You fire up the webcam cue the dog the kitchen tour.  Let us get a funny background for Zoom or you know Skype whatever you are using. Let us put something hysterically funny and random behind us.  Do everything you can to prove that you are a flesh and blood human being not just pixels on a screen. Even though that distance is an illusion we cannot quite shake it.  We have had clients that have decided that when they have virtual meetings everyone is on camera individually. This was before this crisis. If everyone's on their own camera in their own space whether they are in the office or not when you have got people in different offices you have now completely leveled the playing field. And there is no distance bias anymore.  These companies have decided that the only way to hack our brains - to try to see the world accurately - is to put everyone on the screen at the same time.  You have got to take distance out of the equation.   And you know make a decision as if there was no distance.  The disconnect that Liying and Federico felt - it is playing out across the United States. More and more of us now are measuring this crisis in time counting down the days until when it might end or when it might get worse. But there are those of us who are still measuring this in miles. If you live in a rural area or in some parts of the country you could still say I do not know anyone with this disease. There are so few in my state. This is a problem far from me. When I talked to Federico about this period in his life when first his wife and then he saw something that no one around him seemed to see he keeps going back to this one phrase.  We were out of sync for a couple of weeks and now we are back in sync.  Out of sync. It is almost reassuring to think of it that way but also terrifying to think that it is just a matter of time before we are all on the same clock before this pandemic gets personal for everyone.  Now I feel more understood. I feel it is a shared worry. And I feel that we are all in it together.  His neighbors come to them for advice on lockdown living. And Liying says her WeChat group that was buying up masks to send to Wuhan is now using their connections to Chinese factories to bring that equipment to local police departments and fire stations and hospitals. But Liying unlike her husband still does feel out of sync as China gradually awakens and stores in Wuhan start to reopen. And while her grandma who is been resolute throughout saying this disease is not going to be how she departs from this world Liying is finally letting herself believe that.  Yeah I am optimistic seeing how Wuhan went through the disease. But I also have seen - around my neighborhood right now they are still climbing the mountain with no end in sight.   Her optimism is unwelcome and out of step with where she lives so she keeps quiet about how she feels. And that is still pretty lonely.   If you want to learn more about this topic of why we heed some warnings and ignore others there is a great episode of the podcast Hidden Brain. It is called The Cassandra Curse. We will have a link to that in the show notes. This episode was produced by Autumn Barnes with help from Derek Arthur Aviva DeKornfeld Jess Jiang and me. Our editor was Lu Olkowski. Help from Shankar Vedantam and Sana Krasikov.   And there goes the toilet. So we are going to wait because this is a home studio. Oh there it goes. OK. John Ellis composed our music. Isaac Rodrigues mastered the episode. Erin Register is our project manager. Neal Carruth Chris Turpin and Anya Grundmann sit upon our high council. We always love to hear from you especially now.
