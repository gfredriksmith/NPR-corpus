              I am Simon Adler. This is Mixtape. A series about how the cassette allowed us to record reshuffle and reimagine our lives. And in this case welcome in a new world order.  Yeah...  And we are starting off today with a second Simon Simon Goodwin.  So I am indeed Simon Goodwin. I have been inventing gadgets and writing computer software since the late 1970s.  These days he sports a white goatee and a like a waterfall of white hair running down the back of his head. Kind of has the vibe of a mad computer scientist.  I am afraidyeah that isyou got it. Absolutely yeah.  I have to imagine that when you were growing up in the 1970s like there were not a lot of computers around.  Actually the situation was that having a computer at home really set you out as aas a bit of nutter I would say at that point.  I mean its hard to imagine today but back then most people didnt have any experience with computers.  Yeah. People understood computers as being quite giant electronic brains...  Right.  That could not be argued with.  They were just big government-owned science machines. And so Simon could really only share his passion for these things with a small circle of oddballs like him. Which he did   On this local independent radio show he worked at...   It was a weekly magazine-style show broadcast in west-central England.    Heard by maybe I dont know maybe a couple hundred people.  We did things like which computer should I buy?   The answer to which should be one that has not been made yet. And what is the jargon mean?   And then also    Lots and lots of computer game reviews.    And well for Simon this was fun and all it seemed small.  I mean I would already been deeply deeply moved and had my life changed by these obscure computers And I knew that home computing it is not about shooting games or driving racing games it is aboutit is about sharing.   Huh. And how did you know that?  Well I used to ride my Vespa motor scooter to a pub where there was a computer club. We would bring along the software that we would written ourselves we would show people and they would usually be Can I have a copy of that? Can I have a copy of that? And you would swap.  And when you did that you were not just handing them a program ...  You would be swapping inspiration and ideas too.  And so really before most he saw the future filled with these computers.  Oh yeah. I believed they were going to change the world.  I mean way back in 1983 he was already imagining open-sourced software file sharing a world where ideas and information would be shared across borders and between people frictionlessly.  And so it was pretty obvious that we needed to do something innovative.    Obvious to me anyway.   And one day...  I had an abnormal idea.     That using nothing more than a simple cassette tape he could create the internet. Or at least an internet.   Of freely downloadable software.  To explain ...  All of the early computers certainly this side of the Atlantic even the Apples used cassettes.  Strange as this may sound before there were flash drives or floppy discs there were these data cassettes. I have actually got a couple with me right here. This is Finance 1 for 1979 Apple computers. This one's Arcade Classics for the Commodore 64. And I mean these were the exact same cassettes you would use to play music on your stereo but instead of music ...  A cassette plays two different tones a bit like Morse code.  So what I will show you now is this is the original 1982  model of the spectrum.  Sitting in his office over Zoom he actually isolated these tones and played them for me.  Here we go.  A deep note for a one and a  note an octave higher for a zero.  And so to load a program you would literally play those tones into a computer off a cassette the computer would listen to those tones flying by super-duper fast convert each of them into a zero or a one and then display whatever youre running on your screen.  Roughly speaking thats exactly right.  And so Simon thought ...  I mean the synergy with radio was obvious. Because that...   Since this software is sound we could use our little radio show to broadcast it.  And not only that I mean we were already using our cassette recorders to record hit records off the radio...  So people could tape that radio broadcast...  Onto a cassette.  Have their own copy.  And then play it into home computers.   Did anybodydid anybody you were working with say like Simon what the hell are you talking about? This is a terrible idea.  Well in those days if you would got a home computer you were regarded as mad anyway.    Okay.  So you did not get much challenging.  And so ...   One evening in December 1983 Simon wrote up a small bit of software to share with anyone who was listening.       Inside the radio station Simon and his co-host walked people through what was about to happen. Prepared them to hit record. And across the broadcast region ...    People were ready and waiting.    Well presumably quite a few people switch off. But beyond that it worked. Yeah it did.    Across the county hundreds of people had captured these mysterious tones onto a cassette played that cassette into their computers and then on their screen  First they would see the pixels arrive on the screen and then as the tones changed timbre they would see   Something that I thought looked a bit like a reindeer.    It was a little Rudolph animation.  He ishe is wagging his leg or something along those lines. Of course you could not tell his nose was red. The graphics were black and white.  Okay. And why Rudolph?  It was Christmas.  It wasokay.     Okay Simons reindeer was sort of hilariously rudimentary. But this was 1983. Before Tiktok before twitter or texting or really even emails. Simon managed to send an animation across space to hundreds of people instantaneously. I mean at that time the only way to send someone a bit of text was by letter. And the only way to share a picture or a song was by going over to someones house and handing them the actual physical photograph or cassette. And well back then yes you could record something onto a cassette tape making a copy of that tape was a technological feat beyond the grasp of all but a few people. Until that is along came a guy by the name Lord Sugar.  Yeah Lord Sugar.   Who currently is actually the host of the UK's version of The Apprentice.  He plays the sort of the boss character.  Okay. Was he knighted? And is that why he gets to call himself Lord Sugar?  Yeah because he built up an electronics industry just at exactly the time when that was the place to be.  In 1984 he released this dual deck cassette recorder.  These machines that would allow you to record from one cassette tape to another cassette tape.  This is legal academic Daniela Simone. She is an expert on UK copyright law who remembers this twin deck cassette player.  It was a truly revolutionary technology of distribution and a very fond memory of my youth.  So did you have one of these growing up?  No the people who had that at school were really just the coolest really. I wasntyou can tell having become an academic I was not one of the coolest kids.  Oh I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.   Oh probably Ive given myself away then.  But Daniela says she did go over to her friends house that did have one.  Some twins Katherine and Timothy.  Theyof course have they have the dual deck of course the twins have the twin cassette recorder.  Exactly.  And copying these tapes with her friends she says was crazily empowering.  Like magic. You know? Cus before this record companies they were able to control the way in which you would access what they were selling.  Like you couldnt make a playlist. You could not even just buy the songs wanted.  You had to buy the entire album. And so the idea that you could have your own compilation that you made and you could have songs in any order you wanted its like sort of a superpower this technology was giving you.  And this super power wielded by millions of kids in their bedrooms was beginning to threaten the music industry.    I mean there was this great degree of panic.    And I mean this panic even had Simon Goodwin nodding along.  Probably for good commercial reasons.  By this point he was making and selling cassette-based computer games.  It was a side revenue stream but the particular one that was a hit was a exploring underground game called Goldmine.  You would play as this little stick figure burrowing down into the ground ...   With a pickaxe and they would start exploring the space trying to avoid getting crushed.   Anyhow Simon had spent dozens if not hundreds of hours working on this thing. And so with all this pirating going on ...  I spent as much time on the copy protection as I did on the game.  Using a bit of computer magic he wrote a bit of code into the program that would detect if that cassette was a duplicate. And if so   It would not play.  I am hearing a slight tension though because on the one hand Simon youyou love the sharing with your compatriots but on the other hand you are trying to lock that thing down so that it cannot be used to its full extent potentially. So how did you square those two in your mind?  I was being paid.  I was being paid for the commercial software whereas for the radio program I will not ask whether you are getting paid but radio is not a way of making a living.  Touch Simon. Touch.     And this is the tension once money got involved. For people like Simon the people making stuff sharing effectively became stealing. However across the Iron Curtain   Questions like whos the pirate and whos being harmed were even harder to answer. In fact the whole situation was playing out in this fascinating almost upside down kind of way.  First of all thethe term software piracy waswas unknown back then. The pirate was only the guy with the parrot and one eye and nothing else.   This is Frank.  Frantiek. And that isthat is Frank in English.  But online he goes by a different name.  Do you prefer Sir Fuxoft or Mr. Fuxtoft? Now...  Now you have done the classic mistake. It is pronounced Fuxoft.  Fuxoft. Oh excuse me.  I have hadI have had this problem with English-speaking people for a long time.   Anyhow he says in Czechoslovakia at that time ...  The copyrights were something completely alien concept in our country.  The idea that a person could own a song or an idea and therefore insist that it not be copied like that just did not exist because  There is a maybe interesting story which illustrates this. Many of Western songs were just adapted to Czech and officially released over here with completely different lyrics.  What would be an example of a song? Can you think of a specific song or two?  Of course. So for example ...  Take My Breath Away  Berlin's Take My Breath Away here.  Stolen ...  And re-written as ...   Please Do not Laugh At Me.  Really?  Yeah. And there were literally like dozens of these songs.  Do not Cry For Me Argentina  Do not Cry For Me Argentina it was released over here as a song about   Drive carefully in your car when you are going through the mountains.     And Fuxoft was so cut off that growing up he was convinced those were the original versions.  Yes I thought those were Czech songs. I am not sure how much do you know about how socialism worked in fact. Because...  Treat me like I am a child and I know nothing.  Yeah okay.  Yeah.  So let us say you wanted something from the West. Anything like clothing computers calculators. Illegal. There was simply no legal way to get it.  So as late as 1980 he would never seen the computer.   But then I visited exhibition of achievement of Soviet republics.  Sort of like a Communist science fair.  They were showing the best that socialism has to offer. And there was a computer. It was probably some kind of stolen clone of an Apple computer.   By todays standards super simple.  There was no graphic. It was just green symbols on the black screen. And older guys than me were programming that computer. And that was like complete science fiction for me. And I was absolutely fascinated by this. And I immediately saw that this is something I wanted to do in my life.   And so Fuxoft became like an eastern bloc version of Simon Goodwin  student.  Only a little more celebrated.  I was like a wunderkind.   They were making interviews for TV and for newspapers with me. Like This boy he understands computers.    Because hed taught himself to program he became a sort of Communist Party show pony.   We were being paraded. You see? This is our future. They are playing with computers.   But while the communist party was showing him off as the best of the best he was about to realize just how far behind the curve he and everyone he really knew really was. He said he doesnt recall the specifics perfectly but signed off on my taking a few creative liberties for you. He says it happened...  I would say '84 probably. I knew a guy who could get commercial games.  He smuggled the cassettes in from Yugoslavia. And somehow Fuxoft got one of these games either from him or someone else.   Fuxoft played it into his computer. And when this scree of data was finished playing   He began to play this game from the West.  One of the first was Moon Cresta it was called.  It is one of those games where you are a spaceship moving laterally at the bottom of the screen shooting upwards at alien spaceships. Very very simple game.  But it washow to describe? It was better than anything I have seen in my life. I thought this is amazing. There were like different graphics and levels.   The action was flashier the sound effects were richer. This was not a game you just played and beat in an afternoon. You could play it for days.   And I mean it completely like changed mychanged my view of what is possible.  It opened his eyes to what was already happening on the other side of the Iron Curtain. This world that his own government had completely cut him off from. And eventually he thought I have to share this with my friends so they can experience this too.  Yes yes. Something like that. But it had a copy protection scheme.   That bit of code that Simon put into his games? This game had one of those too. And so to be able to copy and share it ....  IcI had to crack it.  Essentially pick its digital lock.  Okay this shouldnt be too hard to do myself.   Fuxoft went for it.  So basically switch on computer and type in last load. Decode loader. Inside another loading routine. Exit back to operating system.  Butdid not work.   They were really using all the tricks in the book.  So he tried again.   Write my own save routine. No place to putmemory was full.   Still did not work.      Much to the glee of folks like Simon Goodwin.  When Iwhen I would create something I would do my best to protect it. And so you do not put up something on the screen saying You are a nasty pirate!  What you do is mislead the person by reporting a tape-loading error because then they think Oh no this is a world of pain I am entering into! Who cares? Let us copy somebody else's game.  But for Fuxoft cracking this thing was its own sort of game.  I was something like a quintessential geek.   So it was a challenge to me to actually I could like look into it and find tricks which they have used.  what I had to do. At the beginning save the game as the loading started. Instead of running itoperating systems wasbright every kilobyte was needed  operational screenI was hating thisno modificationspress T for change origincannot be copiedoverwrittenthen exit.   I do not think I am ever gonna fully understand what you just said.   Yeah.  Which I think is okay. I thinkI think I can like say a cartoonish version of it thatthat communicates the idea but I will not understand it. However what I do need to understand is did it work or not?  Well in that case yes!  HALLELUJAH!   I cracked it and the game ran. And from that point on it could be copied throughout the whole country. JAROSLAV  Very very fast.  That is Jaroslav velich.  JAROSLAV  Professor at Charles University in Prague.  He wrote a whole book in these pirated games. And he said JAROSLAV  Just by people kind of giving it to each other.  This thing multiplied and spread internet style almost as fast as that Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer broadcast.  JAROSLAV  It took about six days to spread across the whole country. And there wasthere is a term for it. It is called Sneakernet. Like just people in sneakers running around and distributing cassette tapes.  We had so-called copy parties. Like dozens of people were meeting. All of them brought their small computers put it on the tables and connected their tape decks to the one device.  And through this rat's nest of cables ...  They were doing copy to all of them at the same time.  Somebody would then leave that copy party ... JAROSLAV  Running around the neighborhood with a plastic bag full of cassette tapes.  He gave it probably to some of his friends.  They took their copies to copy parties   And each of the copies from the originals created five or ten more copies.  And those would then be copied. And so on and so on.  And so on.   It was the loaves and the fishes. Suddenly you could feed all of the people you wanted   Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Exactly. Exactly. So basically for people around me I was something like a god.  This of course set off its own cold war-style arms race with folks like Simon creating new copy protections and folks like Fuxoft figuring out how to break them.  Well and so over the course of your career how many games do you think you cracked?  I would say between 100 and 200.   Wow.  Actually how do you call it in English? I was looking forward to when there was a new copy protection method.  Why?  Because I learned so much just from debugging their copy protection schemes.  Strangely this arms race became its own form of sharing.  So I got a great respect for the people who came up with those copy protection schemes.   And Simon says he began to feel the same way  It became a collaborative and creative process of hmm forward and backward communication.  Each time he updated his copy protections it became less an angry attempt to deny robbers. And more like Huh. Okay Lets see what you can do with this.  Yeah so what we were doing there was partly we were sharing knowledge and partly we were trying to show one another what was possible.   And not just what was possible with zeros and ones or bits and bytes. I mean by the late 1980s more and more pirated material of all types was being smuggled in and shared on these cassettes. And so folks who had always thought Dont Cry for Me Argentina was about driving in the mountains were suddenly and simultaneously experiencing this onslaught of slapstick explosive stupid dynamic compelling media that capitalism is so good at pumping out. And when I talked to Fuxoft he told me that he he thinks this media and the sharing that facilitated it was at least one of the reasons why...     So many people all at the same time were primed to want more and ready to take to the streets to get it.   Definitely through pirated movies and music and computer games more and more people including me could see how better it is for you to live in a capitalist society.   It just came down because ofbecause of this. Because it was no longer tenable.  Resign! Resign! They demanded.  And I think that is why basically the communism ended basically at the same timesame time the whole Europe.      And after the Iron Curtain did fall ...   Someone paid me to come up with pr copy protection scheme for his game.    Fuxoft took full advantage of his newfound freedoms.  Oh what a good little capitalist you became!  I know. Did I tell you about bitcoins? About me and bitcoins?  No no no. Tell me tell me.  Well like later I started blogging about movies.  Okay.  And I allowed people to send me like voluntary amount of money. Just if you want send me money.  Like an early Patreon thing or something?  Yeah yeah. Basically. And 11 years ago I said Okay here is this thing this bitcoin. Here is how it works. It is very interesting. You can also send me bitcoins if you want to. Well okay. Andand then they sent me something over 200 bitcoins.  200 bitcoin. Let me look this up.  Yep.  Okay into US dollars.  10 million.  And now I do not have 200 of them but I can tell you I in the last year I bought a newnew car and a new house with bitcoins.      Turns out Simon Goodwin is right radio is just not the way to make a living.   Now whether or not Fuxoft is right that these Sneakernets and cassettes helped bring down the Iron Curtain is sort of impossible to tell. However up next weve got the story of a cassette internet that without a doubt sparked a revolution.   Thats after a quick break.       In politics you can say something and thousands of people or maybe millions of people pay attention because it relates to their destiny. And so all politician have a strong motivation to be a god to have the destiny of the people in their hands.  Alright were back. I am Simon Adler. This is Mixtape. And for part two sort of a B side here Ive got the story of how one man's voice upended a country's politics and continues to echo around the globe today.   Starts off with the guy you just heard Mohsen Sazegara.  I was born in Tehran in 1955.  He was a precocious kid bookworm loved reading about political theory and political philosophy.  I did not know maybe you call it geek or something.  I tried very hard during all my education years.  He left Iran moved to Chicago in the mid-70s to study physics. But by 1978 his focus was very much back home...  Making a revolution.    At that time Iran had already been engulfed in the years-long struggle against the country's tyrannical leader.   The Shah.  Shah came to power with a British and American plot and he was a military dictator.   He and his secret police SAVAK ran the country with an iron fist and impunity.  The you know shadow of SAVAK was everywhere.  And Mohsen and all sorts of other folks wanted this guy out. I mean there were nationalists fighting against the Shah Marxists and leftists like Mohsen. And while theyd made some strides.   Getting people out onto the street to protest things were stagnating.  Yes without that we have a long battle.  And so Mohsen and his smarty pants leftist allies decided to hit reset which is where our story really begins here.   We went to a small village 45 minutes out of Paris.  This town Neauphle-le-Chteau would be their new base of operations in France. They knew someone there who owned this rudimentary house they could stay in.  I remember there was one shower which had no hot water in the cold weather of France.   And they were bunking up with this relatively unknown and very unlikely ally. This long bearded cleric the Ayatollah Khomeini.   Khomeini was quite old. He would been in exile for quite some time.  That is Kim Ghattas.  Longtime journalist who is covered the Middle East and the United States.  And she says Mohsens allies had hand-picked Khomeini to join them.  We needed a religious leader that was activists against the Shah.  Someone who could really inspire people to take to the streets. And Khomeini fit that bill.  Yes he was very adamant. He was kind of crazy. He was the kind of guy who would not compromise.   He said the Shah should get the hell out of Iran.   This is Iranian writer and activist Arash Azizi.  He said you know he said  means Shah has to go.  And so Mohsen and the other leftists...  because all of us were well educated in best universities of Western countries.  Thought they could use Khomeini overthrow the Shah and then cast Khomeini aside.  Yeah.  And so from this tiny town these strange bedfellows hatched a plan to make Khomeini a superstar.   Mohsen and the leftists with their connections  They would set up literally a media office.  Made a bunch of calls. Sent out tons of press releases.   And before long    Neauphle-le-Chateau became the center of the media universe.   France  And with the cameras trained on him...   BecauseAnd this is where things get complicated sitting on the floor or out under an apple tree Khomeini would let the reporter ask their questions...   And hed then answer those questions   In Farsi.   Which the reporters didnt speak.   So the leftists like Mohsen...   Would step into translate. And what they said what they translated something soft smart and diplomatic...   Was often quite different from what Khomeini had actually just said.  Khomeini believed in what he called velyat-e faqh. How do I translsorry let me just check how I translate that.  Mm-hmm.  A state a velyat-e of the faqh of the wise man. So you know an Islamic State on Earth.  Yeah. He thought that if you implement a religious order from Middle Ages everything will be right and we will have a utopia on the Earth.  So it waslike was that a red flag for you in any ways?  No. You know why? Because we were in danger by Secret Service of Shah SAVAK. We were imprisoned by Shah. And we were ready to sacrifice ourour life. So our first priority was to bring down regime of Shah. And without thatKhomeini was in our side.   And again they also thought Khomeini was a useful puppet theyd eventually discard. They were in control. And so anytime he brought up this idea of this Islamic State...   They would omit that as they called it crazy talk. So that part of the message did not reach the Western media.  But the problem was basically no part of the message was reaching the people of Iran.   The Shah of Iran had an iron grip on media and media would have been the radio and TV and the newspapers.  Again Arash Azizi who says the Shah had this media blockade that was effectively preventing all of this news coverage all of this messaging from making it back into Iran to its target audience.  And there was not of course any WhatsApp or any internet services.  So they needed to find some underground analog way in. Enter the cassette tape.   Every week at weekends after evening praying...  Oftentimes sitting in this blue and white striped tent they would erected in the backyard.  Ayatollah Khomeini he had this speech about sometimes an hour or less than an hour.   And this is where theyd let Khomeini be Khomeini.   And we recorded them to cassette tapes.   Shah you are not a king. You are a nasty rebellious person. You are ruling the country against the rule of law. People want a politician or ruler whose beliefs are based on Islam.   Islam is the religion that half a century ago conquered all countries in the region to make them decent human beings. Islam is not dictatorship. It is God's rule.   When Khomeini had finished his speech and the recording was done  After his speech I took that cassette to the basement  Recorded a little intro onto it.   The speech of the Great Leader...   Then the date.  And then one day Mohsen or one of his allies thought maybe theres a way to send these cassettes these back to Iran.  Maybe by telephone.   In that house we had an international line and a colleague in Iran who was an engineer in telecom of Iran. And he and his friends they could open international line one international line from Iran for us like a collect call.  And while these speeches were going to be less diplomatic less polished than the messages Mohsen had been passing to the western press  They did not mind whether the Iranians who were religious heard this message about an Islamic State because they thought okay it would bring them out onto the streetand it is never gonna happen anyway! So let him say whatever he wants because it is all crazy talk.   I remembered the first time...  After one of Khomeini's weekend speeches  I took the cassette up the stairs to our colleagues. And I remembered that they smoked cigarette cigarettes very much.  And thethe room was always covered by smoke. Gave it to them. And then our friend in telecom connected the line. And...  With the revolutionaries in France now speaking to the revolutionaries in Iran they attached this tape player to the phone and pressed play.   And our colleagues in Iran...  Using a little tape player on their end....   Recorded it.  When the call was finished folks in Iran they took the tape out rewound it played it back.   You could just imagine the crackly quality that you would get.   And it worked.   Suddenly Khomeini was there with them in that room.   With their proof of concept they started going wild with this.  Yeah yeah.  Once a week from France they would set up a conference call.  So there could be many phones calling at the same time.  All the folks on the call would record it.   Answering machines were being used.  From the various points in Iran then they would start making calls spreading it further. And along each step of the way  This network of people  You know have almost a little cottage industry duplicating the tapes.  They duplicated it thousands...  And thousands and thousands of times.  It becomes a flood.   So yes it is estimated that it took about nine hours from a speech being given by Khomeini to it being spread in large numbers of tapes in Iran.  I mean these things were spreading hand to hand from family member to friend in the bizarre in living rooms. I mean at its peak some 90000 mosques were duplicating and distributing these tapes.  Well it feels to me like this is a Khomeini seeing how to create virality before virality was a word outside of epidemiology.  Absolutely. Absolutely. Khomeini knew exactly what it meant. Thatthe art of Khomeini was he exactly knew what to say to go viral.  What to say. And just as importantly how to say it.  Great politicians in the world the most of them can speak very well and have very good lectures. But Ayatollah Khomeini was not like that. His grammar is one of the worst. Maybe I gave him a D or F.  He used the verbs in the wrong way. He had quite a provincial accent.  This is Nazila Fathi.  Former New York Times correspondent based in Tehran for 17 years.  She also grew up in Iran as all this was happening. And she says his language was so strange that educated folks made fun of him.  They wouldone of the jokes was that Yogurt is white. Yogurt is white. Three words. Because all his sentences were like that very simple. And obvious things!  But while the upper crust was mocking him  His speech was more attractive for ordinary people.    He was from rural Iran so were many many Iranians millions of Iranians. Even the ones who had grown up in the cities their parents came from villages. So this was a very familiar language to them similar to the language of their fathers or grandfathers.  And on top of all this was the way people were hearing it.   People had cassette players at home so you could listen to it at home and you could sort of gather round  And altogether listen to those cassettes.  And when they did that when they sat down and pressed play   It is not a politician speaking to a reporter. It is not a politician behind a lectern giving a stump speech. It is not even some image being beamed into your television and your neighbor's television and their neighbor's television.   It is a man in your living room speaking to you and saying that there is important work to be done and that you are invited to be a part of it. That youve been treated unfairly. That you have been wronged. But but with your help we can fix it. We can make the world a better place. We can make the world as great as it used to be. And that the only thing standing in our way is one man.  So his voice gave them an identity purpose. This voice that they could keep hearing and it would drill in over and over and over again.  One Iranian man we spoke to who heard these tapes said in hindsight that it was almost like Khomeini had hypnotized him. And he was not unique.  Every everybody in Iran in every faction listened to Ayatollah.  Millions of people. I mean when Khomeini called for strikes on these tapes they happened. When he told people to take to the streets on these tapes it happened. And when he told the Shah to get the hell out of Iran that eventually happened as well.     It was through these cassette tapes that Khomeini mobilized the masses and managed to hijack the revolution from all the other political parties.    January 16 1979 the Shah fled Iran. And he would be replaced by and what Khomeinis victory would mean for Iran began to come into focus just two weeks later as Khomeini was flying from France back to Iran.  When they were on their way back to Tehran on the Air France plane that had been charted for them.  Again journalist Kim Ghattas.  As the plane entered the Iranian airspace Peter Jennings of ABC of course managed to get up to Khomeini and ask a question.    And he asked him   And the Ayatollah listens to the translation of the question into Persian and the answer is....   Hichi. Nothing.  And the translator as always one of these leftist intellectual types.  He cant believe what hes just heard so he asks the Ayatollah Hichi?    Khomeini repeats and I am reading sort of phonetically Hichi ehasi nadaram. I do not feel a thing.   Now what he meant by nothing none of us will ever know for sure. But listening to that interactionand this is something Kim Ghattas felt tooyou do get the clear sense of a man who sees himself as simply taking his next predestined step into power. A man who sees himself as apart from and above the trifling emotions of politics and men.  Here's a man who has been in exile for 15 years and he is about to touch down his home country and he feels nothing?  And his translator almost didnt seem to know what to do with those words.  He tells Peter Jennings...   He does not make any comment.       That moment on the plane is when you start seeing the danger of what Khomeini actually represents. But it was too late. I think it was too late.    And to this day the Islamic government is ruling Iran.        I guess I wonder Mohsen your voice on these tapes? How do you feel knowing that your voice is in some ways forever intimately tied to Khomeini's voice?  Mmm? Not so guilty I have to say.  Okay.  Because now that I look back we know that the combining revolutionary ideology with religion is the wrong way. But in those days Inobody knew that. Not only me as a 23-years-old student but none of the thinkers. Even the Western thinkers. So I do not thinkI was a part of a big movement in Iran by the people of Iran.  Like as I have been preparing to talk to you the person that you remind me of is like the sales rep for Purdue Pharma who was going out and pushing OxyContin. Like you did not know how dangerous this thing was that you were pushing on people.  Yeah.  But you are doing it. Have you had to grapple with that fact?  Iyeah. II can say that unfortunately I did not think about the future. The system that he suggests we thought that we can make an utopia on the Earth. We were wrong. I can say now that all those thoughts were wrong.   We got one more thing for you. Its actually a secret message that you can decode. Well have that for you right after one more quick break.  After these messages well be right back.    Alright Im Simon Adler. This is Mixtape. Before I let you go today Simon Goodwin the mad computer scientist from our first story today he went to the trouble of coding a little secret message for you. Its a secret message that he turned into zeros and ones and then high tones and low tones that were going to play for you right here and right now. And so if you have an old ZX Spectrum computer or you want to go dig up an emulator online you can take this sound that were about to play put it onto a cassette and load the message. And in fact if youre listening to this on the radio you can go further. You could actually record this straight off the radio onto a tape and run it into a ZX Spectrum just like Simon Goodwin did back in 1983. Okay anyhow. Im going to give you a moment to prepare yourselves. If youre gonna tape this you know put the tape in. Get ready to hit record. Because here it goes. Three two one.   Alright there it is. If you get this to work please let me know. I would love to hear about it. Shoot us an email or tweet at us. Yeah Im just super curious to know if this functioned at all.
