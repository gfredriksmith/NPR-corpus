     This is Radiolab. I am Jad Abumrad. A couple months ago the More Perfect team and I released a doc called The Gun Show which was sort of an off-angle look at the history that underlies how we talk about guns in this country. It landed right after the mass shooting in Vegas. Unfortunately here we are again. We noticed that a lot of More Perfect listeners were sharing this doc in the wake of what happened in Florida. So we thought we would share it with Radiolab listeners who have not heard it yet. It is reported by a guy named Sean Rameswaram. At the time Sean was a producer at More Perfect. He is since gone on to start a daily podcast at Vox called Today Explained. I encourage you to check out that show. Sean is amazing. In the meantime here's The Gun Show.   I think we should start with one of the most confusing sentences in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   Not We the people.   Not that one. No I got a different one. A well-regulated militia comma being necessary to the security of a free state comma the right of the people to keep and bear arms comma shall not be infringed.   Say it one more time. Say -- I am sorry.   Okay. From the top.   And do it -- do it with the commas again.   Sure. A well-regulated militia comma being necessary to the security of a free state comma the right of the people to keep and bear arms totally unnecessary comma shall not be infringed.   Is that the one that is about guns?   Adam Winkler who wrote the book on the Second Amendment. And that book is called Gunfight.   He is a journalist?   He is a professor of law ...   At UCLA.   He said ...   It is almost as if James Madison the author of the amendment had just discovered this wonderful new thing the comma and wanted to put it in there as many times as possible.   Which is like a nerdy professorial joke. But like seriously what is it? And like it had to be this one? Could not it have been the amendment about like quartering soldiers in your house that was really confusing?   Yeah.   No it is the one about guns that they made like just indecipherable.   And ever since generations of Americans have been confused by the language of the Second Amendment.   So when this thing was written we had just fought this war with the British this Revolutionary War. And they tried to win it right from the get-go by coming for our guns. So these new states are looking at this new federal government they are going like Meh we do not know if we want to trust you quite yet. So there is this second amendment that says You guys can fight back.   Like the feds are not gonna disarm you. You can -- your militias can keep your guns.   That is I think what we agree on. But then after that you just look at the sentence then it is not just the commas that are confusing. If you look at the sentence as a whole ...   The pieces do not seem to fit together.   There is some noun confusion. I mean it is obvious that the sentence is about someone's right to bear arms but who? Who gets that right? At the beginning of the sentence you get ...   A well-regulated militia.   The militia. States have a right to form militias to assemble groups of people. And those people got to have their guns. That is easy enough. But then later in the sentence there is ...   Comma the right of the people to keep and bear arms comma shall not be infringed.   The people. Which people? Those people over there in the militia? All people? If you mean all people why did you say militia? It is like the first clause seems to point to some sort of collective right to bear arms and the second clause seems to point to some individual right to bear arms.   Like this is supposed to be a popularly ratified document. It is actually not that easy to read. It is really not that easy to read. And it is not -- it was not that easy to read then.   This is Jill Lepore.   A staff writer at the New Yorker Magazine.   She is also a professor of American History.   I study the 18th century. I am really trained as a 17th- and 18th-century American political historian.   And Jill says from the beginning when people thought about the Second Amendment they tended to just focus on the first part.   That the primary motivation for the amendment is about militias.   A well-regulated militia.   That this confusing sentence was widely read as this collective militia right not an individual one.   And this truth that the Second Amendment in fact guarantees the right of an individual to bear arms and that the government federal government ...   Cannot limit that.   In any fashion.   Jill says that just did not exist.   It was not a thing.   I disagree with the way you have characterized that although what you said is stated in the media frequently.   This is Stephen Halbrook. He is represented the NRA in several cases.   I have written several books on Second Amendment issues.   He actually thinks A the sentence is just fine as is.   I do not think it is complicated at all.   B the framers were thinking about an individual right to bear arms.   The Second Amendment refers to the right of the people to keep and bear arms. First Amendment refers to the right of the people peaceably to assemble. I mean who is that? It is individuals. They are not some kind of collective that does not exist in reality.   So which -- which was it?   That is -- that is a really good question Jad. I mean it is a complicated one too. What I can tell you is that you know people I spoke to for the story said at least in the 20th century when the -- when the Second Amendment was taught in law schools it was taught as this -- it was taught as this sort of antiquated outdated thing that had to do with militias not so much individual rights. But Jill Lepore Stephen Halbrook and their respective sides something they can both agree on is that this super-sacred Second Amendment this third rail of our American politics today that just was not a thing. It was not like that.   It was utterly ignored.   People ignored this amendment.   When I was an undergraduate undergrad at Florida State University I went to the Florida Supreme Court and started looking up law review articles on constitutional law issues. And I found that there was hardly anything written about the Second Amendment.   No one ever wrote about it. Except for the third amendment there was no amendment that was less written about less legislated less debated less a subject of Supreme Court conversation than the Second Amendment.   Do not get me wrong. This is not to say people did not think about guns. People had guns states regulated guns. But for most of our history the Second Amendment it was like -- it was like sort of the runt of the Bill of Rights litter. Like no one argued about it.   It is a striking thing to think about.   There was no fight. No fight.   How surprising that is given its centrality to our political conversation today. What a extraordinary transformation.   Because there was this window of time where all of this changes the script just flips. There is 200 years of everything being chill and then suddenly you get this.     So basically in just a flash the Second Amendment goes from being ignored to being ...     Explosive to being radioactive. And in the process we start to read the thing totally differently. All of a sudden it is this hotly debated thing that is got nothing to do with that first part and everything to do with the second part.     Everything to do with my personal right. And me.     And what I want to know is how did that happen? How did we start reading the Second Amendment the way we do now? And what I found out is that in the modern history of the gun rights movement and -- and how we read the Second Amendment can be boiled down to these three totally unrelated disjointed-seeming revolutionary events.     One an invasion in Sacramento.   Then I will be damned. Let me -- what in the hell ...   Two a revolt in Cincinnati.   ... credential do you have to tell me I am wrong?   And finally ...   Bam!   Number three a reckoning at the Supreme Court of the United States.   Unbelievable. What is that sound? Can you imagine that?   So you are gonna tell me the story in three chapters?   Yeah.     Chapter 1. The Invasion.   I am a carpenter. I am a builder. I am a stand-up comedian. Jazz drummer. Structure repairman of high-performance aircraft. I did electromagnetic field blacklight non-destruct testing for the Gemini missile program and I am an expert shot with guns. I was an expert shot with guns when I was 12 years old. I was raised a hunter and a fisherman besides being a carpenter and a builder. When I am 12 years old my father buys me a high-powered rifle. Hollow-tip ammo. I can knock an elephant down with that shit. You see what I am getting at?   Can I get you to tell me -- we got to start at some point. Can I have you tell me just your name and who -- where we are and who you are? Is that cool? Can we do that first?    Is that cool?   I know it seems pretty obvious.   My name is Bobby Seale. I created the Black Panther Party. I am the founding chairman and National Organizer of the Black Panther Party.   And where are we standing right now?   We are in Oakland California.   The Black Panthers?   Yeah. So this transition from the militia to the individual my right to bear arms you could argue that that whole individual gun rights movement started in the 1960s with the Black Panthers in Oakland.   It is an unlikely and kind of surprising origin for what is known as the individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment.   We were a different breed here. I mean we some well-read guys we knew our shit. We knew our history.   Just to give some context. This is 1966. It is been an exceptionally bad time for race relations all over the country.     Protesters are being beaten at sit-ins. There is attack dogs and hoses. And in particular ...     There was major tension between the Black community and the police.     In the late '60s there were several high-profile incidents of officers shooting unarmed black men.   This is what was happening you know? And what we did is that yeah we took a position.   October 1966 Bobby Seale and his friend Huey P Newton they start this organization called the Black Panthers.   Black Panther Party for Self-Defense.   Now Huey Bobby's co-founder ...   Huey was two years in law school.   He was going to the University of San Francisco's School of Law and one day he is sitting there as you do in law school thinking about the law thinking about Malcolm X thinking about what he can do in Oakland. And it hits him.     That they could argue that the Second Amendment gave them a right to have a gun.   He said that is our constitutional democratic civil human right.   And no one had ever said that before?   Well there is always been those who claim that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to bear arms.   But Adam Winkler says people who argued that were in the minority. They were not taken too seriously. This was one of the first times that the individual rights reading was forced into the mainstream because coming out of law school class Huey tells Bobby if we have a right to bear arms we individuals?   Then we can patrol the police observe the police. Telling me -- I says You talking about patrolling the police? What legal -- you in law school so what legal status do we have?   Huey pointed to that second half of the Second Amendment.   The right of the people to bear arms. To possess and bear arms okay?   He also pointed to a California state law that said you could carry a gun as long as it was not concealed.   If the gun is not concealed it is not illegal. So ...   The Black Panthers started policing the police.   And we did.   They would go out in armed patrols and follow police cars.   On 7th Street.   Bobby told me about the first time they did it.   In West Oakland California a nightlife district.   He says it was a weekend night a police officer had pulled over some guy. And they started watching from down the street and a crowd starts to gather.   And is Huey holding a gun?   Yes he is holding a shotgun.   What kind of gun is it?   It is a shotgun. A shotgun that I bought him. That gun you see in his hand it is a high-standard gun. It cost 89 or 79. I bought the damn gun. I says Here Huey. You got your shotgun now.   So you got this white cop on one side of the street.   Arresting somebody.   And on the other side of the street you got a dozen black guys holding shotguns.   Strictly for observation. We was standing in a line. I had everybody standing in a line.   He told me the moment the cop noticed. He immediately stopped what he was doing with the guy he had pulled over and walked over to them and said ...   You have no right to observe me! And Huey says No California State Supreme Court ruling states that every citizen has the right to stand and observe a police officer carrying out their duty as long as they stand a reasonable distance away. A reasonable distance constitutes eight to ten feet. I am standing approximately 20 feet from you and I will observe you whether you like it or not. He said Man what kind of Negroes are these? Let me see that gun. No. You cannot touch my weapon. The cop says Are you a Marxist? And Huey said Are you a fascist? Are you a Marxist? Are you a fascist? Then the cop said Well I asked you first. And Huey saying I asked you second. Are you a fascist? So I mean it is like a standoff.   And this is where the dominoes start to fall. The standoff resolved themselves peacefully but the cops in Oakland are not happy. And they -- they immediately start running this up the chain.   Next thing we know ...       Mulford State Assemblyman Mulford who represented Oakland is trying to put a bill in to stop the Black Panthers.     So this bill the Mulford Act is up for debate at the California state capitol in Sacramento. And Bobby Seale decides the Panthers should be there for the debate and that they should take their guns.   I took a delegation an armed delegation to the California State Legislature May 2nd 1967. I had six women and 24 males.   And how many guns?   23 guns.   And were they loaded?   Yes.   So they roll up to the assembly in Sacramento. And guess who happens to be waiting for them right there on the front lawn of the assembly?   What are we talking what year are we talking now?   Guess who is governor?   I do not know. Who was the governor?   Guy by the name of ...       I went up there. When we got there Ronald Reagan happened to be on the front lawn.   Reagan?   Reagan.   I did not know he was going to be there on the front lawn.   That is insane!   And he was on the front lawn talking to 200 Future Leaders of America.   Kids?   Kids.   So you got Ronald Reagan.   He is 50-60 feet from us.   And a bunch of white kids.   10 11 12.   Hanging out on the front lawn of the -- of the State Building in Sacramento. And this is the 1960s. This would be insane now.   But some of the kids saw us with our shotguns on our shoulders.   And he says some of the kids ...   Come running over where we are. They thought we were a gun club of some kind. And then the press followed.   So Reagan's like What is going on? The press is like What is going on? And Bobby Seale ...   I says I am gonna read a statement.     And that is when I read the statement.     Et cetera.   And he says while he was reading that ...   Uniformed Capitol guards come running out ...   Grab Ronald Reagan ...   Took him in the opposite direction from us away from the kids okay? And so we decided to go inside because the assembly was in session at the time. Next thing I know we are all loading on three elevators. Here is shotgun rifles pointing up cameras in the -- and it is crowded. Body-touching-body crowded.   And when they got off the elevator he asked someone which way to the spectator section so the Panthers could watch the legislature debate the bill.   Somebody says This way to the right. And so I walk into this door. And as I walk into the door the president pro tempore in the State Assembly -- we are on the actual floor of the Senate. This is not the goddamn spectator section. I said Come on. Get the hell out of here man. We in the wrong goddamn place.   Wait. they walked into the state capitol with -- with shotguns?   Yeah.     And then all hell breaks loose.     I turn around and I see State assemblymen white State assemblymen ducking down behind their desks.       You can point to this forgotten unknown moment here in the State Building in Sacramento as like the game changer for the conversation about guns in America. Because suddenly overnight ...   We were on the front pages of newspapers around the world. We were a ragtag organization with this profound international notoriety.   But in being introduced to the world you had a lot of people going Wait what? Like there is a bunch of Black men rolling around with guns?   Walking into the Capitol Building?   When there is kids around?   What came of that -- that protest?   By the end of that month the Mulford Act passed. The law said no one could carry a loaded weapon inside city limits within 150 feet of public property.   This was directed at the Black Panthers?   We know it was.   Now people have all kinds of opinions about the Black Panthers and what they did particularly after Huey Newton ...   The shooting happened at 5 am.   ... later that same year was arrested for shooting and killing a cop.     The case was eventually dismissed but what seems clear is that the Black Panthers decision to use the Second Amendment to arm themselves to show up armed at the state capitol in California ...   Inspired vigorous backlash.     Americans thought a revolution was about to break out right here at home. This led to a whole new wave of gun control laws.   In California but also federal gun control.   Many of which seemed to be targeted towards African Americans rather than just reducing gun violence.   Suddenly America was like We have got to get guns off the streets.   But the irony was that even though those laws were designed to disarm left-leaning Black radicals many white rural conservatives thought that they were next. That government was going to take their guns next.   Every action creates a reaction. And at the same time that this Panthers thing is hitting front pages of newspapers around the world you have got assassinations you have got race riots you have got Vietnam protests. All of a sudden everyone's clamoring for gun control. Democrats and Republicans. In fact ...     Reagan?   Reagan. That was the exact same day as the Black Panthers showed up at the state capitol in Sacramento with their shotguns.   So Reagan. Reagan was into gun control.   Reagan's got his fingerprints all over this thing. What is happening here is the Black Panthers show up in the capital Sacramento and Ronald Reagan react. They create some gun control. Then there is even more gun control even federal gun control. And a lot of people are sitting at home watching this and they start to get very upset. Which brings us to ...   Chapter 2. The Revolt.   And I am sitting there going You know we cannot allow this to happen.   No. No.   I can buy the damn pistol that I want to buy.   These two guys John Aquilino.   I live in Rockport Texas.   Joseph Tyro.   Buffalo New York.   They get us there. And they have both been into guns pretty much their entire lives.   My father was a veteran of World War One. Did some recreational shooting with my mother.   I used to love to go to the amusement park and spend all day shooting the .22s at little things that moved in the shooting gallery.   But neither one of them was particularly hard core about their gun beliefs until around the time the Black Panthers came along.   You mean the fact that here are bunch of people who were slightly darker complected than New England Ivy League grads running around with firearms? Did that scare people? Hell yes!   Did it scare you?   No it did not scare me.   John told me Joe as well that it was not the Panthers themselves that were the problem.   I do not like anybody that tells me I cannot do something.   It was all the gun control laws that came in the wake of the Panthers.   When the Gun Control Act was passed in 1968 ...     A lot of things disappeared that I had been used to.   Joe says he starts to see gun shops in his neighborhood close. Like the furniture store in Buffalo that used to have ...   A shotgun for 5.   They stop selling them. And he says that just really bothered him because the reason you have a gun is for protection.   Yeah.   It is like another form of insurance.   Which was not an abstract idea for him. Buffalo in the '60s and '70s not the safest place in the world. His house was even broken into.   I could only describe it as a home invasion. I mean these guys actually battered their way through two doors.   Joe says he and his wife and his dog huddled in one room with a gun while these two guys stormed through his house and robbed him.   I think they grabbed my wife's purse maybe some other money and they left. I mean by the time the police got there they were gone.   Joe's whole relationship with firearms is sort of predicated upon that -- this idea that it is for self-defense. And here he is got people breaking into his house. He is got the cops not being there for him. He is got the government trying to take his gun away. So what do you do? You join the NRA.   Then I joined to fight this gun control stuff.   But this came at a moment where the NRA was at this crossroads unlike any it had seen before or since. Back when Joe joined in the early '70s ...   The NRA was not the die-hard supporter of gun rights that we know today.   Because according to Adam Winkler it was never meant to be.   The idea behind the NRA ...     Was to increase civilian marksmanship training so that the next time there is a war Americans would be capable of fighting it.   And you know you do not hear much about the NRA's founders ...   But the NRA was formed in the 1870s right after the Civil War by a reporter for the New York Times who thought that the Union soldiers had been so ineffective in the Civil War because they were not familiar with firearms.   Really?   Yeah for like a hundred years their main focus was like teaching Boy Scouts how to shoot straight.   Not the Second Amendment.   And apparently ...   If you go back through issues of American Rifleman in the '40s and '50s ...   It is like the NRA's version of Playboy. Guns instead of girls.   You will be amazed that you cannot find a single mention of the Second Amendment anywhere in those magazines.   The NRA at that point was sort of like a gun trade group. They were not super political and -- and the people who ran it ...   They were hunters. Gentlemen hunters.   They were just like these wealthy businessmen who like to hunt according to Joe.   Rich guys who you know they were hobbyists.   But you had all these people coming in like Joe and like John ...   Who were convinced that guns were not about shooting ducks. They were about ...   Self-defense.   Protecting yourself against criminals in a time of starkly rising crime rates.   And this would lead to this straight-up head-on collision at the NRA. Now right when Joe and John joined the NRA the organization had just for the first time sort of set up this lobbying arm.   Yeah. It was the brand new Institute for Legislative Action.   John actually got hired to work there in 1976.   And the Institute for Legislative Action was supposed to fight for gun rights on Capitol Hill.   That is what they both wanted it to do.   But let us put it this way. We were the if you would the bastard stepchildren of the National Rifle Association.   Really?   Yeah. When the Institute for Legislative Action was formed ...   In 1975.   The NRA refused the Institute any office space in the building.   In the mid-'70s the part of the NRA that lobbied politicians had to rent office space from the hotel next door to the NRA.   I mean it was crazy. And then ...   Right after he was hired ...   78 people fired. Very interestingly.   There was a big firing and then there was word that the NRA wanted to move leave Washington DC.   Sell the headquarters there.   And move to Colorado Springs.   What is in Colorado Springs?   Well the Olympic Camp. They were gonna move the headquarters and put it near this -- the Olympic sports training group so that they could then start writing all the magazines about all the Olympic sports.   They really did not know what the hell they were doing.   They wanted to turn the NRA from an organization of firearms owners to a publishing company.   They wanted to get out of the politics business.   The older guard did not seem to have the stomach for whatever gunfight some members wanted to have.   They were very moderate.   They thought like Maybe we should try and kind of get out of this whole gun business thing.   Well hey not just kind of getting out.   John says there was even a moment when a report surface that suggested ...   That we should change the name of the association.   Really?   Yeah. They were gonna take 'Rifle' out.   Tell me more. Tell me everything.   There would be no NRA.   Do you remember what any of those proposed names were?   No.   But they were considering at least taking rifle out.   Oh yeah.   Huh.   Yeah. And it -- it bridled. I mean ...   I was just so pissed off. And that is when the seeds of revolt were planted.   A few months later ...     This is from one of those meetings.   Cincinnati Ohio. 1977.   The annual NRA meeting of members.   I think it was May but I am not sure.   May 22nd.   They had a big auditorium.   The Cincinnati Convention Center.   A thousand people showed up.   Somewhere between a thousand and 1500.     Now prior to this big meeting there had been little meetings.   Secret meetings.   Joe and a few other guys ...   From Illinois ...   Texas Arizona.   They would been going back and forth.   By phone by mail.   One point they even met up.   In a motel in Florence Kentucky.   And they decided to form a small but fierce faction within the NRA.   And your secret group did you -- did you have a name? Did you call it something?   We were called the Federation For the NRA.   Called ourselves that. The Federation For the NRA.   And this tiny group planned a coup.     It was a hot steamy night in Cincinnati.   The Federation members were all wearing buttons that said National Rifle Association with the word 'Rifle' underlined.   We wore orange hats.   We had walkie-talkies to connect with each other.   How many people were there?   Somewhere between 10 and 15 of us.   They spread out through the crowd.   So how does the meeting start? Do you remember?   Well basically you know they did all the niceties.     Pledge of Allegiance.     Opening prayer.     When it came time for the members' part of the meeting where members submit proposals which happens in like this super parliamentary sort of way. This guy ...   Neil Knox.   He was part of their group.   He kind of bull rushed the microphone and he said The gathered members have a list of bylaws that they would like to have voted on.   Translation. We have got these 15 demands.   These 15 demands. I am not sure if that is more or less than Martin Luther.   The demands are basically number one we demand that the NRA not move its headquarters.   Cancel that.   We demand the Institute for Legislative Action which you want to kill should have more power.   Hell yes. Hell yes.   And we demand that the current NRA leadership be replaced.   We wanted to take over.   So the Federation guys making all these demands ...   What was crazy was that the -- the leadership of the NRA ...   That was running the meeting ...   They just sat there. They were like dumbfounded. But ...   Every time the Federation guy would make a motion ...   Judge Porter would say ...     You know do I have a second?     And then the floor debate would begin. People would start to speak for and against each amendment. The Federation members would use their walkie-talkies to coordinate who spoke at what microphone.   How many votes did you need that day?   I think at least 600 votes.   And how many votes did you think you had? If you needed 600 or so how many did you think ...   We had not the slightest idea.   Going in we anticipated 50-50 support.   So as each of the 15 amendments are being debated the insurrectionists are running around in their orange caps with their walkie-talkies trying to rally support from everyone.   That discussion debate lasted eight hours.   It went from 00 pm.   Until close to four oclock in the morning.   00 am?   Yeah.   And nobody left. They were all there.   There were tense moments. I mean we really did not know whether we could pull this off.   But Joe says one of the big turning points is when a guy named Bob Kukla gets up to the mic. He was at the time the head of the Institute for Legislative Action. He gets up to the mic.   And he played a tape.   You remember cassette tapes right? This was one that Bob Kukla secretly recorded.   I do not know how he did it.   But what you hear on this tape is Bob Kukla talking to his bosses at the NRA and they are yelling at him.   Berating him for going to war every time somebody talks about gun control.   They are basically like Bob shut up!   He had the tape there and he played it over the ...   He played it -- yeah right. And of course that electrified the audience.   You could actually hear people gasping.   So the rank and file was audibly ...   This was -- this was evidence that the other side was going to deep-six the gun control fight.   These people on the tape they are all in the room.   Oh yeah they are -- they are sitting next to him at the table.   Over the course of this one nine-hour meeting on a hot steamy night in Cincinnati every single one of those 15 proposals was passed.   We stopped the building in Colorado.   Ensured the NRA would not change its name. They fired the leadership.   You know just like the political savants that figured that Hillary's gonna get the presidency they just absolutely took it in their shorts.   And maybe the biggest change the most important change was that the Institute for Legislative Action this political lobbying arm of the NRA it was given the keys to the car. They were not the bastard stepchild anymore. They were the NRA.   You know what? We won.   They had essentially staged a coup.   What do they call 1776? It is the same thing.   And when the sun rose the very next day the NRA had a whole new board committed to a new no-compromises view of the Second Amendment in which individuals have a right not only to have a gun but to have almost any gun that they want and have as many of them as they want and can take those guns almost any place they want. American gun politics literally changed overnight.   And just shortly after this coup the NRA bolts this abridged version of the Second Amendment right on the wall front and center in its headquarters.   The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.   Nice clean totally uncomplicated sentence.   Conveniently left out was the part that talked about a well-regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state.   I asked John like what about the militia part of the sentence? Why does not the NRA ever talk about that?   The militia? Okay now you are getting me back to asking you if -- and Sean I love you dearly trust me. But it is only been in the last what 30 years that if you will pardon the expression the bullshit media has turned the militia into a four-letter word. The militia is you and me Sean.   Post-coup the NRA took a very hard line on gun control and became an irrepressible political force in America.     They start pouring millions of dollars into lobbying and just a few years after that Cincinnati revolt the NRA endorses its first presidential candidate.     Reagan?   Reagan.     At this point everyone and their uncle leaves out the militia part of the Second Amendment which is why Americans eventually start to forget that the militia clause or whatever you want to call it even exists.     One of the things that most surprised me when I was doing this research ...   This is Jill Lepore again.   I think by the 1990s the new interpretation of the Second Amendment had so penetrated popular opinion that people were more familiar with the Second Amendment than with the First by 1991. The First Amendment! That eclipse really kind of shocks me.   But even if -- even if the Panthers and the President and the American people are all down to sort of forget about this militia clause of the Second Amendment it did not mean a lot without the courts. And the courts particularly the Supreme Court were not buying it.     Warren Burger. I think he is on giving a television interview and he says that this new interpretation of the Second Amendment was ...     One of the greatest pieces of fraud. I repeat the word fraud ...     And this was a Republican appointed by Richard Nixon no?   Yeah. Yeah.   Yeah so the Supreme Court obviously not dying to have this conversation at the moment. But it is not just the Supreme Court if you look at the federal courts the entire federal court system in America there has not once in our history at this point over 200 years been a single instance of some gun law some state local gun law getting up to a court and the court going You know what? You cannot do this. It violates the Second Amendment. That is just not even happening.   Really?   Not even ...   There was not a Second Amendment smackdown anywhere in federal court?   This is not -- this is not a thing.   Wow!   And getting the Supreme Court to weigh in on it? That does not even look like it could be a thing. It does not even look like much more than a fantasy until ...     Dick Heller showed up.     And changed everything.     This is The Gun Show for More Perfect featured here on Radiolab. We will continue in a moment.     Heller in 2008 revives the Second Amendment. Or you could even say breathes life into the Second Amendment because the Second Amendment had never been taken truly seriously by federal courts until 2008.   That is Sandy Levinson professor at the University of Texas law school. I am Jad Abumrad here with Sean Rameswaram. All right so Sean ...   Jad.   It is -- I guess now it is time for Chapter 3 Dick Heller right?   Yeah we are gonna get to Dick but first here's what is going on in America. The Second Amendment has become one of those issues that can get you elected. Academics have begun to have a vigorous debate about its meaning. But the Supreme Court is still staying out of it. They are leaving this up to the states which already have all sorts of gun laws of their own to deal with. But then ...     But then George W. Bush is elected. The NRA likes George W. Bush.     And he likes them.     And in 2001 the Bush Administration declared that the Second Amendment protected an individual right to own guns.   UCLA law professor Adam Winkler again.   A right that was not limited as most courts had held to service in the militia.   And almost right after he gets into office Bush's Attorney General ...   John Ashcroft put out a letter.   This public letter to the NRA ...   Announcing that the Department of Justice had adopted a new interpretation of the Second Amendment.   And then ...   Right around the same time as the Bush Administration memo came out a court in Texas ruled that the Second Amendment did protect an individual right to bear arms.   And that was a first. It is a big deal. Before this all the decisions had kind of veered in the other direction.   And because of that court ruling and John Ashcroft's letter these three libertarian lawyers Alan Gura ...   Constitutional attorney.   Bob Levy ...   I chair the board at the Cato Institute.   And Clark Neily.   He is at Cato too.   Thought the timing was right.   We thought that it was a good time for some litigation.   Now one thing you need to know about these guys is that they were not necessarily doing it for the guns.   They had no association with the NRA or the gun rights movement.   For them it was more about getting the government to back off.   In our country when the government wants to restrict our liberty it is incumbent on the government to make the case for it. It is incumbent on the government to say Here's why you should not be permitted to exercise that right.   So that was their angle.   That is -- that is interesting. I have always wondered why the gun rights movement has become such a proxy war for like anti-government-ism.   Yeah. Well I mean if you think about it and this is something Professor Sandy Levinson told me is that sort of embedded in this amendment is the very idea that you can take up arms ...   Against the government ...   ... to protect yourself and your fellow man from tyranny.   On the far right or occasionally on the far left you find people who are willing to say this that this is really what is terrific about the Second Amendment. But mainstream conservatives and mainstream liberals are not very happy with those arguments. They are embarrassed by them. And so mainstream conservatives want to talk about self-defense against burglars and mainstream liberals want to talk about how the Second Amendment protects state-organized militias and almost nothing else.   Anyway getting back to the story these three libertarian lawyers they decide to put together a case. And their idea was to target this really restrictive gun law in DC.   All handguns were banned. You could own a shotgun or a rifle but the law specifically made it illegal to ever put a round in the chamber even in self-defense. So there was -- there is really -- we described it as a ban on all functional firearms.   But in order to challenge that law they needed to find a plaintiff.   Interesting. How do you find a plaintiff? You look for somebody who got robbed? What do you do?   Well we can actually instigate litigation. We can take out a full-page ad in the New York Times saying You want to vindicate your Second Amendment rights? Give us a ring.   We just essentially got the word out. Talked to I would say between two and three dozen people.   They all had really interesting stories.   They found a guy who was gay.   Gentleman named Tom Palmer.   Who had previously been assaulted when he lived in California because he was gay.   Was almost murdered by a skinhead mob.   Homophobic thugs.   And he wanted a gun to protect himself.   Our lead plaintiff was an African American woman named Shelley Parker.   She was trying to protect herself against local drug dealers and the cops actually told her she should get a gun which was illegal.   Weird.   So they had this whole group.   So we ended up with three men three women mid-twenties to their early-60s. Four of them were white two of them were African American.   And the problem they ran into was that all of these super sympathetic plaintiffs did not have this very special thing they needed to bring a case.   Standing.   Standing.   Which is just a legal term meaning they did not have a sufficient grievance to be in court.   Like if you are gonna bring a case ...   You have to show that you have been actually harmed by not being able to get a gun.   You have to show some physical concrete proof that harm has been done that you have been denied a gun. And none of the plaintiffs had that. Except for one guy.   Dick?   Are you Sean?   I am. That is me. Great to meet you.   And you.   Dick Heller.   And what does your hat say?   Sean this is my favorite hat. Make America Free Again.   So he actually gets paid by the Freedom.      With a big Western handgun in the center.   And it looks like you drew a trigger on there. Is that what you did?   Well it was missing the trigger so we had to update it.   Who is we?   Me.   Okay.   I met Dick right outside the Supreme Court the building where he became famous. He is a slim 75-year-old white guy sports glasses that look straight out of the '70s.   Got a situation here. You want to cross?   Sure. What is the situation?   The anti-Trump protesters are here.   I actually happened to meet him in DC the day after Trump won the election.   They hate freedom apparently.     The President-elect was visiting the White House. They were protesters everywhere.   Pull out your knife. Not my president. They are anti-Trump protesters. Do not you like freedom?     What about freedom? What about freedom?   Most of the protesters that were passing us were white but just as a few young Black men pass us by he says ...   See you on the plantation!   Love trumps hate.   Freedom! Freedom!   See you on the plantation.   Yeah.   Why'd you say that?   We -- in Washington we call it the government plantation.   You did not mean you kids are about to be slaves or something? Because that is how I interpreted it.   Well yeah. The more power government has the less freedom you have. The closer you get to ball and chain of a plantation. There is a pretty good place to eat right there if you here for a couple of days. Have you been in there?   I have not.   Yeah pretty good.   Okay. Hyatt Regency this is good for you? We can do this?   Sure. Yeah.   Great.   We ended up talking at the Hyatt which is just down the street from the Supreme Court. And -- and Dick explained to me that his journey with guns like John and Joe began pretty casually. Like 1976 he is living in DC. And one day he is sitting at home.   I was watching my hero Matt Dillon Gunsmoke.   Different Matt Dillon.   And he had this long-barreled handgun. I was about 30 years old and I figured Golly I should own my first gun. So I went and bought my -- what I call my Matt Dillon special. High-standard .22 revolver Matt Dillon buntline. And it was just I live in America. We are a cowboy society I should have a cowboy gun. And it was just nothing no really deep thought to it.   But then just a few months after he got that gun ...   In October of 1976 ...   A trend that started with the Mulford Act and the Black Panthers back in Sacramento hits Washington DC.   DC gun control regulations outlawed firearms ownership.   You get that gun law which outlawed all handguns.   So I had some choices. I could turn it into the government. Not gonna happen. I can throw it in the dipsy dumpster. Not gonna happen. Or there was another option. I could go to jail. Not gonna happen.   Eventually he decides on option  give the gun to his brother.   Well my brother lived in Maryland so that made it very convenient.   Did you just go visit your gun in Maryland? What did you do?   Yes. I would go visit and caress and use my gun.   What did you use it for?   Target practice of course.   Dick made his gun visitation situation sound functional but I think like any long-distance relationship it mostly sucked because more and more he did not feel safe where he lived.   I lived about 10 blocks from the Capitol building right across the street from the number one most infamous drug dealer den in the city called Kentucky Courts. Every night at 00 am the chief drug dealer would fire a nine-millimeter into the air empty the clip and that was the signal every night at two oclock that drug dealing was over for the day.   It is clear that living through the crack epidemic in DC really shaped a lot of Dick's views on guns. So in the years after the handgun ban Dick starts the very long process of finding a way to get his gun back to DC. And he eventually even quits his desk job to pursue getting his gun back full time.   I am all over Capitol Hill and I see security guards have guns. Well golly! Why cannot I be a security guard? Golly! Maybe that would help me have a gun that I cannot have on my own. Golly! Let us see how easy or not easy this is. Golly! One step leads to another.   Golly! Just like that Dick was able to have a gun in DC but only during the day and only while he was working.   Like Barney Fife at the end of my shift I have to turn in my gun and my bullet.   And they kept it there?   And they kept it on site in the safe yes.   He finally starts looking for some help some legal help.   But I knew Washington because I lived here and I would gone to some think tanks Cato and Heritage and some others. I knew they existed.   And right around the time Dick's out there looking for some help turns out these lawyers are out there looking for some Dick.    No. No.   He was not their ideal sympathetic guy.   I was told repeatedly and it was in print that I was the worst choice.   It was less than optimal.   You know because of that plantation thing he said or he would always talk smack about the federal government in interviews.   One day Clark Neily put a note in my hand and said Dick Heller this is what you say 'I just wanted a gun to protect my house.' Shut up.   So he was not their favorite plaintiff but ...   Dick did one thing that no one else had done which is besides just wanting an illegal handgun in DC he actually fill out an application to register a gun that he already possessed again in Virginia and had that application denied.   And he had this denial slip or whatever it is called. He like literally had this physical proof of his grievance. And this simple technical arbitrary little stupid piece of paper gave him what is known as standing to bring the case.   Dick Heller ended up being kind of last man standing. That was nothing to do -- that was not our choice.   Regardless he became their guy and these three lawyers they take the case to the DC court.   And the judge after inspecting it said the case can go forward. Magic moment.     Chapter 3. The Reckoning   March 18th 2008.   The day the Heller case was argued at the Supreme Court everyone understood how high the stakes were. Outside in front of the Supreme Court protesters by the hundreds were marching and chanting in favor of gun rights and in favor of gun control. Journalists from all over the world descended upon the Supreme Court that day. And inside the Supreme Court House ...   Not a creature was stirring ...   Not even a mouse.   You coulda heard a mouse I say. And everybody is just quiet and you can hear your heart beating. And suddenly bam! And then Oyez oyez oyez the clerk yelled at the top of his lungs. And then there is this strange sound. What can that be? It was the swishing of the robes of the justices as they ascended the steps to the bench. Unbelievable!     This was the first time in our history the Supreme Court would directly try to figure out what the Second Amendment means.     And immediately ...     And he sort of begins with this central question. Like what was James Madison thinking when he wrote this super confusing sentence like 200 years ago? Was he thinking about the individual people and their right to own a gun? Or was he thinking about the collective right of the militia to own a gun?     And he says if you look at the phrase ...     How it was used at the time ...     Dellinger says that if you look at some of Madison's rough drafts of the Second Amendment it is pretty clear that when he says people have a right to bear arms all he really means is like report for duty.       Chief Justice Roberts jumps in and is like Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.     If they meant just the people in the state militias ...           At this point everyone sort of jumps in. A bunch of justices start interrupting each other. It is kind of like a scrum. And they are all trying to figure out okay so when Madison wrote the phrase ...     Like who were the people he was talking about?     Was the people just the militia or everyone all the people? What is the relationship between the second part of the sentence the people part and the first part of the sentence the militia part?     They go into like ...     Common law.     Scottish Highlanders for some reason. At one point ...     They even sort of start to diagram Madison's sentence.     And the net result according to Adam Winkler was the four liberals ...   Stevens Souter Breyer Ginsburg.   Seem to want to emphasize the militia part of the sentence. And then you had the four conservative justices.   Scalia Thomas Alito Roberts.   Who seem to want to emphasize the people part of the sentence. The second part.     And Team People's team captain the quarterback the first chair that day was without a doubt Justice Antonin Scalia.     Justice Scalia of course was a very conservative Justice.   Grew up in Queens.   This is Joan Biskupic.   Long-time reporter covering the Supreme Court.   She is also written a biography of Justice Scalia.   He was an avid hunter and he grew up at a time when young men were trained in firearms in high school.     Even from the time he was a kid at school in Queens he said he used to carry his gun for rifle practice at school on the subways of New York.   Can you imagine doing that today in New York City?       What you hear throughout the arguments is that Scalia is very very forwardly pressing the sort of individual rights argument.     And justices like David Souter ...     Are arguing back saying What about the collective? The militia? This goes on for well over an hour the justices sort of grilling the lawyers arguing amongst themselves everybody trying to figure out what was in James Madison's head. Until finally Justice Breyer one of the liberal justices is like ...     Hold the phone!     Forget what Madison intended. There is no way for us to know. Let us talk about now. Let us talk about gun violence. This sentence was most definitely written about muskets. What about handguns and assault rifles? What is reasonable now?       Alan Gura basically argues when you take away people's guns they are gonna be less prepared if and when they enlist in the Army. To which Justice Breyer's like They can still practice shooting ...     Which were not banned in DC.           That by the way was Justice Scalia telling Alan Gura how to answer Justice Breyer's question.     Anyway the oral arguments last 97 minutes far longer than most other cases. And going into the arguments ...   Many Supreme Court watchers figured the case would be a close 5-4 decision. And it could go either way.   And as with all of these close cases ...   The question was what would Anthony Kennedy the swing Justice do? As in so many issues in America it comes down to what does Anthony Kennedy believe? So at the oral argument and I had the good fortune to be at the oral argument in the Heller case everyone was looking to hear what would he say about the Second Amendment? His was really the vote that counted. And the very first comment he made ...     One of the first things he said was about bears. Like not bear arms but grizzly bears. And the point Kennedy was trying to make was clear do not you think the framers had other reasons that they wanted people to have guns other than just being in a militia? Like what about people being in their homes and just needing to defend themselves?   And that is when I silently screamed at the top of my lungs so nobody could hear me. Yes! We win! dot-dot-dot something.         It was a groundbreaking reading of the Second Amendment. Scalia minimized that clause referring to a well-regulated militia and put the stress on the second clause that referred to the right of the people.     This was as good as it got for him on the bench.   I think so.   RIP the militia clause. December 15 1791 to June 26 2008. A pretty good run if I am being honest. For the first time in the history of these United States the courts definitively declared that the Second Amendment gives every American the right to a gun for self-defense.   It was a -- it was a great day for freedom in America. It was a great day for the Constitution. A great day for citizens. It was great day for gun owners. It was a great day for fearful people.   Of course not everyone agreed.   I mean to me that is a travesty.   This is Jack Rakove.   Professor of history and political science at Stanford University.   He filed a brief for the court and he says Scalia's reading of the history is just wrong.   The Second Amendment was not about individual right.   You could argue that we should not even be talking about history.   Because the nature of firearms has changed so radically from the 18th century to our own time.   And that ultimately -- and here he echoed Justice Stevens in his dissent.     I think it is all politics to be honest. I mean I do not really believe in constitutional law anymore. I think constitutional law is a fiction. You know it is become so highly politicized in so many areas. I think constitutional law is bunk.   Wow!   I just -- you know I am a historian I am not a lawyer so I do not have any professional stake in defending the judiciary.   But -- there is a very big but.   We did have a major caveat.     He said like all rights it is not absolute.     Which is very important to keep in mind.     And this is another thing that we tend to forget. The decision says every individual has a right to bear arms but most interestingly like the decision also says of course we need gun control. The word Heller has come to represent like Second Amendment rights. Like are you for Heller or are you against Heller? Even though being for Heller is being for gun control.   That is confusing.   Yeah it is. I mean after all this time it is still just totally confusing. You have a right to a gun but the government has a right to regulate it. Dick Keller gets his gun back in DC but DC still also has all sorts of gun regulations. And you see the same pattern all over the country. Some states are lenient some are super strict and both approaches seem to comply with Heller. In a way the Heller Decision is just like all those commas and clauses that we started with in James Madison's sentence. It is this confusing declaration that leaves the door wide open for interpretation. Which obviously sucks. We could have used a little more clarity on how to live with this Second Amendment right to bear arms. But that door being open it gives us an opportunity I think. An opportunity to get it right to fix it. And it seems like now would be a pretty good time.   That was The Gun Show from More Perfect and producer Sean Rameswaram. Huge thanks to him.
