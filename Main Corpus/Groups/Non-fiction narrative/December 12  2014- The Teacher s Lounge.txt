 OK so seventh-grade lunchtime and I have got a tummy ache. It hurts so bad. I need some pink liquid or something. I can barely move and 'ecause there is no adults around I push open the door to the teacher's lounge and I see Ms. Martin  sitting on Mr. Kudrow's  lap snuggling all close both of them sharing the last drag of a cigarette. They look over at me. She jumps up with a quickness - cigarette stomped in the carpet blouse straightened up buttons checked. Uh-oh. I close the door. I figure my stomach maybe does not hurt as bad as I thought it did - try to hurry away but they rush out. Want to talk all up in my face - how are things? How is that project coming? How is your brother? By the by you should know that sometimes people see things that look one way when there is another perfectly good explanation and it is very bad to spread rumors. And I agree with everything they are saying but certain things you just cannot unsee. Today on SNAP JUDGMENT from PRX and NPR Behind The Curtain. Amazing stories from real people who for one reason or another stumble across a backstage pass. My name is Glynn Washington and I promise there is nothing to see back here because you are listening to SNAP JUDGMENT.
