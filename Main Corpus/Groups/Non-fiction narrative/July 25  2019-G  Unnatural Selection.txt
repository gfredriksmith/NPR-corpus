   Hey this is Radiolab. I am Pat Walters. And today we have the fifth episode of our miniseries ...     G. Last episode we had a story from Lulu Miller about eugenics. It was all about scientists who were applying the Darwinian idea that species can be shaped by natural selection to humans. To us. Like instead of waiting for nature to choose which individuals of the human species were most quote-unquote fit they thought they could speed things along and in the process create like a perfect human race. Which as we got into last time was a disaster. And at a certain point Lulu argued that these eugenicists in emphasizing like their one narrow idea of perfection over everything else they sort of missed the point of Darwin.   Darwin talks about one thing this one ingredient that he marvels at he does not understand why its there. The thing to which we all owe our existence on Earth. Variation.   Variation. That like what makes a species resilient is difference. But    Ah that is a very selective reading of Darwin you know?   Turns out not everyone agrees with her.   It is true of course that variation is really important to evolution but it is variation coupled with selection that actually gives you success. So you know I disagree with her interpretation.   So not too long after we talked to Lulu I did an interview with a scientist who takes a very different position on all this. And he is come into a bit of controversy. Some people argue that he is taking those old ideas that certain people can decide which humans are fit enough to exist and which ones are not.   I think you have to be very careful because nobody here is trying to optimize one specific trait or number. What we are doing is identifying outcomes that I think most people agree maybe are not good.   And arguably hes walking those ideas into the future.   Hello?   Okay to back up a beat.   Hello.   Hi. Is this Steve?   Yeah this is Steve. Whos this?   Hi Steve. This is Pat.   Hey Pat how are you?   This is Steve Hsu.   I am a theoretical physicist who also works in computational genomics.   Steve's in his early-50s has short black hair little wire-rimmed glasses. And he says he is been interested in genomics the power of DNA really since he was a kid.   Yeah actually so when I was a kid I watched too much TV.    Is that right?   Yeah this was the '70s. There was no parenting going on.    Okay.   Things were so laissez-faire back then. And so when I went home in the afternoons the very favorite thing I would watch was Star Trek the original Star Trek.   Mm-hmm.     With William Shatner as Kirk and ...     Spock.   And in the Star Trek universe in the late 20th Century ...     They had the so-called Eugenics Wars in which some genetic supermen were created ...      by technology.       You know they were smarter and more capable. And they almost took over the Earth. And all that was quite vivid in my mind when I was growing up.   And he says it also made him wonder. Steve like lots of kids growing up in the 1970s had to take an IQ test at some point and he says he scored really high. Like in the top 99 percentile. And he thought to himself why is that?   Am I getting better vitamins? Is it because my mom and dad you know make me go to bed early at night? Is it environmental causes that are making me different from my peers or is there something different about my DNA?   And he says he at one point took this question to his local library.   I found this whole section where they had book after book about studies done on identical twins how they measure IQ or how they measure cognitive ability. So I just -- it was very stark in my mind that something about our DNA could influence the power or effectiveness of your brain.   This was still the late 1970s though and at this point science just was not quite ready to tackle those questions in a serious way.   At that time we had way to actually directly measure DNA. And even by the time I was in college we had not -- we were nowhere being able to sequence a human genome.   So Steve went in a different direction. He went to grad school for physics.   Said Well I am gonna work on black holes and quantum field theory because where I ... you know it would take huge technological breakthroughs for us to make progress on these questions in my lifetime.   But ...     It would not take as long as he thought.   Yes because 15 years later ...   This is when roughly?   This was 2000 ...     June 26th 2000 to be exact.     Standing behind a podium in the East Room of the White House President Bill Clinton announced ...     I saw it come to fruition.           The huge advances in our capability to read out somebody's DNA.   And along with these advances Steve watched as the price of all this ...     Dropped dramatically.     This kind of super exponential decrease.       In cost of genotyping.         And I realized wow.     If this technology's advancing this rapidly ...       Some of these crazy science fiction ideas about genomics and genetic engineering will come true. And if I get to be one of the scientists who makes real some amazing trope from science fiction that would be the most awesome thing in the world.   And you might be thinking -- I was anyway -- that maybe Steve missed the point of that Star Trek episode about the Eugenics Wars but that was his interpretation.   So those thoughts were in my mind when I thought what is it gonna take for us to figure out the genetic architecture of human intelligence?   So around 2011 Steve started to pivot from physics to genomics.   Just hoping to find a particular place in the genome that was influencing IQ score. But now ...     Steve and his team ran into a problem.       Genetics turned out to be way more complicated than a lot of people thought at first.       The initial hope had been like let us find the one gene that causes this trait and the one mutation that causes this disease. And in early years scientists found a few of those sort of one-to-ones but only a few.   They failed to turn up you know some of the hidden connections they had expected to find or they turned up stuff but then they could not be replicated.     Um that was kind of the -- the first phase.   This is Meghan Molteni.   I am a staff writer at Wired.   And as she explained to us ...   What they found was that there are ...   It quickly became clear that most traits in a human being are not caused by a single gene or even a handful of genes. They often arise out of the complex interaction of hundreds or thousands or even tens of thousands of genes and other bits of DNA working in concert. So the challenge sort of shifted. It wasnt about finding a single gene or mutation for any one thing. It was about mapping these huge swathes of the genome and looking for variations.   And so we realized we need many many more genotypes and much much more data.   And so how they addressed that was they actually began banding together into these big international consortia.   To pool together data.   Hmm.   And dial up the statistical power for everyone.   So in 2017 ...   The UK BioBank dumps 500000 genomes into the public square.     At some point 23andMe provides contributions.   Other researchers throw their data into the mix.   And so by the summer of 2018 they are comparing the DNA of 1.1 million people.   And so you have this giant data set that essentially launched this next wave of genetic studies.   Yes that is the data set that has been studied to produce predictors.   And that kind of brings us to -- so that kind of brings us to these genome-wide association studies.   So explaining these can get pretty complicated but the basic idea is this. Let us say you have a bunch of tall people and you want to find out what makes them tall genetically. So you take the genomes of all the tall people billions and billions of letters and you feed that data into a computer. The computer then scans all the billions of letters and it looks for patterns. Like what do these people have in common? And the computer might say like Hmm a bunch of them have a certain mutation at spot 273674. And a bunch of them also have a mutation in spot 923672. And another mutation in spot 38479. And on and on and on. I am just making this up but Steve actually did this analysis for height.   And the AI algorithm identified about 20000 different locations in your genome that determine height.   Or at least influence height. So 20000 spots in the genome that have some influence over how tall you are. In the biz this is called training the algorithm. And once it is trained once it is found all of these patterns ...   Once it has figured all of that out ...   What you can then do is prediction.   For people that it is never seen before.   So what you do is you take the genome of someone new.   What we call out of sample data. This person is not involved in the training.   And feed just their genome into the algorithm.   Does this guy have A or B at this location? How about at this location? How about at this location? You do that 20000 times. And then the thing will predict this guy's gonna be 6'2.   Wait and how accurate exactly is this thing?   Well so we recently just a year and half ago succeeded in building a predictor which has an accuracy of about plus or minus an inch.   That is pretty amazing.   Yeah.   And we do not know like what those genetic variations are doing we just know that the computer said there is something different happening in these places for the taller people than for the other people.   That is correct. The AIs are almost like black boxes. You train them and then you got to carefully test them but once -- once you validate that it is like oh my God the lord or the martians just came and gave me this black box which does this thing. It predicts height.   And not just height.   We have a pretty good bone density predictor. It turns out that is pretty heritable.   Huh.   Things like diabetes atrial fibrillation breast cancer prostate cancer.   Wow.   So you can -- you can GWAS like literally anything.   Again Megan Molteni.   And so where this gets interesting is that ...   Perhaps unsurprisingly just in the last year or so ...   Steve Hsu starts wanting to use these genome-wide association studies as a way to predict intelligence. Intelligence is a complex trait. So we know there are genes involved. We know there are lots of them but environment so where you grow up even how much you get to eat like all of that matters too.   But based on dozen of studies lots of them done on twins when it comes to intelligence or cognitive ability basically whatever we want to call what an IQ test measures which as we know has its limitations ...   The evidence that we know today suggests the genes are responsible for somewhere between 20 to 50 percent of how smart people are or how we can -- how we can measure what we call intelligence.   And so that gives you hope that if you had enough data your AI algorithm could figure out how to crudely predict cognitive performance from -- from your genotype alone.   Now as Steve set out to do this the first hurdle he and his team ran into was ...   Only a fraction of the 1.1 million people in the study had IQ score data available.   And without that it would be sort of impossible to predict someone's IQ.   But -- but nearly every GWAS researcher on the planet was collecting educational attainment. And that is just the number of years that people have been in school.   So from the million-plus people what they did know is like if the person had gotten a high school diploma or a PhD. And what Steve and actually a bunch of other researchers would eventually figure out is that the genetic pattern that predicts educational attainment ...   Is actually very good at predicting IQ. So it is quite comparable.   Flash-forward to today we have predictors for cognitive ability that correlate about 0.3 or 0.4 with actual IQ score.   So just to put that in context a correlation of 1 means the computer would be able to predict the IQ score exactly every time based on genetics alone. And a correlation of 0 means the computer would basically be guessing at random. So 0.3 to 0.4 like that does not seem ah very high to me. That actually seems pretty low.   Well that analogy let me give it to you this way. If you admit a bunch of kids to college and you have their SAT scores ...   Mm-hmm.   You can predict their GPA in college and the correlation between those two variables is also about 0.3 or 0.4.   Gotcha.   So we are kind of at that kind of level of capability from pure genome.   And the way Steves using that predictive capability ....   At the moment we are starting to use it in multiple clinics around the world.   That is where I start to get kind of freaked out. We will get into all that after a quick break.       Okay were back from break. Im Pat Walters this is Radiolabs G. Back to my discussion with Steve Hsu.   So you -- you also have a company.   Yeah. Actually it is a -- it is a tech start-up with investors venture funds and you know wealthy individuals.   And what is your company called again?   It is called Genomic ...     ... Prediction.   Okay and you -- you are starting to apply these things you have discovered to -- to testing.   Yes genetic testing for embryos.   So first of all the embryos we are talking about here are ones that were produced through IVF.   Yeah IVF kids.   You know basically test-tube babies. Take a little sperm an egg combine them in a Petri dish for later transfer.   So every year about a million babies are born worldwide using IVF.   A million. I didnt realize it was that high.   Yeah. Its about a million worldwide.   So that means there are actually many millions of embryos produced. Because when you do IVF you often produce more embryos than youll end up using. Which means that often times what IVF couples face is a choice.   Which embryos to use and which would be the best to use. And so it is now common to do genetic testing on those embryos.   But typically really basic stuff.   The most common thing right now is just to test to see whether the number of chromosomes is normal to screen against Down syndrome.   A relatively simple test.   That is by far the most common kind of genetic testing that is done. But now though if you think of the technical breakthroughs that I described to you you can -- you can screen against much more than just Down syndrome. And so the company that we started takes the same standard biopsy that is already used to do the chromosome count screening ...   But takes it a step further and actually sequences a chunk of the genome of that embryo.   ... and we can then apply all of the genomic predictors that I described to you to -- to an embryo. So the doc might say you know embryo number four looks like its definitely gonna have type one diabetes. Embryo number three has a very strange outlier for heart attack et cetera et cetera.   And you are applying the information you have about intelligence to those embryos and those decisions as well?   So that is the most challenging question and that is the one that everybody wants to focus on.   Yeah.   Because we can do it. But you know whenever a journalist contacts me even if the person I know has an unhealthy fixation on IQ and does not wanna talk about all the health -- positive health things ...   Mm-hmm.   ... associated with this technology and just wants to focus on the one thing that you know everybody gets heated up about I still ...   Yeah not naming names here.   Yeah. I still want to have the conversation because society needs to understand what is actually going on.   Yeah.   So our current policy and we arrived at this after really a lot of thought and not wanting to get out ahead of where society is on this the only thing that we report about the intelligence of the individual embryo is if the embryo is an outlier in risk for I think the medical term is gosh what is it? Is it mental disability? Something like that.   I think it is intellectual disability?   Intellectual disability right.   Yeah. And that the predictor would be saying that it is likely that this embryo would have uh an IQ score below a certain number?   Yes. I think intellectual disability is probably something like IQ of 75 or something like this. And it would mean that the IVF physician will get a report saying Embryo number four has a very unusually large number of the variants that depress intelligence. And I think that is a reasonable thing to want to know.   Are -- is there a parallel track happening in your mind? Because the -- the other people who have had -- gotten excited about making super-people besides the science fiction people are like the Nazis.   Yeah.   Yeah.   You know the idea that you would dehumanize some people because they are less able is extremely dangerous. But this notion that oh we should not do any of this research because there was a guy called Adolf Hitler ...   Right.   That is kind of crazy to me.   Explain why. Like how do you ...   I would say every technology really powerful technology whether it is AI or genomics or nuclear energy they have risks. That is always the case.   Sure. But I guess I dont trust the IQ part of it. Like its pretty well established that the IQ score isnt a good way to determine intellectual disability. Like I think its way more complicated than that.   Right but keep in mind none of this is a sure thing in the sense that we are not saying that we know embryo three will have IQ below 75. Were not saying that. Were just saying the chances the child will have a lot of difficulty in modern society that probability is elevated.   I guess this is maybe where we disagree is that like I dont -- Im not convinced you can know what the quality of someones life is gonna be like based on an IQ ...   Were not talking about any of that. Were just saying that conditional on that score if I go out in the population and I look at people with that score a lot of them have not had very you know I think positive lives. And Im pretty sure that most mothers when theyre pregnant when they go to sleep at night theyre not dreaming about that outcome. Theyre dreaming about another outcome for their children.   It just feels like a bad idea.   The only question here is imagine that your sister is going through IVF and you happen to have the genotypes of all the embryos of your sister's potential kids and you find out hey embryo four is predicted to be you know in less than the first percentile for cognitive ability.   Mm-hmm.   But all the other ones are in the normal range or maybe even above average. Would you tell your sister?   Uh ...   I mean that is the basic question right?   Yeah.   Who -- anyway we are gonna make some kind of brutal decision. Like okay these two we implant those eight we donate to science.   Yeah.   Right? So it was gonna happen anyway to eight of their 10 embryos right? So the thing is if we can help your sister a little bit let us help. That is my attitude.   Mine too.   I also wanna emphasize that typically the embryologist will actually just look at the shape. Like do the cells grow in a nice symmetrical pattern?   Huh.   They just literally look at the shape of it and say like Oh that one looks nice?   Yeah. Would your sister rather go with the gut feeling based on the shape or would she rather go with some genetic evaluation?   Well I do not know because -- it is probably really hard for parents to know -- to really interpret this information. They might just hear 75 and then hear probably intellectually-disabled. I do not want that. And I think that freaks me out.   Yeah I do think that we need really good genetic counseling so that people understand the world that we are entering into because again no one's saying that embryo four is gonna have IQ below 75. That is extremely bad. That -- that is actually not the message. The message is that the risks are a lot higher than for all your other embryos. Thats all were saying.   Well um ...   But as for what a lot higher really means ...   I mean theres different ways of quantifying the strength of the prediction. I think the way to interpret it is its a good predictor on average and thats what makes it useful in research.   I talked to this guy named Dan Benjamin.   But in general its not a good predictor at the individual level.   He is a professor of economics at USC. And one of the founders of that big consortium of scientists.   ... of the Social Science Genetic Association Consortium.   That helped pull together the million or so genomes that Steves genetic IQ predictor is effectively built on. And he says think about that comparison Steve made to the SAT.   You know its very hard to predict whos gonna do well in college. And SAT scores are among the better predictors of that.   Like on average the kids who score well on the SAT will do well in school.   But I mean if you look at a university ...     There are gonna be some pretty poor performers.     And you might ask yourself Why did the school admit those students?     Should not they have been able to tell ...     Those students were gonna do poorly and ...     ... the answer is they could not tell. For any individual person SAT scores are not a good predictor. There are just too many other things that matter.   And just to sort of shift away from the SAT back to like using a polygenic score to try to say something about an individual if you had to quantify what not a very good prediction means how would you do that?   Well if you picked two people randomly in the sample and you asked How likely is it that the one with the higher polygenic score is actually the one who got more years of schooling the answer is about 60 percent.   60 percent.   Yes. There is a 40 percent chance that youll get it backwards. And I think more to the point in the context of embryo selection the prediction is less likely to be right. Its gonna be something like reducing it from 60 percent to 55 percent.   So according to Dan these predictions can be useful in large groups but on an individual level they are just a little bit better than a coin toss.   So I worry that companies that are offering this service theyre exaggerating the potential gains and also are not being upfront about what the risks are.   Two things on that real quick. First Dan says because we dont really know how the genetic variations that predict IQ score really work if you select against them you might accidentally be selecting for other stuff like mental illnesses or certain diseases.   There are these risks and we dont even know what all of the risks are.   And number two which might even be more disturbing Dan says the genetic data all of this is based on came only from white people of European descent. Thats the only data they could get their hands on. And consequently if you try to use a test like Steve Hsus on someone who is not a white person of European descent it pretty much doesnt work. That correlation drops to the floor.   So even the possibility of doing it is pretty much limited to well-off white people at this point.   And so when Steve just sort of says with this confidence that the genetic predictor is pretty much like the SAT thats just not the whole story. Its more complicated than that. And what worries me is that you know you have guys like Dan Benjamin advocating for this more complex understanding of what the statistics really mean and you know saying theyre meaningful in big groups but theyre not meaningful in individuals. But you know on the other side you have Steves story which is just so straightforward and compelling. And you know if Steves story and Dans story have to face off I just feel like Steves will win every time. You know because his story is so simple.   It does feel like in the end what you are able to tell someone like is not that much because it is not a one-to-one predictor or even really close to that.   Well it will get better I guarantee you as we get more data. The -- the predictive power will get much better. And I think it will eventually achieve a kind of capability kind of like what we can do with height where you -- you know the -- the error is about an inch maybe plus or minus 10 points of IQ.   You know I will say that ...   Once again Megan Molteni.   Right now while he may be an outlier in terms of what hes willing to offer based on kind of where the models are now I dont think he will be an outlier for long. The information is going to become available and its only gonna get better.   And of course there are many ethical things that we have to sort out. And I think different societies will decide different things about how they want to deal with this. And so you know if a particular country said We do not want you to ever report anything about cognitive risks. We just dont want you to report that. I would totally respect that. But then I think you have to respect if the nation of Singapore if they decide this is an important thing to do well you better respect them too.   Mm-hmm.   Otherwise youre some kind of racist colonialist guy who says only my ethics count. So I realize -- you know I realize the NPR audience may not like it but you know this is the world that were entering into.   Have people used the tool yet? Like has the predictor tool been used by consumers yet?   So there are different segments to the product. The full-blown thing where you report genetic test scores polygenic scores for a variety of traits is in the process of being used.   What does the process mean? Like ...   Well you know I am not ready to report the birth of any child or anything. But let us just say samples have been analyzed.   Okay. And it is been -- and information has been provided to couples?   I do not know that I can comment on exactly any specifics along those lines. I would probably have to check with our CEO.   One last thing. Just the other day as we were finishing this story Steve wrote to us and said that while the company has provided risk reports to IVF doctors to various diseases like breast cancer and diabetes they have not quote Given a report warning of high risk for intellectual disability. Yet. And at the end of this I find myself thinking about the like thousands of couples out there who are doing IVF and the thousands more who will do it in the years and decades ahead and honestly wondering like ...   Im Rebecca Pitkin.   Im Kevin.   Im Rebecca Gardner.   Jill.   Im Kate.   Katie James.   I would love to just not use any name at all.   Would they want to know ...   We just finished our second cycle of IVF.   We have one embryo.   Im in the early stages of IVF cycle one.   ... what Steve Hsu can tell them?   Wow. Thats a really hard question.  Rebecca Kinda makes me feel uncomfortable.   Hmm. I think I would have a lot of anxiety over that decision.   When you hear that its not that accurate.   I mean everybody wants their children to be brilliant and healthy.   Um--  sorry one second. I dont see what harm it could do to test for that.   There are way too many questions that we would need to ask before we would ever consider that.   I think I would -- I would probably want to know.   You do want to know but then youre looking at a world where people who have a lot of money can select for the ones who are more intelligent.   If it were offered to me and it was not cost-prohibitive yeah I think I would move forward with the testing.   It is something I think we will test for if we can afford it.   Before we do our next round we probably will do genetic testing.   I have to think about it long and hard.   Yeah. Its a really tough question.
