  Sarah Qari?   Hello. Whoa! Hi!      You are coming through so clear. This is crazy!   It is pretty cool is not it?   Yeah.   Hey I am Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. Coronavirus dispatch number four. This one is sort of a follow-up to our first dispatch. And it comes from producer Sarah Qari.   In the last I want to say like 48 hours I feel like I have become a -- an armchair expert on  on how pathogens travel out of your mouth.   Just -- just to set it up. So like a couple days ago I mean it feels like 50 years ago the whole group got together on Zoom and we started talking about numbers.   At some level like I am sort of obsessed with all the numbers that are like coming out every day.   22 people here and 500 people there and    And I believe you had a question about numbers. A specific number.   Sure OK. A number that I have been thinking a lot about is six.        You mean like the distance were supposed to stand apart from one another?   Exactly.     Yeah it is funny now that you mention it. I feel like we are all developing this new physical instinct for -- for that distance. Like the other day I was at the -- the grocery store and I felt -- and I could see other people feeling like we all had these six-foot force fields around us and we were altering the arc of our walks so that we would go around each other's force fields.   Yeah totally!   Totally. And it made me wonder where did this number come from? And is six actually even the right number?   Okay.   You know researchers are really interested in this question.   So I called a bunch of experts that study this.   How far do infectious agents like bacteria and viruses spread?   One of them was Dr. Julie Fischer.   Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Georgetown University.   And when I talked to her ...   In the past one of the big questions was ...   ... I came across this history    It is a -- a very strange area of research.   The interesting thing about it too is that it is very much still evolving.   Well some of the older studies ...   Maybe the place to start is actually the 1930s.   In the 1930s theres this guy named William Wells who was studying different diseaseas. And he made this discovery... Like when you open your mouth. For example like when you are breathing or you are sighing every time you do that there is little particles that are flying out of your mouth. And eventually we learned that those particles are flying pretty much all of the time.   Just when you breathe not even when you sneeze?   Yeah. Yeah.   Everything I am gonna say just sounds gross.   People -- people sometimes expel small amounts of moisture when they are talking particularly if they are talking to someone very close up.   Wow its like little mouth rain.   Yeah exactly mouth rain.             Regardless of what youre doing when you open your mouth and let out air this is whats happening.   Okay.   What happens next is like over the next few decades scientists get really interested in how this works. And one of the first things they get really curious about is the common cold.   A lot of the research was done in England.     Right after World War Two in Salisbury in the UK ...   ...these scientists got together a bunch of volunteers.     The place is often nicknamed the Honeymoon Clinic.    Okay.   Because they frequently recruited couples.   Literally they would offer people a 10-day all-expenses-paid vacation in the Salisbury countryside.     In many instances volunteers were deliberately infected with influenza.   Researchers would take a little bit of cold virus put it in an eyedropper     ... shoot some virus up the honeymooners' noses and then they would watch to see what happened.   How easily did the people around them become infected? Did it require close contact? Could they just be in the same space?   I dont know if that sounds like a honeymoon anymore.   Totally it sounds like a raw deal but youd be surprised like people at the time like found this so appealing. People essentially just saw it as like an ideal budget holiday.   .   Anyhow...Jumping ahead a few years   In later experiments not at this clinic but in later experiments they would have you know like do things oh have infected and non-infected people sit together and play a game of cards for a bunch of hours. And then see how the disease has traveled from person to person.   Oh they would have like sick people and healthy people play together and see who got sick?   Exactly. Also they were quite interested in like when people sneezing and coughing and like expelling again these droplets into the air like how far are those traveling. And so one of the things that came out of these studies is that for the common cold they found the droplets the droplets are going about...   That is where we came up with the three feet.    three feet.   And this is three feet not through contact. This is just the mouth rain?   Right. So simply being within three feet of someone puts you within the blast radius of their mouth rain.   Got it.   For many many years that was the sort of reigning understanding that like if you are gonna have a bubble around you it should have a three-foot radius. But then scientists realize that three feet might not be enough. And the way that they realize this is that in the early 2000s ...    when there are outbreaks of different kinds.   2000s! So this is recent!   Yeah. Yeah it is pretty recent. So ...     When there are outbreaks of different kinds like SARS ...     H1N1 or swine flu.   Hmm.   Scientists and epidemiologists start to look at the patterns of how the disease is spreading. And actually one type of information that was really useful to these scientists ...   This source of information actually comes from a lot of times with the airlines.   So this is Dr. Albert Ko.   I am at the Yale School of Public Health.   He is the chair of the Epidemiology Department there.   So these are kind of these natural experiments.   Where somebody has a respiratory illness and they know how many seats in front and how many seats in back as well as in the side that people got sick.   Lets say youre an epidemiologist tracking SARS. And you discover that the person sitting in seat 29A has the illness. So you then track everybody else on the plane to see what happens and later find out that the person in 27A ended up getting sick too. So then you measure the distance between seat 29A and seat 27A and it turns out to be more than three feet.   They found that the people who had most risk were you know within two rows before and two rows behind which is about six feet.   I see so this is where it comes from?   Yeah. And so then the CDC looks at that and they update their guidance based on that.   Again the -- the assumption is that six feet is about the distance that a droplet can travel.   And so now with the virus that causes COVID-19 SARS COV-2...   Assuming that SARS COV is transmitted by droplets...   You can use that same rule.   You know its interesting as you were talking I kept thinking about that idea of 6 feet under. How how we bury people 6 feet under the ground which apparently we only started doing in the 1660s causes of The Plague. To stop infections. So its interesting it feels like kind of this through line number thats alway  thats somehow always been there when we talk about trying to prevent spread.   Right but that number is evolving.  This is Radiolab. Im jad Abumrad here with Sarah Qari. Weve been talking about the six foot rule when it comes to COVID-19 and how just over the past week or so that rule...             In order to have what people call this large spray transmision you need to be facing the person. And the way Ive seen choirs sing is they are all facing the same direction.   This is Linsey Marr.  Professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech.   She studies how diseases spread. And she says that choir anecdote where you had people just singing together and then a bunch of them getting sick   Ive gone through all the different scenarios in my head and really the simplest explanation is that it was being spread through the air.   Meaning not through droplets at all.   Or at least not through the droplets that fall to the ground. See weve known for a while that the mouth rain that comes out of your mouth when you talk the droplets come in different sizes. Therere the big droplets...   Kind of larger droplets you know that you can see almost with your visible eye or under a microscope.   But those arent the only ones.   Now we know that there are ones that are much smaller than that.   That as you talk thousands of these tiny air droplets fall out of your mouth.   That really we can only detect using modern equipment.   And theyre so small sometimes one-fiftieth of a human hair that instead of falling they float in these little mouth rain mist clouds.   We now have the ability to you know detect viruses in these very small particles in air.   And have we been able to measure that? I mean do we know for sure that the virus that causes COVID can can travel in those airborne particles? And if it can do we know how far it can go?   Well bear in mind that no one even knew that this virus existed until you know roughly three and a half months ago.   This is Ed Yong the science writer for The Atlantic Magazine.   In many cases were sort of starting from scratch but you know a study came out in the New England Journal of Medicine   In mid-March   ..showing that the virus could remain stable in airborne particles for an hour or perhaps even more.   Ugh   Although as many people have pointed out that was quite an artificial experiment.   It was done in the lab and it just wasnt clear exactly how it applied to real life.   You know it was evocative but it wasnta slam-dunk case.   But then   There was a study that came outÂ  Maybe its just a pre-print still but they collected air samples at the University of Nebraskawhich has one of the hospitals in the US thats you know specially designed for handling dangerous airborne pathogens.   This study by the University of Nebraska Medical Center was really important.   They found virus more than six feet away from the patient. They found it out in the hall. Um..   Whoa.   Wow.   So the virus is definitely traveling that far in air.   Well uh maybe not. I think that the reality of that situation is that you know we were going in and out of the rooms. So the likelihood is that   Ooh.  ... we were bringing it with us when we were going in and out.   This is Joshua Santarpia.   And Im an associate professor of pathology and microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.   Hes the guy who led this study. And he says when coronavirus hit back in the winter that people at his hospital   It got real really fast.   Hundreds of passengers quarantined over coronavirus on the Diamond Princess cruise ship are preparing to leave.   Our first covid-positive folks came from the Diamond Princess.   The cruise ship that was quarantined in Japan back in early February.   They asked us to take 13 and it wound up being a total of I think 15.   Iin addition to treating these people Josh and his team swabbed little spots all over the rooms and took samples from the air looking for the virus.   I was a little surprised by how much we found.   Josh says he doesnt think the virus floated down the hallway.   Based on this particular study its hard to say how far it went but uh we found evidence of virus in and around their entire room.   Not only on things people touched   Their remote controls for their television   But also   In the air.   Just floating around. And landing in all these nooks and crannies of the room.   Um the air handling grates.   Under the bed.   On the wall. It -- There wasnt a single kind of sample that we took that didnt have some evidence.   And these are intact viruses that youre finding? Like ready to jump into somebody and make them sick?  No.  One thing to point out here is that the evidence of virus Josh found wasnt like actual live virus.   Yeah. So it was viral RNA in those samples.   What they find instead are traces of the virus genetic material which is more like finding the fingerprint of a suspect. Which suggests that they were once there at quarantine but might not actually be there any longer.   It could be that the virus floated down and came to rest on a surface and then disintegrated. Like we know this virus doesnt do well in the environment. But the thing is like even if it had stayed intact Josh says he cant tell yet if the viral spillage that hes seeing around the room is enough...   To you know to be capable of causing infection.   In other words was there actually enough live virus floating across the room to make somebody sick.   Yeah.   Have you made any attempt to figure out how far viruses that could make someone sick can float?   So thats the question that Im currently trying to answer with the work that were doing now.   For now Josh says he doesnt really know....It seems like its more than 6 feet...But is it 10? 15? 20? Nobody knows.   I personally have been using a 10-foot-rule. And the farther the better.   Interesting. Okay.   So if you think about someone whos smoking when youre close to them theres the cloud of smoke. But as you know as that smoke disperses eventually like a 20 30 40 feet away down the block its you know its not a dense cloud of smoke anymore. So the same thing viruses behave in the same way in the air.   Oh thats interesting that gives me a visual.   Yeah.   That does make me wonder do you I mean...do you hold your breath?   I mean in theory it should help. Ive done that when I run past someone Ill hold my breath for a few seconds. I dont know if it makes a difference but in theory it could.   The thing that makes the biggest difference -- and like every expert I talk to reminded me of this -- is just not going anywhere unless you absolutely have to. Dont worry about 6 feet just keep that number as high as you can. And if you do have to leave and lots of people do   Just wear a mask when you go out.   Because regardless of what kinds of particles the virus can travel on whether its droplets or airborne particles -- and frankly regardless of how far it can travel on those different particles if youve got a mask on none of those particles are going anywhere. And on top of that Ed Yong says   The masks are not just a medical device theyre also a social device.   Wearing a mask he says sends a message.   I think the messages that they send depend very much on how many people are wearing them.   Okay podcast people Im going to be on your podcast.   Hey Emile help me count. How many people in here did you see wearing a mask?   I definitely saw one walk by here. So one.   If only one person is wearing a mask in a society that traditionally doesnt wear masks its very easy to think Oh thats a little weird.   Seven...   Whereas if everyone is wearing masks   Nine ten   It starts becoming more of a sign that we are all in this together we want to protect each other.   16 17 18. We count ourselves?   Yeah.   Oh. 19 20 21. I can see -- no wait 22 23. Uh lets see probably like three -- uh two-thirds or three-quarters actually.   Do you think so? Okay I think that thats good. Lets go check out.  Even if that affect is small I think that is a powerful signal..  Lets go to number 15 Hey how are you?   So from now on I think thats the number Im gonna start paying attention to.   ...I think its gonna be a little bit like that except its gonna be for kids and adults.
