  Before we begin just want to let you know this episode contains a couple moments of explicit language.     Hey this is Jad Abumrad. And today were gonna bring you an episode that we began working on about a year ago and as we were getting close to finishing everything that happened happened. The pandemic the lockdown. And for a bit we really werent sure if this was the right episode to put out in this moment. I even sent out in an email to the entire staff saying I dont think we should do this right now. But I do not know as weve been working on drafts there came a point where my thinking kind of shifted. Like oh maybe this is something we can put out into the world right now. Like maybe this is something we ought to do.   All right. Hello?   Okay so this episode took the entire staff to put together but it really began with one of our producers Rachael Cusick.   Whats happening Rachael Cusick?   Not much Jad Abumrad. Just stretching. Watching you eat a sandwich. Living life.   Im sorry. Living life?      All right.   Cool.   All right now that Ive made a mess of my sitting area so how did you -- maybe take me back to the moment you -- you -- how did you bump into this?   Okay. So I bumped into this idea because of this book that is in my hand right now. It is called Eating the Sun. And basically I got pulled into this book because I was like okay eating.   Eating.   That is pretty much all I need.  Just have that title in anything and I am like I am sold. Send me a copy.   You are the foodiest among us.   I am the foodiest. I love food so much. And so I thought this was gonna be about food. And this book comes and each page is a different musing on science. Wonky wonky. But I will just read a few Planetary Motion What is Heat? Milky Solar Galaxy System. So they are all kind of like universe-y reflections. Anyway pretty early on I am flipping these pages and on like page 17 I come across this thing with Richard Feynman and this prompt that he gave in this lecture series back in the 1960s. And I was like Wow. That is perhaps the like coolest question I have ever seen this year. Okay ready? Ready? Hold on hold on.   Wait wait. Before you do that maybe just set up like who Richard Feynman is?   Okay. So Richard Feynman this famous physicist. At the time he was like a whippersnapper of Cal Tech. I imagine there was like a soundtrack it is like Stayin' Alive Stayin' Alive every time he like walked onto campus. He was like the hotshot. I think he had ...   He was pretty attractive too.   He was! He was a handsome guy.   Yeah.   Slicked back hair. So he was famous. He had not yet won the Nobel Prize but he was like on his way to do it. He had just worked on the atomic bomb. Everyone kind of knew who he was. But at the same time he was exploding on Cal Tech's campus Cal Tech was having a problem because physics was so boring at the time. Like they could not get anyone to like come into an introductory physics class and get excited about it. So they tapped Richard Feynman to redo the physics curriculum for Physics 101. And so he was like Fine I will do it once but like that is it. You like take notes because I am done after this. And so he just like took at redefining what physics should be as an introductory thing. So I actually went and found audio of this lecture.   Oh I think I have actually seen photos of this. Black and white. He is at the front of a classroom in front of a chalkboard.   Mm-hmm.     Now typically the way that Physics 101 used to be taught ...     People spent like an entire semester of physics learning about like the history of physics.     They did not learn anything kind of like poetic.   Mm-hmm.   So Feynman before he launches into his lecture he is like ...     Look I could teach you about the history of these equations and the formulas.     But he does not. Instead ...     ... Feynman opens his entire lecture ...     ... with this question.     So that is the question.   So if the world ends and all information is gone?   But we can only pass on one sentence to the next generation.   There is a little scrap of paper fluttering in the post-apocalyptic breeze.   Yes but it has to be the least amount of words with the most amount of information. So I cannot give you like a textbook you know?   Hmm.   There has to be one thing that is concise and can unlock the universe.   Like what would you write on the paper?   Well yeah. What would you do to like pass the baton to the next generation with the simplest thing that you could possibly think up?   Oh that is such an interesting question. Did Feynman in that lecture have an answer?   Yes. He said ...     It is the atomic hypothesis ...     Period.   So this is his sentence that would be on the paper fluttering in the breeze?   Yes.   That would land in the hand of a little alien child and he would expect that to be the thing that they use to restart their civilization?   Yes. Which if you are like that little child you are like What the hell am I supposed to do with this piece of paper?   I was like So what?   I just want to know how to build a fire you know?  But the thing that I love about Feynmans answer is that once you begin to pick it apart it just begins to grow.     And grow.     I have talked to a lot of physicists this week to understand what the hell the atomic hypothesis is.   Okay.   Come with me.   Yeah please.   Okay. So let us just take it part by part. First part ...     Like ...     Everything.     The like coffeeseltzersandwich.   That I just spilled all over my ...   That you are just spilling -- yeah. You are atoms.     Atoms are the ingredients.     That is part one. Part two ...     Atoms are all moving all the time.     Thats really important because once you start to figure out that atoms are in motion you begin to figure out things like ...     Temperature.     There is also pressure.     Electricity. All these things have to do with how fast atoms are moving how many atoms are moving what parts of atoms are moving. So from there you are like a hop and a skip away from like ...     Steam engines. Telephones. The electrical grid.     Understanding flight.     Weather patterns.     So thats part two.   Okay.   Part one tells you what matter is. Part two tells you basic things about that matter. Part three ...     ... Is basically how atoms interact with each other. And once you understand that it is huge. Because in this last part is basically all of chemistry. Once you start understanding how atoms come together to make molecules you can start putting molecules together to make things like ...     Antibiotics.     Vaccines.     You can build things like a combustion engine.     Batteries. All sorts of ...     Rubbers.     Tires sneakers.     Concrete.     But also come on balloons. Or ...     You can start to understand things like proteins.     Fatty acids.     Vitamins.     To me like this is what makes this sentence so cool. Because ...     ... everything is in there. Everything you need to know about the natural world and how to manipulate it.   Hmm. But do you feel like ...   Oh sorry. Also chocolate chip cookies.  Think about a world without chocolate chip cookies. You would not know ...   Is there anything else on there because I ...   No. Chocolate cookie -- chocolate chip cookies were the big finale. I do not think you really responded properly but that was the finale. So ...   Well you know what? I am gonna take your chocolate chip cookie inspiration and follow it.   Okay. Great.   Because what is a chocolate chip cookie? It is flavor.   Mm-hmm.   Which I am sure we could sort of reduce to nothing but the sparking of electrons on a certain membrane in the tongue or something. But really what chocolate chip cookies are I hope you will agree is the -- that momentary ecstatic feeling you feel.   Mm-hmm.   And the sense of joy and well-being and then the subsequent crash right?   Yes.   So all of these things are -- do you feel like they are reducible to atoms?   Yes.   Do you feel like love is explained by the atomic hypothesis? Do you feel like the complexities of human interactions ...   No.   Morality?   No. That is where it falls short. Everything that is physical in our world can be described by atoms. But like music? Like you cannot look at the atomic hypothesis and create like Mozart.   Right.   Or you cannot like learn how to be a good partner with the atomic hypothesis you know?   Right.   Like there are these big gaps that you just are missing.   I think that -- and thus a door opens.   Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.    Do not you want to hear -- dont you wanna hear the -- a musician answer -- do Feynman's exercise?   Mm-hmm.   Or -- I suddenly want to hear who is the sort of great philosopher of chocolate chip cookies?   And so ...   Cue music.   Yeah what is the music for a cataclysm?   I do not know. I mean it is ...   Is it really loud? Or is it a little like dust bowl and it is quiet you know?   I think it starts small like a tone. And then it is two tones and then it is more. And then it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and it expands. And it feels kind of primal but also hopeful maybe? I do not know.   As you were talking that did remind me of a thought that I had when I came across this in the very first place because it does -- when I -- I think I came across it like a year ago when I was feeling like everyone -- like the political conversation was just especially -- what is the word when you think like the sky is falling? Like Chicken Little-esque. Where it is like everything is falling apart like everything ...   Apocalyptic?   Yes. It felt like everyone felt doomed. And I was like if the world actually was falling apart around us what would be the only thing that we have to show for it? Like what is a way to like bring what Feynman thought back in the '60s and bring it to today when it does kind of feel like everyone thinks the sky is falling?   Yeah.   I should just say quick the two of us had this conversation many months ago back when the world was a very different place.   How does it resonate? I mean tell me a little bit more how does it resonate with you personally?   I mean this is coming from a place that I think I am like pretty lucky to have this thought because I am definitely like very lucky in a lot of ways. But like I think I am just like a hopeful person. And I often like love spending time with older people in my family and like feeling like before they go I need to get like whatever wisdom they have because like once they are gone it is gone you know? And so when I think about that I am like I just want to like pull all the goodness out before like something goes wrong.   Yeah.   And preserve it.   Whose brain -- who are you talking about? Whose brains for you personally are you trying to do that with?   I mean I think about it -- I was talking to my friend and they were like Why do you only hang out with old people? Because I was just like -- I think most people -- like even if -- because Im 24. But like someone whos 30 I think they have seen more of the world than I have. And I would rather spend time with someone whos ...   Oh my God your 24-year-old friends are talking about 30-year-olds as if theyre old people?   Well I mean a lot of my like young friends like dont want to look towards older people because they think like this is a mess and like we are the future and we need to do this. And I totally agree with that in a lot of ways but I also think like why start from scratch if there could be something pulled out of the dumpster that like might be helpful? And so like my grandma -- like my grandma and I shes like the most important person to me in the world. So thats like one person. But like every like -- like you or like Robert. Or like old people.   Old people. Thanks. Thats fine. Ill -- I will take on that moniker. What do you -- I mean none of my business but Im suddenly curious to know what kinds of questions -- do you sit with your grandma and you ask her just general questions or do you have more specific things you wonder about with someone of her age?   Well like its pretty -- like I -- so my mom died when I was six and so like one thing that seems to motivate I think a lot of that curiosity is like my older siblings -- I was the youngest of -- the youngest of five who lost her. And they all have these like very concrete memories that like when I think about it its like I arrived on the scene right after she left the scene. Like when my memory finally started to kick in its like right when she left.   Do you remember anything about her?   There are a few memories I know for sure are mine. And then after those few like I think on one hand I can count the ones I know are mine. And so a lot of the times when they talk about these things like these birthday parties that she used to throw or like her laugh or the like music shed play in the minivan I like -- I dont actually remember any of those things for myself.   I mean how do you fill that then? Do you talk to your -- do you try and just ply anecdotes from your older siblings?   I dont know. Like some of it I feel like a little sad that I have to ask for those things. And so sometimes I just hang back and let them talk. And then I feel a little bit jealous but then I also do go searching for them like sometimes with my grandma. Like I call my grandma once a week. And like she told me this one story the other day that I just thought was so funny. Like it was this sense of humor of my mom that I like didnt even know existed. And that just felt so -- it was just like meeting a different side of her that I had no idea was there.   Yeah.   But it was just this like little angle of like a diamond gem you know? Like theres some little surface that like I just felt my thumb go over and I never knew it was there. And like I dont know. I just kind of want to feel all the textures.   Yeah.   And like memories of people because I know how easily they just go away.   Yeah.   I think I like walk through the world collecting things. Like I am like a little stick collector. Like I want to like collect all the sticks I can. Because I know what it feels like to feel like empty-handed.   So what began as that conversation with Rachael about the cataclysm sentence and what could you give -- what is the simplest thing you could pass forward for the next person to hold onto well what happened is that really as a staff we got interested in the idea. Kind of got fixated on it actually. And so what we did ...     We started calling people.   Hello?   Hello is this Mr. Nick Baker?   This is indeed. Hang on one second.   Dozens ...   Hello hello can you hear me?   Yes I can hear you.   ... and dozens of people.   Hello Merrill?   Yeah.   Artists writers philosophers historians chefs musicians.   So I sent you an email.   And we asked them ...   That asked you a question.   Feynman's question. If hypothetically the world were to end and everything was lost all our knowledge gone what would be the most important information in the least number of words that you would convey to the next set of people? What would be your sentence? We are gonna play you a bunch of the answers that we got. We cannot play all of them because that would take four hours so we are just gonna play you a selection. Starting with ...   For me it is something like you will die and that is the most important thing.   Writer mortician Caitlin Doughty.   And I think most people get that. I think most people get that they are gonna die but I do not think what most people get is that the fact that they are going to die is the most important thing that will ever happen to them. Humans are one of the few creatures that understand death and understand -- live -- live their whole lives with the knowledge of their deaths. And so it is this conflict within us. We live in these shitty decaying bodies but we feel so special and we feel so important. So how do you reconcile those two things? It is hard to reconcile them so you have to create you have to transcend. You have to have religion you have to have communities you have to have art. Those are created by our -- our fear and our strange difficult weird relationship with death.   Okay. Oh so let us talk about fear.   Esperanza Spalding. Musician and wolf enthusiast.   Okay here we go. Here's your parallel from the ecosystem. When wolves were reintroduced to Yellowstone Park at first the thinking was we are just doing this because we do not fully understand yet all the ways that this species is important but we know that it is and it is been absent and we finally have this opportunity to reintroduce them into Yellowstone. So of course all the biologists were studying this like crazy conservation biologists. And the first thing that happened was all the game who had not been subjected to any threats they were -- they were at the top of the food chain. All of a sudden they all became more alert and more responsive. And they stopped grazing constantly in the exact same part of the river. They had to move more because now there was this like threat of the wolf.   So what happened is they start moving more they start grazing higher up in the hills where they are less likely to be just you know picked off in these low grasslands. So what happens is the banks of the riverbank get firmer which means the flow of the river becomes stronger which means beavers can come in and start to build their dams. Also because the -- the game is not grazing in the same area trees that previously had been chewed up in their early sapling stages start growing. So songbirds return. All these species of -- of bird come back into Yellowstone that had been absent because it did not have the right canopy cover. And because the beavers come in that creates more pocket environments for other animals and that brings in more big predators who are eating what the beavers are attracting. So basically this one species who had become dominant and very comfortable and at the top of their food chain just the presence of them having to confront regularly and respond creatively to a little fear completely changed the health and the landscape and the sustainability of the ecosystem. So maybe it is like -- maybe it is like just that The willingness to respond creatively to fear without trying to eradicate the source of the fear.   My name is Cord Jefferson and I am a television writer and producer. Okay I wrote down a bunch of different things that I then erased and then I sort of settled on one that I thought was definitely going to be my thing which was about race and racism. And I -- like I had that sentence all prepared which was Race is not real unless you make it real at which point it will become the biggest problem in the whole world. And then I started thinking that you know what is -- what is sort of even bigger than racism? And to me like even bigger than racism is just general fear. And my personal history is that my -- my mother is a -- a white woman who married my father who is a black man and they disowned her. And so I -- I never -- never met my grandparents. I would -- I would send them letters which they would return until I stopped sending them when I was -- I think when I was about 10 or 11. And I just -- and I saw how much that devastated my mother and how much it sort of ripped her family apart and it sort of estranged her from her brother for a while. And it was -- yeah it was just sort of in a way that I remember thinking like this is -- this is so pointless. Like it is just so stupid. Like I remember -- I remember think -- thinking like what could anybody in my family do to -- that would make me you know hate them forever? And it is like you know the skin color was -- was just so insignificant to me.   And I think that fear shapes everything from geopolitics to just even people's unwillingness to try new things and to go new places and to travel and to -- to ski and to go out and meet people. And it causes so much conflict and it causes so much aggression and hate that I think that you know I -- I believe sort of racism is wrapped up in that but fear I think is -- is our -- our bigger problem.      My sentence is ...      The only things you are innately afraid of are falling and loud noises. The rest of your fears are learned and mostly negligible.   Merrill Garbus. I lead a band called Tune-Yards. Fear is very -- what is that word? Compelling as a motivation. It is very essential to who we are and it makes a lot of sense because we did have to run from things. We needed to be vigilant and if we were not then we died. But I do think that it is a choice. So I thought wanting to communicate as much as possible with this one sentence that it would be good to sing the sentence.    Evolving over millennia. We learn to fly. We are nourished by the fruits of the Earth. Inspired by each other's music. But we failed as a species. Injured the very hands that fed us when we chose fear as our ruler. When we could not grasp being mere fractals in one collective being. In the end there was no we.   It reminds me of this thing called Do nothing farming that a Japanese farmer named Masanobu Fukuoka came up with. And he kind of went against all of the established customs of rice farming in Japan and decided to just kind of like pay attention to how things work without any intervention. So he said that he was inspired by an empty lot full of grasses and weeds and how productive that actually was. And so he went about farming without flooding the fields. He just threw the seeds on the ground kind of when they would naturally fall on the ground in the fall. He didnt use fertilizer he just grew kind of ground cover. And then he threw the stalks back on top when he was done. And he just kind of had to do everything at exactly the right time that it would happen naturally. But this farm was more productive and more sustainable than neighboring farms. All of human effort is meaningless as he puts it. So he says humanity knows nothing at all. Theres no intrinsic value in anything and every action is a futile meaningless effort.   Writer Jenny Odell. And now ...   Here we go.   Writer Maria Popova.   We are each allotted a sliver of space-time wedged between not yet and no more which we fill with the lifetime of joys and sorrows immensities of thought and feeling all deducible to electrical impulses coursing through us at 80 feet per second yet responsible for every love poem that has ever been written every symphony ever composed every scientific breakthrough measuring out nerve conduction and mapping out space-time. I mean its astonishing that were not you know spending every day in marvel at the improbability that we even exist. You know somehow we -- we went from bacteria to Bach. We -- we learned to make fire and music and mathematics and here we are now these -- these walking wildernesses of mossy feelings and brambled thoughts beneath this overstory of 100 trillion synapses that are just coruscating with these restless questions.   Why?   Professor Alison Gopnick.   My sentence would be single word Why?   I would want to show that we loved it here you know?   Animator Rebecca Sugar.   We have you know evidence from Pompeii.     We have all of these physical examples ...     That humans have loved being here.     That were having a great time.  So that may be the greatest message a person could leave is to just ...     ... leave behind some record of how you were living.     You know leave behind your nest and evidence of how you were in it with the people that you loved.     Maybe that will be the thing to leave is you know some evidence of my nest.     And maybe the ultimate goal would be to just devote oneself fully to creating the life that feels the best on this world in the time that we have.     But actually I think the greatest thing to come out of the ruins of Pompeii is that they had toilet stalls where two people could sit together next to one another so you can have a conversation. Its a fabulous idea. Why did we not learn from this? Why are we wasting time that we could be spending with our friends? Why are we wasting that time?   All right bathroom break. We will be back in a sec.   Jad. Radiolab. And we are back asking people if the world were to end what is the one sentence they would leave behind? Or the one sentence with the most amount of information fewest number of words?   Tell me what is it that Feynman says again?   We pick back up with writer Nicholson Baker.   Oh God.   Okay yeah. Here we are. Here we are. Okay.   And producer Simon Adler.   All things are made of atoms - little particles that move around in perpetual motion attracting each other when they are a little distance apart but repelling upon being squeezed into one another.   I like it. I mean I think its got a certain lilt. But think if you -- there was -- the cataclysm happened and the creature that inherited the Earth was a super-intelligent form of seal. You know there -- there is beaches and theyre just covered with these seals and theyre still making those strange seal noises but theyre actually intensely verbal creatures. And somehow some particular seal gets this thing that comes zapping down from the sky which is a -- which is a voice from the deep past or the recorded essence of brilliant scientific knowledge which is All things are made of little things and they -- and they push against each other and they -- sometimes they push back when they squeeze. Well what is that very bright seal going to do? I mean what -- what is that -- how -- its gonna help them more quickly invent an atomic bomb but is that where -- is that where we want the seals to go really fast? No. We want them to -- look theyre busy figuring out how to better get around the beach get along with each other maybe build some kind of nice slide so they can zoom down and fly off and have some fun. Theres a lot these bright seals can do. They have a big future ahead of them.   So what I would substitute is something that would maybe help them that was very helpful to me which is that -- that you know more than you can say. Its a -- its a crisp way of saying that language is great. And -- and you know Im in the language business and I try to create sentences that are momentarily diverting and all that but language is a tiny tiny part of the knowledge that we actually have. And not just because theres musical knowledge and the knowledge of colors and fragrances and other things that are inarticulable but because the knack of knowing how to put words together the knack of knowing how to say in a condensed form a truth is something that involves a feel a nimbleness a sort of -- a set of dance moves that nobody no matter how good you are at slinging sentences nobody can articulate step by step backwards into this world the under-structure of what allowed him or her to say this thing that involved words. So look at what is around you and see who knows how to do things and then learn from that. And the way the person describes how he does things may actually be completely inadequate. Youre gonna have to watch. We know more than we can say. That I think is the most useful piece of scientific helpfulness I guess that you could give.   The moon revolves around the Earth which is not the center of the universe far from it. But just one of many objects large and small that revolve around the sun which in turn is one of countless stars mostly so far away that theyre invisible even on the clearest night. All traveling through space on paths obeying simple laws of nature that can be expressed in terms of mathematics. Oh and by the way there is no God.      Writer James Gleick. And up next is the artist Lady Pink.   Okay. So I would like to say God is a female. And I would also love to leave behind a mural something like one of Michelangelo's awesome depictions of God coming in and a you know grandiose and glorious and absolutely gigantic mural but as a female. And I think I would like to do her as one of the gray aliens. Do you know what I mean? One of the -- the big-eyed aliens with those big big heads and those big bug eyes like that with real sexy lips and a little bit of eye lashes? With kind of looking like the Virgin Mary or the Virgin de Guadalupe wearing the long gown and the blue veil thing and you know holding her hand up and a -- and a little bleeding heart with worshipers at her feet and -- because she would be so gigantic three four stories. Thats like at least like 40 feet 30 feet. You know very large figure. She would be looking down at you.       I would say that a lot of my childhood I was thinking a lot about surviving the apocalypse. You know how could I do that? How could I be good enough?   Writer Jenny Hollowell.   I liked the texture of life. I liked the idea of being in the back of the station wagon and driving down the street and seeing my neighbors mowing their lawns or riding their bicycles. And the idea that they would all disappear or be -- not be survivors of whatever that apocalyptic event might be was just jolting. I was also selfishly along the way hoping that I could maybe get past certain thresholds so that I could experience them before they were gone like being able to drive. Because I really wasnt sure whether cars were gonna be around later so -- I remember really hoping that I could make it to middle school so that I could have a locker because I thought lockers were really cool. I just thought like Okay if I can have a locker and then later drive then those two things -- like if we can just get past those things then Ill be a little more relieved to see the end come. Maybe. Everything is connected. To me that feels like a sentence that contains an element of scientific truth but also inspires us to believe in it. Because I do think that whatever we leave behind needs to contain something about it that would inspire the finder of it to believe in it.   Okay up next.   Hello.   Hello can you hear me?   Yeah.   Hey!   Can you hear me?   Yes I can.   We bring back Rachael Cusick. So you and producer Jeremy Bloom talked to someone.   Mm-hmm.   Hi Rachael.   We talked to this guy Jaron Lanier.   Do you want to know anything about me or is the name enough?   I would love to know about you. Give us -- give us a fun fact.   So Jaron ...   I am a computer scientist.   He is basically like the godfather of virtual reality and was pretty instrumental in getting the internet off the ground.   Oh!   I also write books and I also play music and most notably on a large variety of very unusual musical instruments.   Do you have any instruments near you right now?   Oh a couple thousand.            So this -- this whole project is like reach out to people you find inspiring and asking them if they have any inspiring things to say.   Right.   And the reason we reached out to Jaron is because he helped create these huge advances in technology. But the other reason we talked to him is because he actually knew Richard Feynman.   Really? How did he know him?   Well so ...   How honest do you want this to be?   I want it to be as honest as you want it to be.   Well ...   He said this was back in the late '70s.   I was 16 or 17.   Living in New Mexico.   And what happened is my first serious girlfriend was someone I met over a summer.   She was visiting from California.   And I followed her back to California where it turns out her dad was the head of the physics department at Cal Tech. And after a while she dumped me and there I was.   Oh no!   What was I to do? I am still there. And so I just hung out more and more with people in the physics department.   Do you remember where you were when you first saw Richard Feynman?   Sure. I was being walked down a hallway by my friend Cynthia and he was in there explaining something to a small class of people with his hands primarily. He talked with his hands a lot. And -- and she said There is the famous Feynman. And of course my very first thought is Oh damn. He is like the smartest person alive. And he is also handsome and he is happy and he is graceful. Like fuck him. Oh I cannot say that on the radio. I am sorry.   You can say it.   Like I was like Oh my God this guy's just -- like it is not fair. This guy just has too much going for him.   But Jaron says as he got to know him ...   He was just fun and funny.   The two of them would talk about physics and just about life.   He played percussion. He played drums.   They would play music together.   Which was great. His -- his primary approach to life was to seek joy.   Do you remember him asking you about cataclysms ever?   I -- I definitely remember that topic and that conversation because remember in those days we were in the thick of the Cold War.     And in school you were trained to hide under your desk in case there would be a nuclear you know attack and -- which of course everyone knew would be a futile gesture. And so this question it was like a little glimmer of hope like in the face of absolute annihilation where hiding under your desk will not help where hiding in some basement will not help where you will not survive this is at least -- it is applying imagination towards what you possibly could do. Maybe you could leave a message for the future.   We talked for a while about how much Jaron really loved this question because like he and Feynman and these other physicists they would hang out and kind of talk about this question for hours. And they would debate about what was the best thing to write down on this piece of paper. Partially because it was fun but also because it felt important to have an answer. But then when we asked him what would he now would write down as his cataclysm sentence ...   You personally Jaron what would you do?   Wow.   He took a deep breath. And then said ...   I would give them nothing.   Huh. Like nothing nothing?   Zilch.   Does he mean like the paper fluttering in the breeze that lands in the hand of the next person it would have nothing written on it?   He means like there is just no piece of paper at all.   Yeah.   That seems kind of sad to me. Like why wouldnt you want to leave them something?   Well ...   What is that?   Lets see.   Jaron's like lets just say you do leave behind a sentence about ...   The basics of math and physics.   Or ...   Agriculture and medicine.   Or some sentence about biology or public health.   That sort of thing. Its redundant. Like all of that kind of information is just the stuff that is out there waiting to be discovered in nature anyway so we do not have to do anything. If people apply themselves they will rediscover all that stuff. So it is not like we are special. Letting them get it in their own good time might be better for them so what have we actually added? Perhaps weve only taken away.   Taken away because giving some highly-evolved science fact kind of scared him because Jaron thinks like you never really know how those are gonna unfurl in another world. I mean look at Feynmans sentence. It gave us all of these cool things that we talked about up at the beginning but it also gave us ...     I mean Feynman and others in his generation whod come of age working in the Manhattan Project were put in an absolutely impossible moral puzzle where bringing the war to an end decisively was a great good and the other side in the war had been the darkest evil. All of that was clear and yet in the big picture it was just impossible to know if they would done the right thing. And that cloud of doubt still hangs over science today.   For example Jaron says ...   Like I was very involved in the birth of the internet.   Look at the internet. That started as this amazing gift to people so that we could connect in this way that we never had before but as we now know ...   It spreads disinformation. Theres every economic incentive to be terrible. And the incentives to be decent are far far weaker. And I still have these incredible feelings of guilt and uncertainty about whether we just screwed things up terribly in a way that might take centuries or millennia to fix or something. Like theres just this haunting -- this feeling of like oh my God what have we done was it the right thing?   So we suggested like what if it was not a piece of science but like a piece of wisdom? Something you would kind of like find inside of a fortune cookie?   Well that becomes a very interesting exercise. And what you realize is whatever little words of wisdom you can pass along because the whole terms of the game is that theyll be isolated theyll take on this outsized preciousness. They wont be surrounded by context. And almost anything you can say will become distorted and somewhat useless if its overemphasized in that way. Which is to say nothing we could do is helpful. Let us just lay back. Let us be modest. Let us ...   What if you were on the other side of that? Like what if you were on the other side of the cataclysm and you discover that you are not gonna get anything at all?   Well I mean if -- if there is nothing given how would I even know that there was nothing given? I do not think I would even be aware that there was something to have feelings about.   That is fair.   I do not know. I feel like sometimes when you like walk into like an empty field or something like you are looking for something if you are kind of feeling lost.   Okay so there is people in the future and they find our ruins and then there is some big plaque that says We have decided to leave you no information. You will learn nothing of us. If -- these next people might turn out to be wiser than us. Or if they do not and they extinguish themselves then the next generation after that. At some point if some kind of cycle of cataclysm and civilization continues at some point there'ill be some civilization that is wiser than us and will not annihilate itself and let us just not screw with these people. Let us just give them a chance to come about naturally and they will eventually.   But that is an optimistic viewpoint too. Like if we seem to keep like exploding ourselves how do you have faith that we will get there ever?   Just because of the reality of randomness.    What does that mean?      I love that phrase but I have no idea what it means.   It is a little bit -- it is like a version of evolution. Like let us just assume that there is not just gonna be one cataclysm and another cycle but we will keep on going through these things until just through the grace of randomness we get some civilization that comes up that is got its act together enough to not have another cataclysm. And I think there is something to be said for that. It is like some kind of faith in the far future that we will finally get it together.   So that was basically his answer. Like say nothing. Have faith. Trust the math. But ...   If you today had to go back to you as a kid ...   We kept pushing him.   Uh-huh.   Would you have a specific sentence that you would share with a younger you?   Oh gosh.   And each time ...   Is there a sentence that you would say to start us in a more optimistic light?   He pretty much didnt budge.    No I just ...   Except when Jeremy asked him this one question.   if you could leave music for the next society would you?   Wow. That is a really interesting question. So you know one of the things about music is that it is an incredibly important part of our lives. It is part of every time we have a wedding or a funeral. It is incredibly important to us and yet until very recently with the appearance of recording technologies it was lost generation to generation. I play all these weird instruments ...   He demonstrated for us.   Theres a kind of flute played by the Sami people sort of like the Eskimos of Finland.   And part of it is this feeling of being able to at least move and breathe like people did in the past.   This is an instrument from Laos.   So you get a little bit of connection with them. But of course you do not really know.   This is a contrabass flute.   If you could leave an instrument for the next society that maybe could say something about our society would you?   That was called a tarhu.   I dont know. Thats a very hard question.   This is a kind of Turkish clarinet.   Id have to think about that one a lot. I think Id ...   The oud a Middle Eastern instrument.   ... possibly choose the piano I hate to say.  Why the piano?   The reason the piano fascinates me is its kind of a digital button box like a computer but it transcends being a button box. Because on a piano you hit the key and then you send this hammer flying and the only thing you can tell the hammer is how fast to fly. So you would think it shouldnt be very expressive and yet different pianists sit down and have touches on it that are distinguished. I believe there is a bit of a mystery left there.   Okay to round things out it just so happened that somebody that I had really wanted to talk to for this episode ...   Hi! Long time no see!   I know!   How are you?   ... is a composer who plays the piano.   You are like everywhere this month.   Her name is Missy Mazzouli. She is very busy at the moment. She has two operas opening pretty much at the same time. Her work's been performed by orchestras all over the world. And we asked her to come down to our station at WNYC where we have a piano.   Do you want water or anything?   Yeah you -- he was gonna get me water.   Okay great.   Also a Rachael.   Okay.   Because you know going back to the whole conceit of this thing one of the questions that I had at the very start of this was if we gave this Feynman cataclysm sentence challenge to a musician what would happen?   We can start talking just in a -- in a -- in a -- yeah let us -- we can just start.   Ooh!   So -- so you -- you came up with a musical answer to this question.   Yeah. I call it the primordial chord.   Oh cool!   Is my name for it.   Oh thats cool!   So going along with this idea of setting you know Humans 2.0 or the next version of creatures up for a better existence I wanted to create something that would point them in that direction. So I wanted -- there is a couple things about this chord that I hope will do that. So this is a chord that has to be played by three people. You cannot play this chord by yourself unless you have six arms which maybe these creatures will have. But you know you need three people to play it.   And why did you pick three people?   That is a good question. I think that is what I felt could fit at a piano.   Mmm.   And so -- and I -- and I chose the piano because it is generally the biggest instrument that we have general access to in New York City right now. And I wanted it to -- and it has the biggest range of musical instruments that we use every day. There is certain -- there is music that is maybe higher and lower but in general like most music you hear in the world fits into the range of a piano. So this chord encompasses the whole range of the piano. We use the lowest note we use the highest note and it also has all 12 notes of the Western chromatic scale in it.   Oh interesting.   And there -- also ...   That is gonna sound like chaos!   It is not though!      This is -- it is ordered. It is -- I have ordered it so that -- so that it hopefully does not sound like chaos. Anything could happen. I do not know.   I so want to hear it now.   I know!   So do I!   Should we do it?   Can we play it?   Is it -- let us go do it.   So we had to get up and go over to the studio where the piano is.   Okay so we are here in CR-5 or as -- as -- as we like to think of it John Schaefer's studio. There is the big grand piano to our left. We are gonna follow your lead here Missy.   Okay.   Okay.   So Missy pulled out the sheet music.   This is the primordial chord.    Oh my God. Okay.   So if you imagine a page of orchestral score we have all probably seen one at some point. You have got the lines running horizontally across the page. The page was mostly blank except for ...   One two three four ...   And it looks insane.   ... five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen notes.   Yes.   You got 13 little circles all stacked up in a vertical line looking kind of like a rocket about to take off.   And you have three clefs. So it is -- each one is one -- one human.   Yes. So each -- each grand staff is one human being playing one piano.   Ooh!   Okay. Ho long did it take you to come up with this?   It took me a shockingly long time.       Because I kept fiddling around with it playing with the resonance. You know sometimes I would come up with something and feel -- I felt that it was too dissonant.   Hmm.   It is also a challenge to come up with a chord that includes all 12 of these notes you know? So like  -- so all 12 of those spread out over this huge range that still has a sort of you know consonant feeling to it.   It is interesting. When you look at the chord this giant chord which contains all the notes in a scale she is arranged it so that you can see in the chord all of these kind of musical molecules. Like oh those three notes in hand number four that is a major triad. And these two notes in the bass that is a tritone interval. And then okay ooh look at that! In the upper register that is a diminished chord. And if these words do not mean anything to you it is fine. The point is is if you zoom into this chord you see all of these harmonic universes ready to spill out. That is why she calls it the primordial chord.   Should we do it?   Let us do it.   Yeah.   We can sit down maybe.   Okay.   Okay.   Is that okay?   Yeah. Well you sit and then -- and then maybe Rachael and I will get like half a cheek.   A half buttock yeah. Together we will be a whole butt.    So Missy sat in the center of the piano bench I was sort of hanging off the left side half a cheek. Rachael was hanging off the right side half a cheek.   Okay.   Cool.   Perfect. So far so good. Okay so Jad ...   Yes.   I am gonna set you up. So I am gonna just play it for you. These are your four notes.   Love it. Okay.   Okay? Perfect. Perfect. And then these are your -- you have five notes.   Okay.   One two three four five.   Okay. I am gonna have to like ...   He -- is he rolling over there? Okay.   It sounds pretty good here.   Okay. Yeah.   So we will just build it low to high.   Okay. Should we build it sequentially or do we want to try like a ...   Oh let us try all together first.   Okay.   Try all together first and then we will build low to high.   So let us see if we can ...   Okay.   So there is like an upbeat and then there is one two three four ...   Hit.   Okay?    One two three four.      Is not that -- I do not know. It just keeps going.    Yeah.   It never stops.   Maybe forever.       What if we have to go to the bathroom?    God this is it. This is -- welcome to the rest of your life. Just stuck here holding this chord on the piano.    I am afraid to let go now.   This is a big responsibility. The weight of the world is on that pinkie.   Alrighty and ...      That was awesome guys!   So cool!   That was so good!   Oh my God!   That was so great.   I am so proud of you.   It feels like the end of a movie that -- that feeling.   It really does. I feel like I got the best part. I got the bass it just like -- everything I do sounds good down here.   See I like mine up here. It is really nice.   See I feel totally safe between the two of you just like hanging out in the middle.   I feel like I am the foundation of this new society.   Yeah but I give us hope.    I am the glue. See? We all need each other. That is the point.   It is. It is like a full human being.   What if we can play it as quiet as possible?  Because we are humble. Our next humans are humble. Ready? One two three.     This episode was assembled by the entire Radiolab team. It was borne out of the wondrous brain of Rachael Cusick and it was produced by -- I am just gonna let him read the credits with me by Mr. Matt Kielty.   We had original music in this episode from Alex Overington. Our fact-checker was Diane Kelly. Special thanks and there is a few our friends over at Nancy producers Zakia Gibbons and Jeremy Bloom. Also Ella Frances Sanders and her book Eating the Sun for kicking this whole episode off. Cal Tech for letting us use original audio of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. The entirety of the lectures are available to read for free online at www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu.   I also want to thank -- this is Jad again -- all of the musicians from all over the world who after the pandemic set in they recorded themselves in their homes sent us the audio and Alex used that to make the giant primordial chord you just heard. Their names are ...   Koosha Pashangpour from Iran.   Claire James Boston Massachusetts.   Solmaz Badri Iran.   Liav Kerbel and I am currently living in Belgium.   Amelia Watkins Saint-Sauveur Quebec.   Matthias Marcus Kowalczyk Germany.   Hi I am Curtis MacDonald and I am from Canada.   Ilario Morciano Northeast Italy.   Bryan Harris Richmond Virginia.   Saskia Lankhoorn The Hague The Netherlands.   This is Meade Bernard from Brooklyn New York.   Also thanks to three musicians who did not ID themselves Sam Crittenden in Brooklyn Barnaby Rea in the UK and Siavash Kamkar in Iran.   Before we go one more thing. Next week we have a kind of part two to this episode. It is reported by Simon Adler kind of in the same spirit. Less about what you would pass on and more about what you would cling to. That is next week. 'Til then I am Jad Abumrad. This has been Radiolab. Thank you for listening.    Copyright  2019 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved.
