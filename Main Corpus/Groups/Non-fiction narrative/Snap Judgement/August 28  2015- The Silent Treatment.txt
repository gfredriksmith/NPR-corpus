 In second grade my teacher never called me stupid or dumb or slow but when I returned the book assigned to me that morning and told her that I had finished it could I please choose another she stared back over her soulful-rimmed glasses and hissed liar. In third grade a man wearing a thin brown tie came into our classroom and said that according to his assessment a select few of us would be asked to take a special test to determine if we were gifted. He called seven names. I watched all of them get up from their seats and leave the room. In fourth grade after a boy kicked me the principal demanded that I deliver a letter to my parents that explained I was suspended from school for agitating violence. In fifth grade the lady told me that the c-a-t and d-o-g could run. Would I mind writing cat and dog on the board? Do not worry if you spell it wrong. You just do the best you can. In sixth grade on the first day of class a lady turned my chair to face the wall. The other students' chairs faced the teacher. And so it remained for the rest of the year. You see they never called me anything. They never said a word. The problem of course was that I did not say anything either.
