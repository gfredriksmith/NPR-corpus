 OK so I had a friend right and she started doing the books for her father's business. And things - they were not adding up. For some reason a check was sent every month to an address she did not know about. So she decided to investigate - drove out to the place knocked on the door - a little girl answered. Hello? May I help you? My friend was shocked because this little girl looked exactly like her. Yeah daddy had a secret family. And it made my friend wonder who was that guy she would been calling daddy? Who was he? Who was the guy sitting down at dinner every night? Who was the guy tucking her into bed? Was that guy a stranger? Sometimes the person we think we know best we do not know at all. Today we are going to explore that mysterious other the person we do not really know. From PRX and NPR SNAP JUDGMENT proudly presents The Stranger. Get ready to pull back the curtain. My name is Glynn Washington and this is SNAP JUDGMENT.
