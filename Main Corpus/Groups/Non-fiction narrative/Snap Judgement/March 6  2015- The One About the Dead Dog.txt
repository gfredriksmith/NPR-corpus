SNAP JUDGMENT.    So my boss asked me to watch her dog while she and her family go on vacation.   OK well I would not do that but...    Yeah no I love dogs so this was no problem for me.   So what kind of dog was it?   A golden retriever.   Oh yeah those are great dogs.   Yeah.   .   So one day I go in I check on the dog and the dog was dead.   Excuse me?   He is not moving and I do not really know what to do. I tried... So I called my boss. Actually I did not. I called her husband. My boss would crucify me.   OK.   OK Sam Sam it is not your fault.   I am really sorry. I do not know what happened...   Hey get out of the water Cheryl .   ...But he is not moving.   Just a second. No do not dunk. Do not dunk him under.   I am really sorry to be interrupting.   Just take him to the vet OK? And just tell them that he is ours and they will know what to do OK? I cannot talk anymore.   I cannot - I cannot - I do not...   Just do that OK?   Take him to the vet...   Take him the vet. The phone number's on the fridge.   So I stuffed Mexico  into a suitcase.   Into a suitcase?   Believe me this was not fun.   Oh no. My god no.   I loved this dog.   No of course you do of course.   I love all dogs.   Yeah.   It was so heavy. I mean it weighed as much as a golden retriever weighs...   Full-grown golden retriever.   Yeah so it was very heavy. And I get him onto the subway.   Whoa hang on you did not call a cab?    I know. Well thinking back like yeah but the car is pretty empty...   Uh huh good for you.   ...Except for there is this one guy.   Oh my god.   And he is staring at the suitcase.   Looks heavy.   What? Excuse...   Your suitcase it looks heavy.   He was staring at it so hard that I thought he knew what was inside of it.   What you got in there?   Speakers.   Yeah must be some heavy-duty speakers.   And he gets up and he walks across the car and he sits right next to me.   He sits next to you?   Yes which...   Oh man.   ...You do not do that.   No.   What kind of speakers are they?   And he starts asking me what kind of speakers? And where are you going with them?   Where are you going with speakers like that?   And then finally we get to Union Square and I am like this is me bye.   No way this is my stop too.   Oh cool bye.   Let me give you a hand with those.   No I got it.   No come on. I cannot let a lady carry something this heavy.   No I got it. I got it this far. I can take it. Thank you though.   We are friends now come on.   OK yeah. So before I know it he is carrying the suitcase.   I cannot believe you have speakers in this thing.   Yeah. I am kind of relieved because it is heavy.   And maybe he is just a good guy.   Yeah maybe he is just a good guy. But once we start walking up the steps... No wait. He just takes off running. Wait where are you going?   What?   Yeah he takes off running. I tried to run after him but he runs away with the suitcase.   Jesus.   Yeah.   What'd you do? How did you get it back?   I did not. I did not get it back. I never saw him or it again.   Oh my god.   Yeah yeah.   Wow that is crazy.   I know. I know .   She stuffs the dog into the suitcase.   Come on.    So...   God.   Are you listening?   Yeah yeah yeah.   So she is got this dead dog on the subway...   Uh huh.   ...In the suitcase...   Yep.   ...And this guy starts staring at her.   OK.   He comes over sits next to her. He is like what is in the suitcase?   What is in the suitcase right?   Yeah.   And then he - and then he - she says it is electronics.   Speakers. She says speakers but yeah that is close.   And then he steals it from her right? And then he runs away?   Yeah yeah actually that is exactly what happened. How did you know?   This did not happen.   What do you mean it did not happen?   It is an urban legend.   Sam told me this story. It happened to her.   I mean if you do not believe me you can go look it up on the computer.    Well OK but this is completely different. See it says she was asked to dog-sit for a Great Dane and this was a golden retriever.   No look the man offered to carry the suitcase for her. She said no thank you but the man grabbed the suitcase anyway and ran up the stairs with it never to be seen again.   Weird.   Maybe she was just trying to impress you.   It could be coincidence. You have never been here before? Not as a kid?   I have never been here.   Yeah you should come to one of the lectures they do here.   Oh that would be great.   It is like a whole show in the planetarium.   They have a planetarium?   Yeah they got a planetarium. It is like...   Oh my God.   Yeah I am really into space stuff so...   Oh yeah? Well when I was a kid a piece of a satellite landed in my backyard.   Wow.   It was nuts.   You know what else? They have a spider exhibit upstairs. We can go check that out.   Oh no.   No do not make that face. Hang out.   No I do not do spiders.   You do not do spiders?   No.   Not even the ones that can sting you and give you seizures?   Especially those. No honestly I had a really bad experience with a spider once and I just - ugh.   What happened?   Well a few years ago I was in Bali. And I had this lump on my arm. And it would not go away so I went to the doctor there. And when he cut it open hundreds of baby spiders crawled out.   Huh. I guess that happens to people even though it is incredibly unlikely.   Oh god. It was disgusting.   Actually I have heard that story. It is a really famous story. It is all over the Internet. This guy was in Bali and he had a lump on his arm.   It must be a Bali thing then.   I do not think it is.   God it was horrible.   You never heard this story? It is a really famous story.   No.   It is an urban legend. It was a really big story. It was an urban legend.   I am sorry I - are you...   I am just saying if it did not happen to you...   What?   ...You know then just say it just say it did not happen to me.   You think I am lying to you?   Well...   I am not making this up.   Well can I show you something? This - do you remember that dead dog story you told me?   Yeah what about it?   Well I Googled it. It is on my phone.   You are checking up on me?   I am...   You do not believe me?   I got it bookmarked here so...   These things happened to me. I am telling you the truth.   Dead dog subway story - you see?   Is this some kind of joke? Did you make this website?   Snokes ? No I did not make Snokes.   I have never seen this before.   Are you sure? 'ecause maybe you saw it and you thought it happened to you.   OK so now I am crazy.   No.   Great.   No I am not saying you are crazy.   This happened to me. Look I can prove it. I have a scar from...   You have a scar yeah.   It was awful.   I am just...   I have a newspaper clipping of when the satellite landed in my yard.   OK.   I can show you these things but I do not know if I even care to show you anymore.   Can we just - hey let us go take a look at the giant whale. You know the giant whale? They have a life-size giant whale. It is amazing.   Giant whale?   You have a giant whale story?   No.   Hey what is up? How did it go?   Great great it went great. Everything's fine all right - wonderful.    Yeah.   Are you all right?   No I screwed things up with Sam.   What do you mean you screwed up?   Well I basically called her a liar and drove her away.   Did she lie to you?   I mean OK well she tells me that she was in Bali once and she had a lump on her arm and it turned out there was a spider living inside her.   You know that story right?   Yeah everybody knows that story.   And this is Sam girl with the dead dog - same girl?   Same girl.   What is she the same babysitter that like got a phone call and it was coming from in the house?   Well she also told me that a piece of satellite landed in her backyard when she was a kid.   I would run if I were you.   Well no but that is the thing is she is so great otherwise. I mean she tells these stories but she is...   There is no way man.   Here's the thing. When you told me you were dating that girl with the spider tattoo on her neck...   Yeah but she was really cool. It is not like she was a juggalo or something. Like come on.   Well Sam's really cool too and she is not a juggalo.   All right.   That is what I am saying. She is great. She is warm. She is funny. She is beautiful.   So like what did she say when you called her out?   She will not back down. She will not back down. She swears these things happened to her.   I mean if all these things really happened to her - which is highly doubtful - but if they did there is got to be some way to find out.    OK satellite lands in backyard of Portsmith  family. There is a picture. Here's a picture.   Is that her in the picture?   Yeah yeah that is her. It is got her name on here and everything.   Wow.   So this really happened to her.   Wow.   I wonder if that spider thing happened to her. Hang on I am going to Google spider plus her name.    Hello?   Hey I got you.   Oh.   You picked up.
