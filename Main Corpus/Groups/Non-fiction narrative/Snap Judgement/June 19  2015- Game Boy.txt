 OK so I start college and I do not have a major. They are steady talking about what you want to do with your life? I have not a clue but I like video games - you know playing Pac-Man with my friends and such. So when the clipboard lady asks me if I enjoy computers I say yeah the kind that you can play. So she writes it down - computer science major. Well you are going to need a rigorous mathematical background in order to get into the higher-level courses. She prints out my course schedule - analytic geometry II elementary probability differential equations. And yes I know that I have the math aptitude of a turnip. I am that self-aware but I think maybe just being in the classes with these people maybe something will finally click into place.   My first days are bewildering. Everyone speaks a language I do not understand so I wait for the fog to clear. I go to class I nod write things down in my little notebook go to class I nod right things down in my little notebook. I power through I listen. I open myself up to the instructions they are trying to impart. I am optimistic and I know it is just about to happen just about to make sense. On my calendar I can see it - several exams all scheduled for the same day. Whatever's going to happen has to happen before that fateful hour something - a change an aha moment something anything. And even on exam day brushing my teeth eating my cereal walking toward my probability class I expect this change to occur. And when the professor hands the exam to me and I see that it is written in an alien language for maybe the first time I understand that whatever the clipboard lady thinks video games are not in my future.
