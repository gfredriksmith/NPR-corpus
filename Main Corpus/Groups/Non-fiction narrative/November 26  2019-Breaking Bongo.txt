     Hey I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.   And today ....   Buh buh buh buh buh buh. All right we are on the corner of 3rd and 42nd heading east.   Were talking about what are we talking about? Were talking about your ...   Were talking about ...   Your ex-pat rebellion.   Yes.   Okay I like it.   And as you just heard it comes from our producer Simon Adler.   And a quick warning if you have got kids listening there are a few curse words in this story so just be warned. Okay here's Simon.   Right. So ...   All right. Another police checkpoint here.   A month or so back ...   Have your bags open!   Have your bags open!   Lets see if I can get through.   I went down to the United Nations looking for this group of activists.   Okay.   I was walking down Second Ave. And that morning the UN General Assembly was in session so security was super-tight. Lots of guys with guns. And they had cordoned off everything within about a block of the UN building itself.   You wanna see whats in my bag?   After getting searched ...   So I am at the entrance here.   I ended up on 47th Street which is a block that security had designated as a protest corridor.   We are here to oppose ...   So on this one block security had divided the street into a dozen or so quadrants.   Chinese Communist Party! Its a mafia!   Each quadrant occupied by a different protest group yelling at the UN.   What do we want?   Freedom!   When do we want it?   Now!   And so I was suddenly thrust into this frothing technicolor mass.   Lets move! Allez allez! Let us go let us go let us go!   Okay and this seems to be Protest Alley.   Of people shouting waving flags and shaking placards. I mean you could pick any cause any issue on the planet that you would like to protest show up and there will be at least seven other people ...      ... protesting it along with you.   Really? So who -- wait who was out there?   Oh you name it.   My issue is Palestine-Israel.   Folks who were pro-Palestine    We are protesting against the Buhari government!   Anti-Nigerian government climate change activists. Most groups had their own little 10-foot-by-30-foot area marked by police barricades. And so every few steps you would encounter a different cause. I mean on 47th Street on the far left side of it you had these Egyptian-Americans just going wild.   We are for Egypt.   Okay.   And for the President Sisi.   Chanting in support of President Sisi. While just 60 feet away on the other side of the street ...   Down down Sisi!   Down down Sisi!   ... theres an anti-Sisi Egyptian protest going. And then smack dab in the middle of all of this chaos are the Falun Gong protesters probably 100 of them decked from head to toe in bright yellow standing like statues perfectly still and silent.   This is a -- a buffet of discontentedness.   All of the protesters were facing the UN yelling in that direction trying to get the attention of the media or presumably of the diplomats walking in. But this one group ...   Okay let us see if I can find my ...   The group I was there to see in fact. They had their backs turned to the UN. They were taking a totally different approach because their audience was actually halfway around the world.   Ah and here is a friend. Joel.   How you doing?   Good to see you man!   They are from Gabon. Its a small little country on the west coast of Africa. And the reason these Gabonese folks had gathered around the UN was to protest against their long-time quote-unquote President dictator Ali Bongo.   Like B-O-N-G-O?   Bongo like the drum. Anyway they were this sort of eclectic group. One of them Joel was wearing a Gabonese flag as a cape.   The best dressed activist of the whole lot!   Yeah!   Another Yorrick was in a suit.   Coming from work.    You guys expecting more people to show up?   Well hopefully so.   And there were only like seven of them there. But one of them always had their phone out.   I need this live.   Shooting video.   All right all right all right all right. Somebody want to say something?   And live-streaming it.   Because we live! Africa is watching us. Lets ...   This is why I would come to see them. Because while everybody else at the UN that day was trying to get the media or the people around them to take notice these Gabonese activists were broadcasting directly to the people of Gabon.   Ali Bongo deserve ...   Through videos and tweets and Facebook posts they were fighting a government thousands of miles away.     Finding that this distance was surprisingly empowering but also perilous. Because it sent them down this path to creating an alternative reality that crash them straight into the limits of using truth to create political change.   But how exactly?     Check check. One two three four five.   Well let me back up a little bit.   Mm-hmm.   The first time I met this group of Gabonese activists was at this annual vigil.   Do you mind telling me where we are and what were doing here?   Okay. Excuse me. For the church where are we in the church? Which church is that again?   Here in New York.   Saint Aloysius.   Saint Aloysius. Okay.   So we are in Saint Aloysius Church.   This is Franck Jocktane.   Its a Catholic Church in -- is this Harlem?   Harlem yeah.   Yeah Saint Aloysius in Harlem. Okay.   Okay.   And I met him in the entryway of this huge Roman Catholic cathedral on 132nd Street.   And uh ...   I think were gonna go now. Well talk more.   Okay well talk more.   We went inside and there were about nine people there.   Otherwise empty church?   Otherwise empty church.    The service is beginning.     Everyone was gathered in the first couple rows of pews. The whole thing was in French and it was basically just a Catholic mass.   Bonjour.   Bonjour mon pre.   But then this woman Elvine Adjembe in a red blouse and black slacks goes up to the lectern and starts reading out these names.      And who are these people?   Well they are the names of several dozen men and women who were killed by Ali Bongo's government.      And what happened? Why were they killed?   Well ...   I mean you know there are consequences for Gabonese people going against the regime.   This is Elvine the woman you just heard reading those names.   Elvine Adjembe. And yeah.   Elvine is an activist by night academic by day.   I work as a researcher for NYU looking at sexual behavior sexual health. And I live in Harlem.   She moved here from Gabon in 2006. And she says on the ground back in Gabon ...   Protesting openly is impossible. Anybody that has been outspoken is threatened and arrested you know by the Bongo regime.   And to understand how Gabon got to this place she says ...    Oh well how far do you wanna go?    You go -- you go as -- as far back as you want to.      Youve really gotta go back to the beginnings of the country.   Okay. Gabon was colonized by France.   In the 1800s. And they governed Gabon until 1960 when the French pulled out and shortly thereafter handed power over to a man named Omar Bongo.     Ali Bongos dad.   And Omar Papa Bongo had no political experience. Ruled the country between 1967 and 2009.   Totaling ...   42 years.   This by the way is Brett Carter.   And I study politics in Central Africa.   Now over the course of these four decades ...   Omar Bongo served the interests of ruling Gabonese elite and the French elite. Not average citizens in Gabon.   Papa Bongo basically made himself and his cronies wealthy while the rest of the country crumbled. Gabon is an oil-rich country and while they were pumping thousands of barrels of the stuff a day next to none of that revenue was invested in things like roads or schools. Of course he controlled the army he cracked down on the press. Bought off and killed off political opponents. And while Omar was busy with all this running the country into the ground ...     His son Ali was busy trying to get his disco career off the ground. Now his career as an entertainer did not work out but in 2009 ...   When Omar Bongo died ...       Ali found another calling.   Ali Bongo became the dictator so-called president as you would hear it of Gabon.   Okay so it is been Bongo followed by a Bongo.   Bongo-Bongo.   Bingo-bango-bongo. Okay.   And now there was an election in 2009 that put Ali Bongo in power. But ...   There is obvious electoral fraud on behalf of the Bongo regime.   The election was marred with paying voters for voters' cards giving citizenship to foreigners in exchange for votes. So he is elected but it is not an actual election.   And when Ali took over the country continued to spiral. Thousands of Bongo's allies were put on the government payroll but never expected to work. A third of the country remained stuck below the poverty line. All while Bongo was adding to his collection of hundreds of luxury cars and scores of French villas. And along with all of this came violence.   Well my brother ...   Again Franck Jocktane.   ... a little brother who was politically involved with one of Ali Bongo opponent.   And right away Franck says Bongo cracked down.   You have people entering his house in the middle of the night terrifying his children. Being harassed by the police. And I mean my mother was calling me for example crying and stuff like this.   Like she was actually afraid that your brother could be killed for his political positions?   That is correct. That is correct. So I felt that she was asking me to help -- to -- to help out.   But at this point Franck was already living here in the States. He would arrived in 1991 and was working in IT.   You know I was so far from the country. And so what I do is go to Twitter made a profile and ...   Typed in ...   Gabon is not a country with good governance. Something like that. Then I put the hashtag Gabon WhiteHouse CNN and I sent my first tweet when there was nothing else that I could do.   And while he never heard back from the White House or CNN ...   No they didnt really respond but what it did is connect me to other Gabonese people who when they saw the tweet they tweet back.   And in that moment Frank tapped into this digital Gabon. This diffuse online network made up of ...   Gabonese people living abroad.   People like Elvine.   In Europe Barcelona.   Paris.   New York.   Washington DC.   Posting videos sharing their frustrations. And all basically saying ...   We do not agree with whats going on in Gabon. We need to stand up and end the Bongo regime.   And this digital Gabon they set their sights on the 2016 presidential election when Ali Bongo would have to run to hold onto power.   We all decided okay we gonna -- we gonna win this.   This is Yorrick.   Yorrick. Yorrick Iyune. And what am I supposed to say again?   He is also an activist.   So they are pinning their hopes on having a free and fair election which they have never had?   Well yeah.   If you know that the dictator's hell-bent on winning come what may I wonder why that is even plausible?   Well first of all plausible or not I think these Gabonese folks living outside of the country felt a real moral imperative here. Like we are not subject to the same risks as people living inside the country.   We thought because we were diaspora we have the responsibility to influence the political game in Gabon.   They believed they could do things campaigning and politicking that would have been very dangerous or even impossible on the ground. And second of all they had a plan.   So ...     First -- first of all what we started to do is that ...     We put pressure on the opposition to find us one candidate.     And thank God ...     They heard us ...   And coalesced behind the candidacy of Jean Ping.   Again Brett Carter.   I mean there was this sense that you know Jean Ping was somebody who would implement a much more transparent government. And ultimately represented change.   And this coalescing was important because one of the ways the Bongos had always won while maintaining this sort of appearance of democracy was because there would be so many different opposition candidates splitting the vote.     And so this was going be the most competitive Gabonese presidential election in Gabonese history.   The diaspora started flooding social media with pro-Jean Ping posts. And then on top of that as the election got closer they set up this network of people throughout the country to go to polling stations on election day where they would film on their smartphones as the votes were being tallied.   So when they count the votes we can film everything post it on social media. Nobody's going to cheat us anymore.   And so ...     The day of the election comes. Jean Ping versus Ali Bongo.   Yes.   Were you -- were you in Gabon or were you in New York at that point or ...   I was here in New York.   Okay.   I was at the consulate. We started getting results. And its -- it becomes very very clear ...      that Jean Ping is winning.   And seemingly by a lot. According to their election monitoring videos and -- and early results I mean it looked like out of the nine provinces in Gabon ...   Seven had voted predominantly for him.   And meanwhile online ...     Elvine found a flood of video clips coming out of Gabon.   People actually out in the streets celebrating. They were crying. People were opening champagne. You know This is it! This is -- were done with the Bongo regime. We -- we did it! And -- and here as members of the diaspora there was just -- there was a lot of joy everywhere.   But ...   Exactly.  So we are starting to think Okay something is not right. They are going to do something.     The results started to delay.   Specifically because they were not getting the vote counts from one final province.   Haut-Ogoou the last province. So were waiting.   A day goes by. Then a second and a third. And then finally ...   After four days of waiting ...   The electoral commission declared a 99 percent turnout in Haut-Ogoou province.     They announced that basically everyone in this province voted which was significantly higher than turnout rates in the rest of the country and of the 99.93 percent of people that voted ...   95 percent cast their ballot for Ali Bongo.   The equivalent of like every single person in Wisconsin voting Democrat.   Results you know that are just not true. But are just enough to give Bongo the victory over Jean Ping.   Just enough so that he would remain president and dictator of Gabon. And I mean come on. What can you possibly do? I mean its blatant! So blatant so obvious. There is no way.   Yeah this is a profoundly -- a profoundly fraudulent election. You know no one thought that the 2016 election would be at all fair. But this sort of obvious electoral fraud was basically unprecedented.   We reached out to the Gabonese government to get their side of all this. They did not return our request for comment.   And so when the results are announced ...     Videos start popping up online but this time they show ...   People getting furious.       And now riots start.   I mean it was -- it was -- it was chaos.     Watching from Paris New York DC ...   The diaspora we dont know whats going on.   Other than what they can see in these video clips being uploaded.   People were sending us videos of people in the street.     What the army was doing to the people.     We hear that the building of the General Assembly is burning.   Oh my gosh!   And then ...     Elvine ends up on the phone with her brother-in-law who is at the headquarters of Jean Ping and he says there are soldiers trying to get in.   We could hear shots. We could hear him saying Okay theyre coming up theyre coming up! And then at some point ...       His cell phone died. So now ...   Jesus!   ... were thinking. Okay hes -- hes -- hes going to die.   And right around then as well the internet in the entire country is shut off. So these people living outside the country who are -- who are -- who feel like theyre -- theyre sort of in the action basically mediated by a phone screen obviously but theyre -- it feels pretty live and real are suddenly cut off.   The -- the powerlessness it is -- yes it is the feeling of powerlessness. There is nothing absolutely nothing that you can do. You feel like a puppet essentially. It is -- it is really you have this kind of double consciousness that you function with. It feels unreal. I am not in Gabon. This is what is going on there but at the same time here -- and personally I am a teacher and I have to talk to my students about psychology about sex and gender about stats. So you are -- you are just overwhelmed. You do not know what to do. You do not know what you can do.   Do -- do we know what happened there?   Well they didnt know anything for several days. But when they were able to get back in touch in the case of Elvine they found out that her brother-in-law was okay. He would been arrested but was okay. And more broadly they learned what happened was ...   Bongo basically ordered his Republican guard which has a series of sort of like you know fighter helicopters armed with missiles basically and they opened fire on the -- on Pings headquarters.   Jesus!   Filled with people both in and outside. Now the death toll from that helicopter assault is unclear.   We still do not have the full count to this day.   But at least two dozen three dozen.      And so this is what they were gathered at that church to commemorate.   Merci.   Now in Gabon after these attacks ...     We basically went back to that cemetery peace that we have always had.   Things went back to the way they were before the election with Ali Bongo in power and the people of Gabon really unable to do anything about it. But Elvine Franck and other activists living outside the country they had seen what an effect they could have. That they could move people in a way that they had not been moved before. But they also were confronting the limits to all of that power. And so it felt like a decision point.   I do not want to call it an emergence you know or an awakening but there was a sense that this was a watershed moment.   There was no longer a candidate to support no election to watchdog but they thought the least they could do is try to get the UN or the western media to pay attention to what had happened.   We are here because of an injustice in Gabon.   The form this usually took was a couple of these activists.   La resistance ...   Going out in front of the Gabonese embassy in Paris or DC.   We have a tyrant called Ali Bongo.   And they just sort of give a monologue and live-stream for 30 minutes hoping CNN would do some story on them or the UN would pass some resolution. But it did not really work.   At first we were very naive because we assumed okay people are being killed in Gabon obviously the United Nations is going to react and do something. And then we very quickly discovered oh you poor thing.         Nobody in the west was paying any attention. But back in Gabon people were. With the help of a reporter in Libreville the capital of Gabon we talked to lots of people. People whose names we are not using out of concern for their safety who said they were tuning into these videos the activists were posting because I mean in the wake of the 2016 election everybody was terrified to talk about what happened for obvious reasons. But ...     ... then they would come across these videos the diaspora was posting. And they would see people not just speaking about how the election was stolen and how people were killed but also condemning it. And it was revelatory. They heard someone giving voice to feelings they had but could not say.     But that was not the end goal here.   I mean we wanted to end the Bongo regime.   They -- they felt like they hit the limit of what this sort of media they were generating could produce.   It was timid because it was at its infancy all right? By the way I want -- just want to let you know that Alain is here too so he just step in.   Oh great! Alain welcome.   Yes how you doing? Welcome to have me here.   Alain-Serge Obame is an activist as well. And together he and Franck were putting out a lot of these videos playing around with different ways to try to spark some change.   Mm-hmm.   Yes. Until the hotel when it blows up.   So in this video that was filmed and streamed live the first thing that you see is a straight-on shot of Alains goateed face big smile.     Peering straight into the lens of a phone camera that hes holding out at arms length. He swivels around points the camera at Franck and introduces him along with a couple other folks that are there with him. And then you notice that there is a reception desk and that theyre inside of this swanky hotel lobby.     It was the Four Season Hotel.   One of the most beautiful the most luxurious hotel in DC.   Marble pillars plush chairs. And the reason that they were there was because a Gabonese official actually the woman who signed off on Ali Bongos election was staying there.   The -- the president of the Constitutional court ...   And we decide just to let her know we not happy with the decisions.     Theyre just milling around the lobby hoping to bump into her I guess when you hear the timbre of Alains voice change. And you see as he trains the cameras lens on this man walking down a hallway towards them into the lobby.     They shove the camera right up into the guys face who is actually their targets husband.     And we started to have an inter -- interaction with him.   And now you see him making a beeline for the elevator. Pushes the button. But its not coming.   And we started to scream at him that you kill people in Gabon and stuff.   At this point ...     Called security.     And moments later these black-suited men start ushering them towards the exit.         Through the revolving doors.     And so now theyre out in the rain and at this point you think they are done. Like they made their point. Theyre not gonna be able to get back inside. But no.     Instead of ending it right there ...     He told the Gabonese people thats where the hotel where she is.   Posted the hotel's phone number and said ...   Blow the phone line.   And thousands of miles away people in Gabon saw it.      People like this guy. He was a student at the time. Says he remembers it well. It was right around 00pm.      Despite not speaking very much English he says he dialed the number.      The receptionist picked up. And he told her that the hotel should not be housing terrorists which she promptly responded to by ...      ... hanging up. But the thing is this guy was not the only one.   No. People from France people from Gabon people from the United States started to call and jam the -- the -- how do you call that? The line. The telephone line.   And suddenly the receptionist is just being bombarded.   Oh my God!   They doxed the hotel.   Wow.   To the point that the Chief Justice no longer felt comfortable.   Uh huh.   And so she goes to a second hotel.   We did the same thing.   She leaves that one she goes to a third hotel. And they do it again. Eventually she ends up staying in like the apartment of her daughter who lives somewhere in DC.   Thats crazy. I thought you were gonna say like a Motel 6 in Newark.     Yeah with no phone line yeah. And for the folks back in Gabon who -- who had been involved in this stunt ...      That so -- have such powerful people in Gabon could be humiliated like this.   And they did not just see it this act of political expression. I mean they were actually able to safely and consequentially take part in it. In fact one woman in Gabon described the experience and the feeling as ...      The very evisceration of time and space.   And -- and when we saw that effect we enjoyed it and we said that thats what were gonna do from now on.   This they realize is the move.     And so every time a Gabonese official would show up in the States or in France ...   We will track them.   Live streaming as they show up wherever the persons at.     And begin harassing them.     And shaming the hotel.     And a couple times it actually worked.   We tracked down the Cabinet Director.       And they kick him out.   In Paris they track down Ali Bongos brother in law. And posted a video of themselves going into the Gabonese embassy and swapping out the framed photo of Ali Bongo hanging on the wall for a photo of Jean Ping. They even doxed the hotel of Ali Bongo himself.     And these videos staged and filmed by members of the diaspora back in Gabon they were firing people up.   They -- like do some of these people get to be well-known?   Oh they became celebrities. One person referred to them as celebrities inside the country.   Oh!   Which even at a distance could be dangerous. This is something I talked to them about when I was first meeting everyone at this barbecue.   Do you mind just introducing yourself on tape here?   Oh okay. My name is Innocent. Innocent. Someone who is not guilty so yeah.    Pretty much all of them told me that they and their families had at some point been targeted by the Bongo regime.   Everyone here. Almost all our families back home. And to be honest they are worried. My mom told me to stop it.   Your mom she called you?   Yeah. She said No I dont want you -- I dont want you to be part of that. You got to stop it.   My family back home I dont call.   This is fellow activist Joel Mambsy.   You dont call them from your own cellphone number?   No no. Its been three years. I cut it off -- to try to keep them away from trouble. Thats why I am keeping myself away.   And whats totally off limits it seems is going back.   I mean that -- thats gonna be dangerous. Yeah.  There are people who going back home because of the election you know? And he got  he got arrested.   What -- whats his name?   Uh Landry?   Okay.   Landry yeah.   Now Landry it turns out is actually the brother of Alain-Serge Obame.   Yeah. And Landry was like a superstar of videos.   In fact he was one of the first activists to really be making videos. All the way back before the 2016 election. At the time he was living in Miami working as a businessman and was a huge Jean Ping booster.   He went back to Gabon right before the 2016 election to support Jean Ping and do the campaign.   But when his plane touched down in Libreville the capital ...   When he get there to the airport they kidnap him. 12 people kidnap him. And  it was long time before I heard from him.   Hello?    Hello can you hear me?   With Alains help ...   You can hear me?   Yes I can.   Hey. Hey okay. Were -- were recording.   Yep.   Okay.   Okay.   I was able to talk to Landry.   My name is Landry Washington calling from the prison cell in Libreville Gabon.   How are you calling me right now?   They have a special service here at the prison where we can make a phone call.   Do the prison guards or does anyone know that youre talking to me?   They probably listen to all my phone conversations. They are certain things that you understand that I cannot -- I cannot say over the phone. The conditions are not -- are not -- are very very very difficult.   And just to be clear you are an American citizen yeah?   I am an American citizen.   A US citizen and he is just being held?   Yeah. Someone from the US Embassy visits him every two weeks or so.   Oh!   So he is got folks in the West keeping an eye on him.   I see.   And probably that plus the Bongo regime trying to maintain some appearance of democracy and the rule of law is why he can even talk to me at all.   Because you know they want to hide and pretend that it is a democracy it is this and that.   But that being said I -- I was concerned given everything Id heard about broadcasting his voice about broadcasting any of this. And -- and I raised that with him.   Im not worried at all. As a matter of fact I really want you to do that. I know who Im dealing with ...   Well and why arent you worried?   Because Simon listen to me. My rights have been violated from the beginning.   Mm-hmm.   At this point I cannot be scared now. Just do what you have to do.   Okay.   Yeah.   Landry has been in prison for over three years now. He shares a small little cement cell with a mattress on the floor. And he told me that after they grabbed him at the airport ...   I didnt know -- I didnt really know what was happening. And they took me from there to the local police station.   And he found out that charges were being brought against him.   Incitement of violence. And outrage of the president.   Asserting that he was a threat to the Gabonese people and to the president Ali Bongo. All based on his social media posts.   They went to the internet to my Facebook page. Print everything that I was writing from my video everything that was said. Things that Ive done basically expressing my freedom of speech while I was in the United States. And this is the thing that they was using against me.   All stuff hed posted from Miami. That was the evidence. And now I cant say that Ive watched every minute of every video that Landry has ever uploaded but the stuff that I have is pretty tame. I mean Rush Limbaugh or even Rachel Maddow is more likely to incite violence than this guy. But when his case finally went to trial ...   I was found guilty. And the judge she said you can spend the rest of your -- your life in prison.   She said you could spend the rest of your life in prison?   Yeah thats what she told me the judge. Thats what she told me.   What is the American government doing to help you at the moment?   I dont really know what exactly they are doing. Im American. I am an American. And Im still here. Living on the condition -- on the very hard condition for almost four years. For what?   Yeah.   For what? For what reason? Who spend four years -- who spend four years in prison for speaking up his mind? Who?   As for what is going to happen to Landry we -- we reached out to the State Department.   One of the most important tasks of the Department of State is to provide assistance to US citizens who are incarcerated or detained.   And they gave us a written statement that were willing to read to us.   Counselor officers have sought to provide Mr. Washington all appropriate counselor assistance.   The gist of it was they know he is there. They have spoken with the Gabonese government but there is not really much more they can do.   And -- and so I cannot ask any follow-up questions. That is sort of -- that is what we have got to work with huh?   Yes. I am sorry about that but I -- that is all I can talk with you about on the record for right now.   We also gave Landrys Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman-Shulz a call multiple times in fact and sent multiple emails. And she did not return our request for comment.   I dont know whats gonna happen. Because nothing was normal. Nothing is normal. Theyre just trying to keep me here as much time as they can thinking that theyre gonna -- Im gonna get down theyre gonna broke my mind. No! I die for my rights. Im American! I wont give up my rights for anything even if I have to give my life! They expect me maybe to change to give up my -- I wont do that! I dont care how long its gonna take. I will still gonna be the same. Im gonna still speak up my mind!   Were gonna take a quick break.       Jad.   Robert.   Radiolab.   Back to Simon.   Right. So at this point weve got a brutal dictator a series of scam elections people murdered and a US citizen imprisoned. And a diaspora doing what they can from a distance. They have gotten some traction but the Bongo regime is fighting back threatening their families. And I should say sometime in 2016 these activists stop just doing political stunts to rile people up. They also started providing facts. As was explained to us freedom of the press in Gabon really is not a thing. The Bongos have a long history of suspending publications and banning journalists who -- who report things they dont like. Thats actually why were not naming the journalist who helped us conduct these interviews in Gabon. And so folks like Franck essentially became news broadcasters.   Yes so I was using the platform that I have in order to spread the -- the information. Yes.   Like what kind of things?   Everything from palace intrigue inside the Bongo regime to things like if a riot was being quashed in Port-Gentil.   They would report that.   They would report that.   Well how would they know that if they were living in the District of Columbia?   Well inside of the Bongo government there is people who do -- do not like that system. So they call us and they contact us. Sometimes even the international press. And also I mean I have people on the ground. They tell me what they see what they hear.   After he would get this information Franck says he would usually make a video sometimes send a tweet and boom! Thousands of people would know about it.   And then the audience gets now to actually see what is going on in their own country on a bounce from Canada or America or France?   Exactly.   Huh.   It is looking across the ocean to see what is going on in your own backyard.   Yeah. Yeah wow.      And for people like this businesswoman this was a big deal. She says at the end of the day after she is put her kids to bed she sits down for what she calls Gabon time. 30 minutes or so where she scrolls through what the diaspora is posting. And at this point she really relies on them for facts.   And so one of my fear is to relay what Donald Trump will call fake news. And because of that yes I have to be like a journalist. I have to really dig deep and make sure that my sources are legit and make sure that what they are saying is true.   They were basically these remote newsrooms. But then things got complicated.   I was home. I was surfing the internet. I think some time around 00-00 pm?   Again this is Elvine Adjembe.   I come across a tweet from a reporter from the Washington Post Siobhn OGrady saying Ive heard rumors that Ali Bongo is dead.   And ...   Like what goes through your head first?   Shock. There was no indication that he was sick or anything and that just seemed too easy. Is -- is that possible? Is -- is that a thing? Are we just free from dictatorship just like that?   No. It -- it ...   Academic Brett Carter was equally confused.   Uh yeah.  At that point my sense from communicating with people incidentally on Twitter was that Ali Bongo was in Riadh Saudi Arabia for a conference and -- and he suffered some kind of health crisis. But whether his heart was still beating remains unclear.   That is -- that is -- that is what we knew.   And as they looked for news of this coming out of Gabon ...   Nothing. Nothing.   For four whole days the government doesnt even acknowledge that anything is going on. Until ...   On October 28th ...     The spokesperson of the government comes out and says Well Ali Bongo felt dizzy and he went -- he was taken to the hospital and he was diagnosed with      Severe fatigue. Severe fatigue.   And that any other claims are just ...     Fake news.     And your response or reaction is what?    Thats complete bullshit come on! Thats not thats -- of course thats bullshit.   I mean when Omar -- Papa Bongo ...   Alis dad.   ... died in 2009 there are people who think that there were -- you know there was three weeks between Omar Bongos death and its announcement.   Three weeks!   Yes.   So theres precedent.   Okay.   For them hiding deaths.     And I mean immediately following this government press release ...   It was the very next day.     Reuters the media outlet Reuters reports that ...     Ali Bongo had a stroke.   Totally contradicting the official account. And then ...   November 6 ...   Two weeks later.   Yes.   Okay.   A French government official tweets Ali Bongo est mort. Ali Bongo is deceased.   Like an official of the French government?   Yes.   The municipal counselor of Lents. We ask him questions and he just -- he doesnt say anything.   God damn!   Then there are reports that the Gabonese government has changed their position.     And at this point its been like a month and there have been no sightings of Ali Bongo and no comments from him.   Bongo was totally incommunicado. And -- and one just doesnt go days without hearing from Ali Bongo. That just doesnt happen.   And when a couple news outlets in Gabon tried to cover this story ...   They were suspended as a result. Look I mean everybody suspected that you know clearly something was wrong and the regime is hiding something right? He is probably impaired cognitively or perhaps dead.   And online the hundreds of Gabonese activists quickly split into factions.   There were two camps. There was one camp that was saying We need to assess the health of Ali Bongo.   Like lets figure out what we know and what we dont know. Let us be -- let us still be journalists basically.   Mm-hmm.   And there was other camp that was like We should provoke the Gabonese people to react by saying Ali Bongo is dead.   Interesting. Lets use this information.   Right. Or -- or this confusion. And so this online conversation begins.   I said that you know enough is enough. Our way of thinking we have to evolve.   Again this is Frank Jocktane.   And in other word if we dont adapt then we will -- we will perish.   And eventually ...   We just emerged online and it felt like an epidemic.   Francks side won out.   We wanted them to have their backs against the wall and so yes we start pushing using social media this whole idea that Ali Bongo is dead.   Lets just say hes dead because it is politically advantageous for us to do that.   Correct.     Lets use this uncertainty. Because remember it could be true. There are reasons to think it might be true. And even if he is not actually dead he is absent. And so they really flood social media with this. Thousands of tweets hundreds of hours of video.   Hoping that this is going to create a ripple effect so that maybe the people will rise up and -- and do something.   And do what exactly?   Essentially they were hoping people in Gabon would demand new elections and start a revolution.   So thats why we said that we will do what we have never done before.   In fact this sort of became their catchphrase We are going to do what we have never done before. But then the truth got foggier.     So every New Year's Bongo traditionally gives a speech.   Were you expecting one this year? Were you ...   No we were not.   Okay.     At this point its been two months since anyone has heard Ali Bongos voice or seen him in person.   So of course we were all waiting for that video. So once the video is posted I saw it on social media.   She clicked on it. It starts with the sound of Gabons national anthem and this still shot of the presidential palace. And then Ali Bongo appears.     Hes seated behind a desk in a blue suit with this strikingly pink wall as -- as the backdrop.   And then theres a -- theres a flag the countrys flag behind him.     And Elvine says as soon as she heard his voice she thought something's wrong here.   The speech is slurred.     And his face...   The movements the sighs the -- even the facial expression as he speaks. I mean it looks like it has -- his face has been pasted onto something. Its just -- it looks -- it just looks weird.     Uh yes. Something clearly is not right.     And some activists came out with the -- the idea that this is not even him.     That it was a deep fake.     So real quick. Deep fakes are basically videos where one person has taken control of someone elses face and changed what it is doing.     If youre curious we did an entire episode on this and even made our own deep fake of Barack Obama back in 2017. But anyhow while this video was meant to be proof that Ali Bongo was alive to these activists watching online it was exactly the opposite.   The -- the term that people used at first was puppet right? You know this was -- you know this was a puppet.   Is it a deep fake? I do not know. We talked to some digital forensics folks. They dont know. I mean if Bongo did in fact have a stroke that could explain the speech and the face. But that did not stop the diaspora from pushing this idea that it was a deep fake.   I mean that became the most predominant theory about what went on with that video.   And this is where you see that the activists tactics have shifted. In digging through their old posts you can see signs that this was coming. Like there were a couple other videos of Ali Bongo that had come out. They were weird as well. Like they only show one side of his face and you never hear him speaking. But that said he looks alive. And yet the activists said those were fakes too.   Do you think that was him in that video?   It was not him.   It was not him.   I doubt it. It was not him. It was a body double.   A what?   A body double. Like an impersonator.   This is my strong belief. Ali Bongo we see that is not the real Ali Bongo we know about. And a lot of people believe that.   And your thought? You think he is dead?   I think he is dead. For me he is dead. Right now they use -- they just use a fake guy he wear a mask and then do all this stuff. They do it right now.   And to prove that Ali Bongo is dead they start posting these new sorts of videos. These shots of what appear to be a dead body lying in a hospital bed with the face blurred out that are clearly fake. And all the while the international press at this point BBC Al Jazeera were reporting that in fact Ali Bongo was very much alive. They even dug up this old birtherism conspiracy theory questioning if Bongo was even born in Gabon.   Mmm. Like the birther thing from the Trump campaign?   It is spookily close.   That is Trump 101 right there.   And like it is hard to prove where Ali Bongo was born but again they pushed that message nonetheless. And this campaign worked. When our reporter on the ground in Gabon spoke to people there many many of them I cannot say what percentage but a huge number of people she spoke with believed Ali Bongo was dead.   So essentially they were waging a kind of fake news campaign.   Yeah that is one way to put it. And I found myself feeling -- feeling really uncomfortable about that. Like yes I am rooting for them but -- but suddenly they are just straight-up lying. You know doing things that feel really similar to what Russians did here in 2016. And so I -- I asked Franck about all this.   Mm-hmm.   Like do you -- as weve talked about the information you and other members of the diaspora are putting out people from Gabon are looking to the only real quote-unquote free press they have access to.   That is correct.   You are seen as the reporters the arbiters of truth in the country.   Of course. Yes it is true that as we speak there is a lot of people that we are influencing in Gabon. Thats pretty amazing I think.   Well yeah. But then at the same time you all have pushed this message that Ali Bongo is dead.   Mm-hmm.   When in fact its unverifiable and yet ...   Thats correct.   ... you have pushed that.   Well personally I have not said really that Ali Bongo is dead. I am not -- because I have been smart enough not to say that. But what I do say is that Ali Bongo is not the same. Now people can interpret that any kind of way and I leave it vague like that on purpose.   Right. But like you all put out the -- the hashtag Ali Bongo is dead or Ali Bongo cest mort. You ...   Est mort. Yeah. I relay that information but I -- personally I never said that he was dead. Like I said because I need a death certificate okay? But of course we live in a world where sensation is -- is important. Ali Bongo is dead. I mean its gonna sell. I mean it attract people because hes a head of states. But what Im concerned about is the betterment of my people. And personally I dont believe anymore in election in Gabon because the people in power have found ways and means to trick and stole elections. And so yes Im doing on purpose to incite our people to stand up for a new Gabon a better Gabon and force this government to -- to bow down. The country's wealthy enough for them to be able to eat educate their children basic things. And if there is a government that do not allow them to experience this then yes this government for me need to be overthrown. Thats what I wanna encourage my people to do. But that doesnt mean that we -- we need to fabricate stuff.   Like trafficking in the hashtag Ali Bongo is dead I could see someone interpreting that as fabrication of information. But you dont see it that way.   That is -- I mean. Well unfortunately we -- we are -- we are at war.   Wow. I have a lot of feelings about this.   Well yeah I think we all do. But before we get to them theres one final beat to this story.   I think January 5th ...   January 7th actually. So one week after that quote-unquote Deep fake video came out.   I think it was one? One in the morning.   Okay.   One of my sisters lives in Gabon and we were texting and we were talking and sending voice messages and she was going to work. And then at some point she texts all of us and she says Im going home. Theres a coup. Im thinking Thats weird. Whats -- whats going on?   And moments later someone sent her a link to this video.     The video of the coup announcement.   It opens with a soldier sitting behind a desk speaking into a microphone his eyes are looking down. He is reading off of a script. Behind him hes flanked by two other soldiers brandishing automatic rifles. Theyre all in camouflage and wearing these bright green berets.     And what these three men along with four others had done was storm the national broadcaster.   Took over a TV channel.   And -- and were broadcasting this on a loop.     And as Elvine is watching this for the -- for the first time ...   You know I hear them saying Go if you can get guns.     And they reference the New Years day video saying its proof that quote Gabon has lost its dignity and that Bongo is at best an invalid. But despite all this she doesnt quite know what to make of it. Should she trust these people? Is this a good thing?   I mean those unknown young men. And the whole thing is what in the world is going on? But then ...     The leader the guy was reading the -- the -- I dont know how to call that.   Again activist Alain-Serge Obame who was also watching this video very early that morning.   The guy reading the manifestos they say ...     Nous allons faire ce que na jamais te fais. That mean we need to do something thats never been done before. One of the slogan be we using for years.   Their catchphrase their words coming from the mouth of this man with a gun in Gabon telling people to take to the streets and overthrow the Bongo regime.   And then I just rewinded the -- the videos one more time and to check did he just say that?     And then I saw that again. I was -- the tear coming out of my -- my eye. I was like Wow! That mean people been listening to us for all this time.   And right around that time from Libreville videos started showing up online showing people filling the streets.   And I thought it was the end for real.   And for people like Alain and Elvine watching all this on their phone screens lying in bed or sitting up at the kitchen table ...   You feel like youre there and youre participating. Youre -- youre -- youre an actor. You forget that youre not in Gabon. But then I think it was around 12 in Gabon so it must have been like 00 am or something here. I was texting family members and all of a sudden they could not receive my messages anymore. Thats -- thats when I knew that okay they shut down the internet again.   And she suddenly again has no no way to know what is happening.   Maybe Gabonese people are standing up. Maybe theyre in the streets and maybe were putting an end to all of this. Or are they shutting down the internet because its another bloodbath?   Later that day the Gabonese government announced that the coup had been quashed. Gunfire had been exchanged two of the men involved in the coup had died and the rest were arrested.   But were not exactly sure of the details.   And actually they are not even sure it was a real coup.   Was this a legitimate coup? You know even now like I think thats kind of profoundly unclear.   Wait really?   Yeah. Yup. Maybe this was a fake coup right?   And that has happened before.   We had a fake attempt months before that with ...   In this case a man also went to the national broadcaster.   And said Hey we have installed bombs all around the country. For every day that like Bongo stays in power one building is going to blow up. And it turns out that was not true that was not the case. And after that they stormed the headquarters of Mr. Jean Ping again so most us just saw it as a pretext to attack the headquarters of a political opponent. So yeah is this really true? Is this really the Gabonese army doing what weve wanted them to do for so long? Or is it another fakeout? I do not know.   By the time we are at the end of this piece you have made I -- I do not know what the heck is going on honestly. Nobody knows anything. You notice this?   Right. And that is a day-to-day experience in the country. The fog is to a certain degree impenetrable.   But why would -- if this were a good guy-bad guy story the good guys the ones that I am rooting for are the people who are against the dictator. And who had for awhile a cause and a just cause and who were speaking truthfully about what was going on in their country. All of a sudden they have kind of made it a little murky by lying outright and telling you that the lie was saleable. Like that guy ...   I hear you.   Hey Bongo is dead is a great hook.   But also I -- I think that they showed up to what they initially thought was a knife fight to find that the other side had a machine gun. So what -- I do not know what you do if you do not do this.   Here's what you do. When the president disappears in Saudi Arabia and no one says Boo you say Something fishy is going on. And then the internet goes What is it? What is it? What is it? What is it? And you say We do not know. That is what you do.   But I mean when the other side says Oh he is fine. Nothing's wrong. That is such a -- a blatant lie that to counter-balance it ...   With We do not know?   Yeah We do not know just puts you at the fulcrum. It does not put you on the other side of the spectrum allowing you to balance out opinion.   I would stay at the fulcrum because as soon as I start lying to get the -- I start making up something that they -- to counter what they made up because theirs is vivid and mine has to be equally vivid then we are in a whole new ballgame.   Sure -- sure because we are journalists. But maybe for an activist especially in a situation like this maybe they should have a slightly longer rhetorical leash.   Hmm.   Thats the -- I mean ultimately on some level the deep -- the deep troubling is that like even if you agree with what these activists are doing that it is right it still feels like just another example of how there is no longer true or false there is only what is expeditious. What you can use and what you cant use.   But I mean at the end of the day their message -- and I think they really captured this in this video they recently showed me. It is very clever. It is just first them zooming in on someone outside of the UN in a Trump mask and an orange prison jumpsuit with a sign that said like Prison bound or something. And then it pans over and there are two police officers just standing there. And so the story theyre telling here is like here is this man who is -- who is openly mocking the president and the cops are just gonna stand there and not do anything.   Hmm.   That at -- at least for now America is a place that you can have freedom of speech and that from all of that speech hopefully the truth will emerge.
