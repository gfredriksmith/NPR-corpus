  Hey I am Lulu Miller.  Hey hi hi!  Hello.  This is Radiolab. And before we get to the show ...  It is so great to talk to you!  I want to introduce you to someone.  As I am now obsessed with your work.  Oh goodness!  This is Alana Casanova-Burgess. She is another reporter here at WNYC. And earlier this year she released a new show.  Yeah. A history podcast about Puerto Rican life wherever that takes place.  And the reason she is here is because well honestly I just wanted you to know about the show. I have a hunch you like podcasts and this one is beautifully sound designed. It is full of stories with all kinds of plot twists and really interesting people. But I also wanted to take just a couple of minutes to talk to her about this very interesting and kind of maddening choice she made which is what she named the show.  Okay so before you say what it is were there any runner-up names?  I think the worst one is This Puerto Rican Life.    Super bad.  Yeah it is pretty bad.  And then here's another Desahogar which means like relief or venting. Because ahogar means to drown and so when you say to your friend like Oh can I just have a desahogar? Like can I just vent really quick? It means like I am drowning.  Ah! That is good!  Turns out they had a long list.  Territorial or Territoriale. A la la'rriva. Adrift. Insula like having to do with an island. Tostone.  The delicious plantain. That is the sweet one right?  I think you are thinking of marudos.  Really clever name ideas.  Aqui Like We are here. Homeland. La Isla.  And what they finally settled on was ...  La Brega.  Now I cannot tell you what that means because there is no perfect English translation for this word that Puerto Ricans use all the time. And I was so fascinated by this choice to name your show something that will remain inscrutable to so many of your listeners.  Exactly. Yeah.  Now to be fair Alana spends the entire first episode trying to translate the term.  La Brega.  She turns to other Puerto Ricans to try to explain what la brega means.            And finally Alana tries synthesizing all of the meanings of the term herself.  There is an imbalance of power when you are bregando whether it is against your boss or some larger injustice. It is an underdog's word. La brega implies a challenge we cannot really solve so you have to hustle to get around it.  Okay so by the end of the episode do you think you have captured it?  Ooh that is a good question. And actually no.  And this to me at least is the genius of choosing this name. As an outsider knowing that I still do not quite know what la brega means pulls me in. It makes me want to keep looking and listening to try to understand what I am missing out on. And in the rest of the series instead of using words tidy definitions or translations or thesauruses or synonyms to try to explain la brega Alana uses stories. So as Alana tells it la brega is ...  The 2004 Olympics where the Puerto Rican basketball team beat the US.   It was like a David versus Goliath moment.  And in another episode it is how Puerto Ricans respond to the debt crisis.  Being a Puerto Rican now requires you to also be like a disasterologist and an economist.  Or it is how they reacted to the ...  ... surveillance of the independence movement.  Be careful. You know they are going to create a file on you.  Which is one of the few cases in history of ...  ... surveillance records being returned back to the victims of surveillance. This series is an anthology about Puerto Rico. Each episode opens a door to a different aspect of the Puerto Rican experienceour brega and hope you enjoy it.  I sure did. The New York Times did. The New Yorker did. They both just placed it on their best podcast of the year. And you can find La Brega wherever you get your podcasts. Thanks Alana.  Thanks.  So talking to Alana about the secrets hidden behind or beyond words well it got me thinking about this episode I want to play for you that is about the secrets that words can contain. In this case the secret is not being kept from outsiders. The secret is being kept from the person speaking or typing the words. I will let Jad and Robert take it from here.  Hey I am Jad Abumrad.  And I am Robert Krulwich.  Yup. This is Radiolab. And today just to start things off for this podcast all right let us just say that you love an author but somehow the text is not enough.  Okay.  Does not get you close enough to the author. So what do you do?  You know what you do?  What?  Take off your shoes.    You take off your stocks.  As you are standing on the book?  And you stand on the book. And your whole body says Let me in!  Let me in!  Yeah.  Well let me give you a different flavor then.  Hello.  How about you take the text give it to this guy. He puts it into a computer and you turn it into ...  Data.   What do you mean? Who is that?  This is ...  My name is Ian Lancashire. I am a professor of English at the University of Toronto.  Now Ian as he said is an English Professor. But he is also a computer guy.  Right. Founded a computing center with the help of IBM Canada.  And the reason he combines those two is because he is interested in the secrets behind the author's words.  Hmm.  And that desire he says to take a text spin it into data as a way to get into that author's head? Well that goes back a long way.  Goes back to the fathers of the Christian Church.  To the Bible.  In the early Middle Ages.  Some monks decided to make what is called a concordance of the Bible. And what that means is they were gonna take every single word in the Bibleand there are 960243 of them at least in the King James version. They were gonna list them all alphabetically notate each time every single word was used and the context.  Ay yi yi.  Yes. Imagine it. You begin with the first verse.  In the beginning ...   You create a heading for the first word.  In.  And then for the second word.  The.  And then for the third.  Beginning!  Every time you come across those words you have to write a context.  In Genesis 1 verse 1 occurrence one In the beginning. Genesis 1 verse 6 occurrence two. And God said let there be a firmament in the ...  It is all handwritten. And at the end you endwell you end up with a lot of pieces of paper.  So many that it took those first monks who decided to do this an entire lifetime to complete it. Nowadays you know with computers you can be done in ...  In under 15 seconds.  Bam! So that all just basically sets the stage for the story that I am about to tell you. It is the 1980s. Ian is an English Professor in Toronto. He is got a lab full of computers and he is using them to analyze his favorite authors.  Samuel Taylor Coleridge T.S. Eliot James Joyce Chaucer Shakespeare.  And he is turning up some interesting stuff sort of.  For example in his poetry Milton did not use the word Because. Who knows why?  Yeah. But at a certain point Ian decided to look at more modern authors.  And so I turned to Agatha Christie.  At the time he was doing thiswe are now in the '90sAgatha Christie happened to be the most published author ever.  She sold a billion books.  A billion? Like 'B' billion?  She was number one.  Behind God.  After the Bible I think.  So what I did is I collected two of her earliest novels written in the early '20s.  He fed those two into the computer.  Then I did the third.  Eventually he would add in 14 additional books that cover 50 years of Agatha Christie's writing.  And what is the computer doing exactly?  Measuring the individual concordance word frequency the vocabulary of the works.  And all the while it is spitting out these reports.  And I saw the totals at the bottom. So ...  Now first of all the woman wrote 80 detective novels which is just amazing in and of itself. The computer found that her use of language was relatively consistent and normal for the first 72 of those books. But something happened on book number 73. Something drastic.  What?  Suddenly her use of words like ...  Words like thing anything something nothing.  What Ian calls indefinite words.  These words increased six times.  But also when the computer added up the vocabulary size of that book?  That is how many different words are there in the first 50000 words of a text?  It found in this book there were 20 percent fewer different words.  That is astounding. That is one-fifth of her vocabulary lost.  It gradually dawned on him that what he might be seeing was the very beginning stages of an author losing herself.  She had developed Alzheimer's. I delayed publishing my results for two years. I had to have the results analyzed by a computational linguist and a statistician.  And in her lifetime was she ever actually diagnosed?  Absolutely not. There was no diagnosis.  He said that some of her biographers suspected that something was up in her later years.  At one point apparently she cut off all her hair. She was not doing very well in interviews.  As far as we know she was never taken to a doctor. Never got diagnosed.  I think her family closed around her and protected her. I realized that I was seeing something about the human mind. I was seeing the author in the text in a way that people had not seen the author in the text before.  Which raised a question for me and I think this can apply to anyone. We all write a bazillion emails a day. I have got a decade's worth of my computer. Does that stuff hold clues about what we will be? Like early warning signs?  I think it is possible it does yes. And it is well worth doing research about how a loss of vocabulary can be determined let us say in one's email over five or six years.  Indications are he says that those clues are there. Not only that they may actually be there practically from the beginning.  A very famous example is the so-called nun study.  Okay the nun study actually began in 1990.  This is Dr. Kelvin Lim. He works at the University of Minnesota and is the current director of the so-called nun study. And this study more than any other that we know really makes the point about the predictive power of the words we choose. The study began with a guy named David Snowden who wanted to look at aging over time. So he chose nuns because he wanted a group that was healthy.  For example they do not smoke they do not drink.  They all have similar lifestyles.  They obviously have not had children.  So he approached this one particular order in Connecticut.  Called The School Sisters of Notre Dame.  And he signed up just short of 700 nuns. And the only stipulation being ...  You had to be at least 75 years of age. And so we are now 20 years into the study so that means the youngest of the sisters is about 95.  Yeah I think I am. I am the youngest.  And you are 94 years old?  Yes sir.  Not 95.  Not 95.   This is Sister Alberta Sheridan.  I like the way you said that.  Do you happen to know who the oldest remaining sister in the study is?  Wait a minute. Now the one who was buried today Jad was 101. I think she was the oldest one in the study.  Wow!  In our province yes.  The study began innocently enough she says. The researchers would show up to the convent every year give the nuns a bunch of tests.  Like mostly for memory. Just questioning back and forth.  And then over the years as the nuns passed awaywhich many of them have at this point ...  They have all gone Jad.  Of the original 678 sisters ...  At this point. We have approximately 40 sisters still alive and participating in the study.  And I am the only one left here in the Wilton Province.  And as the nuns would pass away the researchers had arranged it so that they would get a small piece of their brains.  Yes.  Which they could examine for plaques and tangles.  Now this morning we buried a sister here I told you. But the funeral was delayed a bit because she had to be taken to the hospital to have a portion of her brain removed to further the study.  Oh!  Mm-hmm.    Okay so here's why I bring this study up because of an accident that happened pretty early on that changed everything in the study. David Snowden the main dude was in the convent archives and he was talking to the archivist. The archivist says to him Hey you know all these nuns that you are studying who right now are over the age of 75? I actually have the essays that they wrote right when they got here.  And they did this roughly at about age 18.  Like 60 years before?  Oh yes. Oh yeah.  Right.  I have a copy of it at home.   Oh that is great. Come on in Naomi.  Thank you so much.  We actually asked a reporter Naomi Starobin to visit Sister Alberta at her home in Connecticut and have her read her essay that is now 76 years old.  Yeah good. Two days after the birth of the Christ child I was brought as a belated Christmas gift to a Mr. and Mrs. Albert Joseph Sheridan of Providence Rhode Island. A week later the sparkly waters of baptism were poured over me. I am not gonna read all this silly stuff thatwhen I first entered.  Why not?  It sounds kind of saccharin. I was only a teenager when I wrote.  But here's the thing when the researchers found the essays like the one you just heard it was a gold mine.  It was a major major find.  So they analyzed the essays looking primarily at ...  ... two specific features of the language that was contained in these narratives.  That is Serguei Pakhomov. He does the analysis for the current nun study.  In particular they looked at the notion of grammatical complexity and idea density.  What is idea density? What does that mean?  Idea density is a measure that looks at how many basic units of meaning are contained in any given utterance divided by the total number of words in that utterance.  In other words ...  The date of my birth is December 27.  Like if you were to listen to Sister Alberta's autobiography ...  When I was 11 years of age my dear mother was called to God.  It is the number of little discrete ideas she is able to cram into one sentence.  This was to be a turning point in my life as I had always had the ardent desire to become a sister.  Here's a classic example of the difference between low and high idea density. Here's low.  From Sister Helen. I was born in Eau Claire Wisconsin on May 24 1913 and was baptized in St. James Church.  Okay that is low. Now here's high.  From Sister Emma. It was about a half hour before midnight between February 28 and 29 of the leap year 1912 when I began to live and to die as the third child of my mother whose maiden name is Hilda Hoffman and my father Otto Schmidt.  I gotta say I am liking the first one.  Jad probably you as a journalist is seeing the first one as straight to the point.  Yeah. It is good writing.  And the second one seems kind of embellished.  A little bit yeah.  But here's the punch line of all this it turns out that the people who when they were 18 wrote in that journalistically very precise low idea density sort of way those people 60 years later were vastly vastly more likely to develop dementia. In fact based on those essays alone the researchers could predict with about 85 percent accuracy what the nuns' brains would look like when they died and were able to look at the brains. I mean would the brains have plaques and tangles that you associate with Alzheimer's or would they not?    What?  I mean that is just crazy.  Wait. Why?  It is backwards reasoning. But we will see we will see. I am justsuddenly I am suspicious. Here's a man who from what you just said has found the ones who got sick and working backwards found certain incidences of this that or the other and says Ah this is a cause that produces this effect.  No no no no. There is no cause and effect here.  These studies are demonstrating associations right? They are not demonstrating causality.  Right?  It is a very important distinction.  This is just a correlation okay?  But you know that maybe one of 190 correlations that produce people who get Alzheimer's in the end.  Yeah. I mean yeah. I mean but let me argue your case actually from a different angle. Like would this kind of linguistic analysis actually be relevant in the age of Twitter where everything is short and clipped?  Well people who Twitter do not only Twitter. They might also write small short dense essays for their ...  Yeah butwell you know I guess you are right. It is like it is mostly about the thoughts in your head not so much what you write.  Well so what about Agatha Christie? Was there a conclusion about Agatha?  Yeah there was.  Agatha Christie writing Elephants Can Remember.  This brings us back to Ian Lancashire and that 73rd book of Agatha Christie's that he analyzed and found that our vocabulary dipped. Well before he did the analysis he picked up that book and gave it a read. And like most people who read it did not like it.  Initially I thought it was very poorly written badly plotted full of errors of time of dating. Terrible read. Then I realized when I looked at the title Elephants Can Remember ...  He realized that maybe Agatha Christie sensed what was happening to her.  She was responding to that truism that elephants never forget. The chief character is an aging female novelist named Ariadne who is a foil for Agatha herself. And sheAriadneis suffering from memory loss.  In the story she tries to help a detective solve this crime but she has trouble because she keeps forgetting.  And the last sentence in that novel in fact is Agatha saying Well maybe it is okay not to remember.  Wow.  She was trying to defend herself defend her sense that she was forgetting she was losing her vocabulary she was losing her language. I began to see that Christie was heroic still writing despite this handicap.  Yeah.  And her willingness to do that at an age of 81 82 struck me as heroic in a way.  I understand that. The muse would not quit but the tools all left the room.  Yeah. I think we should leave the room.  Okay.   Copyright  2021 New York Public Radio. All rights reserved.
