 My mother has a huge family. And every year they have a family reunion and she is always trying to get me to go. Come on let us go let us go let us go let us go. I have not gone since I was a little kid. Finally she wore me down. All right let us go. It was getting our family reunion on you know bean-bagging and horseshoes this is a three-day affair. And my mama said look look here. You have got a cousin that lived up in Malaysia. And you lived in Malaysia I want you to go talk to her right away. She is right over the hill get over there. All right how you doing? What is going on ? And she is like I do not speak none of that nonsense. My mom tells me you lived in Malaysia did you have a good time over there? Better still I got a question for you. Have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior?   Well you know what? My religion is kind of complicated. And you know I am just live-and-let-live right now we are just in the middle of this family reunion. I asked you a question. Have you accepted the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior? It was real nice meeting you I am going to go stand over here now. And she said . What? Excuse me what did you say? . Hey hey hey hey hey are you speaking in tongues at me? I do not appreciate people speaking up in tongues at me. . Please stop speaking in tongues at me. . 'ecause guess what? Guess what? You as not the only one that can speak in tongues. I gave right back as good as I got. . And she is getting it. . And you got to understand speaking in tongues around my family is like hitting the 911 button. People came - it is an emergency. People came quick running top speed. What is going on? And I am the obvious interloper. So they start speaking in tongues helping out. And the force is strong with them. The force is strong. So they are pushing me back right? . I was finally - I know I got to give up and go so I start running back over the hill. I am running over there at top speed myself.
