Heather and her girlfriend live with a cat named Sid. The girlfriend was always inventing these cute little affectionate nicknames for Sid but never did that for Heather. She was always praising Sid and asking Heather to praise Sid but never gave that kind of approval to Heather. If anything she was kind of detached when it came to Heather. So even though Sid was just a cat against her will against her better judgment Heather started to get jealous. I remember that I would sort of wake up in the morning and I would hear her saying things like you are so beautiful. You are a princess. Look at you. And you know as I opened my eyes I realized that she was talking not to me but to the cat.   You felt like the third wheel. Mm-hmm. You know I know if there had been another woman I would have compared myself to her physically sort of what does she look like? What kinds of things is my girlfriend attracted to that I could aspire to? You know what personality traits. Is she funny? You know but there was just-- I did not know what it was about Sid. I mean I could see that she was attractive as a cat and I could see that she had this nonchalance that was beautiful. You know she did not seem to care really that she was loved. So those were things that I did think about really-- cultivating even. But-- You thought that cultivating a nonchalance and-- You know that I was this concerned about it shows you that it would have been a you know a fake. But yeah I mean I thought about cultivating it like that. Since our pets win our love they can also activate all the other feelings that can go with love-- jealousy and anger and dependence and just everything else. And as soon as any one of those feelings kicks in all the complicated dynamics that happen between any people in any household any family all of those also inevitably kick in. And that is what happened with Heather and Sid the cat. I felt sort of the same way I felt-- you know how when you have a crush on someone and then you are friends with their significant other and all the awkwardness as you pretend that you know you sort of do not have the feelings that you do for this other person. I sort of felt like Sid was the significant other of the person you know for whom I had feelings. And so I felt awkward around Sid and I felt like I had to-- I do not know. I felt like they were together before I was around and I was an interloper. You know all the awkwardness surrounding that. And so what is it like to be in a love triangle with another woman and a cat? Well it was pretty you know diminishing. I mean it was a beautiful cat.   From WBEZ Chicago it is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Today on our program In Dog We Trust stories of dogs and cats and other pets and how they get caught up in our family dynamics as non-speaking members of our households. Our program today in three acts. Act 1 The Youth in Asia in which writer David Sedaris describes how a Great Dane-- and not a very smart one-- was able to completely replace him and his sisters when they grew up and moved out of their parents' house. Act 2 Polly Wants So Much More Than a Cracker. Three small children who love their mom but do not love their mom's pet bird. Act 3 Resurrection. What it means in a family when a pet armadillo dies and what it means when it does not die. Stay with us.   Act 1 The Youth In Asia. So when a pet dies to what degree can it be replaced by another pet? And to what degree can pets replace people in our lives? Well David Sedaris has this story. In the early 1960s during what my mother referred to as the tail end of the Lassie years my parents were given two collies which they named Rastus and Duchess. We were living then in New York State out in the country and the dogs were free to race through the forest. They napped in meadows and stood knee-deep in frigid streams co-stars in their own private dog food commercial. Late one January evening while lying on a blanket in the garage Duchess gave birth to a litter of slick potato-sized puppies. When it looked as though one of them had died our mother placed the creature in a casserole dish and popped it into the oven like the witch in Hansel and Gretel. Oh keep your shirts on she said. It is only set on 150. I am not baking anyone. This is just to keep it warm. The heat revived the sick puppy and left us believing that our mother was capable of resurrecting the dead. Faced with the responsibilities of fatherhood Rastus took off. The puppies were given away and we moved south where the heat and humidity worked against the best interests of a collie. Duchess's once beautiful coat now hung in ragged patches. When finally full of worms she collapsed in the ravine beside our house we re-evaluated our mother's healing powers. The entire animal kingdom was beyond her scope. She could only resurrect the cute dead. The oven trick was performed on half a dozen dazed and chubby hamsters but failed to work on my first guinea pig who died after eating four cigarettes and an entire pack of matches. Do not take it too hard my mother said removing her oven mitts. The world is full of guinea pigs. You can get another one tomorrow. Eulogies tended to be brief our motto being there is always more where this one came from. A short time after Duchess died our father came home with a German shepherd puppy. For reasons that were never fully explained the privilege of naming the dog went to a friend of my older sister's a 14-year-old girl named Cindy. She was studying German at the time. And after carefully examining the puppy and weighing it with her hands she announced that it would be called Madchen which apparently meant girl in what she referred to as Deutsch. When she was six months old Madchen was hit and killed by a car. Her food was still in the bowl when our father brought home an identical German shepherd. The same Cindy christened as Madchen II. This tag team progression was disconcerting especially for the new dog who was expected to possess both the knowledge and the personality of her predecessor. Madchen I would never have wet on the floor like that my father would scold and the dog would sigh knowing she was the canine equivalent of a rebound. Madchen II never accompanied us to the beach and rarely posed in any of the family photographs. Once her puppyhood was spent we more or less lost interest. We ought to get a dog we would sometimes say completely forgetting that we already had one. During the era of the Madchens we had a succession of drowsy secretive cats who seemed to share a unique bond with our mother. It is because I open their cans she said. Though we all knew it ran deeper than that. What they had in common were their claws. That and a deep-seated need to destroy my father's golf bags. The first cat passed into a disagreeable old age and died hissing at the kitten who had prematurely arrived to replace her. When at the age of nine the second cat was diagnosed with feline leukemia my mother was devastated. I am going to have Sadie put to sleep she said. It is for her own good and I do not want to hear a word about it from any of you. This is hard enough as it is. The cat was put down and then came the anonymous postcards and phone calls orchestrated by my sisters and I. The cards announced a miraculous new cure for feline leukemia while the callers identified themselves as representatives of Cat Fancy magazine. We would like to use Sadie as our cover story and we are hoping to schedule a photo shoot. Is tomorrow possible? After spending a petless year with only one child still living at home my parents visited a breeder and returned with a Great Dane they named Melina. They loved this dog in proportion to its size and soon their hearts had no room for anyone else. In terms of family their six children had been nothing more than a failed experiment. Melina was the real thing. The dog was their first true common interest and they loved it equally each in their own way. Our mother's love tended towards the horizontal a pet being little more than a napping companion something she could look at and say that looks like a good idea. Scoot over why do not you. A stranger peeking through the window might think that the two of them had entered a suicide pact. She and the dog sprawled like corpses their limbs arranged into an eternal embrace. My father loved the Great Dane for its size and frequently took her on long aimless drives during which she would stick her heavy anvil-sized head out the window and leak great quantities of foamy saliva . Other drivers pointed and stared rolling down their windows to shout hey you got a saddle for that thing? When out for a walk there was the inevitable are you walking her or is it the other way around? Our father always laughed as if this were the first time he would heard it. The attention was addictive and he enjoyed a pride of accomplishment he would never felt with any of us. It was as if he were somehow responsible for her size and stature as if he would personally designed her spots and trained her to grow to the size of a pony. When out with the dog he carried a leash in one hand and a shovel in the other. Just in case he said. Just in case what she dies and you need to bury her? I did not get it. No he would say. It is for-- you know it is for her business. My father was retired but the dog had business. I was living in Chicago when they first got Melina and every time I came home the animal was bigger. Every time there were more Marmaduke cartooms displayed upon the refrigerator. And every time my voice grew louder as I asked myself who are these people? Down girl my parents would chuckle as the puppy jumped up panting for my attention. Her great padded paws reached my waist then my chest and shoulders until eventually her arms wrapped around my neck and her head towering above my own she came to resemble a dance partner scouting the room for a better offer. That is just her way of saying hello my mother would say handing me the towel used to wipe up the dog's bubbling seepage. Here you missed a spot on the back of your head. The dog's growth was monitored on a daily basis and every small accomplishment was documented for later generations. One can find two pictures of my sister Tiffany while Melina has entire volumes devoted to her Terrible Twos. Hit me my mother said on one of my returns home from Chicago. No wait let me go get my camera. She left the room and returned a few moments later. OK she said now hit me. Better yet why do not you just pretend to hit me. I raised my hand and my mother cried out in pain. Ow she yelled somebody help me. This stranger is trying to hurt me and I do not know why. I caught an advancing blur moving in from the left and the next thing I knew I was down on the ground the Great Dane tearing holes in the neck of my sweater. The camera flashed and my mother squealed with delight. God I love that trick. I rolled over to protect my face. This is not a trick. My mother snapped another picture. Oh do not be so critical. It is close enough. With us grown and out of the house my sisters and I foolishly expected our parents' lives to stand still. They were supposed to stagnate and live in the past but instead they constructed a new we consisting of Melina and the founding members of her fan club. Someone who obviously did not know her too well had given my mother a cheerful stuffed bear with a calico heart stitched onto its chest. According to the manufacturer the bear's name was Mumbles and all it needed in order to thrive were two AA batteries and a regular diet of hugs. Where is Mumbles my mother would ask and the dog would jump up and snatch the bear from its hiding place on top of the refrigerator yanking it this way and that in hopes of breaking its neck. That is my girl my mother would say. We do not like Mumbles do we? I learned that we liked Morley Safer but not Mike Wallace that we did not like Mumbles or thunder but we are crazy about Stan Getz records and the Iranian couple who'd moved in up the street. It was difficult to keep straight but having known these people all my life I did not want to be left out of the we. During the final years of Madchen II and the first half of the Melina epoch I lived with a female cat named Neil. My mother looked after the cat when I moved from Raleigh and flew her to Chicago once I would found a place and settled in. Neil was old when she moved to Chicago and then she got older. She started leaving teeth in her bowl and developed the sort of breath that could remove paint. When she stopped cleaning herself I took to bathing her in the sink and she would stand still too weak to resist the humiliation of shampoo. Soaking wet I could see just how thin and brittle she really was almost comic like one of those cartoon cats checking her fur coat at the cloakroom of the seafood restaurant. Her kidneys shrank to the size of raisins and though I loved her very much I assumed the vet was joking when he suggested dialysis. I took her for a second opinion. Vet number two tested her blood and phoned me at home saying perhaps you should think about euthanasia. I had not heard that word in a while and pictured scores of happy Japanese children spilling from the front door of their elementary school. Are you thinking about it he asked? Yes I said as a matter of fact I am. In the end I returned to the animal hospital and had her put to sleep. When the vet injected the sodium phenobarbital Neil fluttered her eyes assumed a apt position and died. A week after putting her to sleep I received Neil's ashes in a forest green can. She would never expressed any great interest in the outdoors so I scattered her remains on the carpet-- --and then vacuumed her back up. The cat's death struck me as the end of an era. It was of course the end of her era. But with the death of a pet there is always that urge to crowd the parentheses and string black crape over an entire 10- or 20-year period. The end of my safe college life the last of my 30-inch waist my faltering relationship with my first real boyfriend. I cried for it all and spent the next several months wondering why so few songs were written about cats. My mother sent a consoling letter along with a check to cover the cost of the cremation. In the left-hand corner under the heading marked memo she would written pet burning. I had it coming. When my mother died Melina took over her side of the bed. Due to their size Great Danes generally do not live very long. My father massaged her arthritic legs carried her up the stairs and lifted her into bed. He treated her the way that men in movies treat their ailing wives the way he would have treated my mother had she allowed such naked displays of affection. Melina's parentheses contained the final 10 years of his married life. She would attended my father's retirement lived through my sister's wedding and knew who everyone was talking about when they mentioned the M words-- Mom Mumbles and Morley Safer. Regardless of her pain my father could not bear to let her go. The youth in Asia begged him to end her life.  they said.  But he held out until the last minute. A month after Melina died my father returned to the breeder and came home with another Great Dane a female like Melina gray spots like Melina only this one is named Sophie. He tries to love her but readily admits that he may have made a mistake. She is a nice enough dog but the timing is off. When walking the puppy through the neighborhood my father feels not unlike the foolish widower stumbling behind his energetic young bride. Her stamina embarrasses him as does her interest in younger men. The passing drivers slow to a stop and roll down their windows. Hey they yell are you walking her or is it the other way around? Their words remind him of happier times of milder forces straining against the well-worn leash. He still gets the attention. But now in response he just lifts his shovel and groans. David Sedaris. This story The Youth in Asia is in his book Me Talk Pretty One Day. A version of the story also appeared in Esquire magazine. You can catch David on tour all over the country starting in April.

When she was 17 she saw a bird in a pet store a macaw which is kind of a big parrot-- brightly colored with a three-foot wingspan. And I fell in love with her immediately. And you know I was still in high school. I had no money whatsoever. How expensive was she? Well the price tag on the cage said 1400 which was an inordinate amount of money. So how long did it take you to pay off the bird? It took me about five years to pay her off working part-time jobs babysitting. And what did you love about her? What was the thing that drew you to her? I find it hard to say exactly why I was drawn to her. I thought she was the most beautiful thing I would ever seen. It is hard to describe how it feels to love an animal. But as soon as I saw her face I just thought she was the most beautiful thing and I had to have her and I wanted to see that face every day and I wanted to care for her. And I did not know anything about bringing up parrots or feeding them or caring for them. I just wanted to take her home like a big-- like a treasure. OK. Fast-forward 23 years.   When we first broadcast this story Veronica was 40 years old married with two twin boys Kyle and Cameron aged five and another boy Daniel who was eight. One of the things she did not know about parrots when she first saw her macaw is that they can live for 80 years-- 80. So every morning she would take the bird whose name is Gideon out of her cage so she could freely wander the house. And get into things she should not get into like a baby-- climbing into laundry baskets and ripping up clothes and taking the kids' Pokemon cards and ripping them to shreds and pulling newspapers out of boxes. And so at breakfast you have got three little kids there. The kids will interact with each other. And Gideon will scream as loud as she can over their heads. Now let us play a recording of Gideon for people at home.     It sounds really loud. It is intolerable. It is a sound that you do not want to hear. It sounds very dinosaur-like. Yeah. Well--   The word you just used was intolerable? It is the most unpleasant sound I think I have ever heard. But you have lived with this sound for 23 years. I have lived with that sound for 23 years. It is in my dreams. It is wherever I go. It is in the kitchen. It is in the dining room. It is in my bedroom. And the kids have grown up with her. So they will not really notice it at first. But after about the fourth or fifth scream they will start covering their ears and shouting back at the bird.  You stop it please?  Mommy will you take me and put her in the tree? Now you tape little interviews with your kids about Gideon. Here's Cameron who is five. Do you like having Gideon in the family? Not really. Would you rather that she went somewhere else? Yeah. All the way to Sco-- to England. Because I do not want her to scream when we are watching TV. Would you rather have a different kind of pet than Gideon? Yeah. A dog that is really nice and does not bite and does not bark. But do you understand why mommy loves Gideon? No. This is Kyle the other twin also five. One time she just almost bited off my thumb. That kind of scared me. They are terrified of Gideon. If they are approached by her they will immediately scream and run away. They will not go near her now. And is that because Gideon is in fact a little dangerous? They are right to be a little scared? Well Gideon's primary objective in life is to be my mate. And so every other person or creature that comes near me is a threat to our relationship. And my children are a very big threat to our relationship because we have physical contact with each other. She sees me carrying them and cooking for them and touching them and picking them up. And so she has a desire to kill them basically. I mean in the bird world she would kill another predator or some intrusive love interest. Now after your kids were born and you saw how Gideon reacted to your children and you saw how your children reacted to Gideon-- they were scared that Gideon bit Kyle-- did it change your feelings about Gideon? I do not think anything can change my feelings about Gideon. But if I had a dog that I loved and then I had a new baby in the house and the dog was hostile towards the baby I would not feel the same way about the dog. I would feel protective of my kid which I am sure you did. Well I do feel protective of the children and I take certain steps to protect them from her but I cannot stop loving her because of her natural tendency to want to drive away competition. As I said this is a love story and that Veronica knows Gideon is driving everybody else who she loves crazy. She loves the bird. The same monogamous feelings that make Gideon mean to everyone else make Gideon fantastically sweet to Veronica. Gideon watches her every move cuddles with her blushes. Gideon actually blushes when they play together. She is all that Gideon lives for and it is hard to turn away from that.   Thank you Gideon. Veronica also worries that if she gave the bird away the bird would die. They mate so fiercely that sometimes when their mate vanishes that can happen.  I know Gideon it is upsetting.  And then there is this story. When Veronica was 18 and barely owned Gideon for a year she took Gideon outside like she did every day. And Gideon flew away. Veronica had not been careful enough clipping her feathers. She was wrecked. Every night Veronica cried herself to sleep. Every day she sat on the roof watching the skies. After six days a kid on his way to school spotted the bird. And I quickly ran to where he said she was. And I saw her in probably the tallest tree and immediately scaled the tree got all the way to the top. I was up about 50 feet. She was on the end of the branch all the way out. And so I inched my way out. And about 34 of the way out-- I was only a foot away from her-- the branch snapped. And I fell straight down without hitting anything on the way. And just fell 50 feet and landed on my feet on hard ground. And I suffered a multiple compression fracture of my spine and I had a collapsed lung. I should have died according to the orthopedic surgeon. Do you think the fact that you nearly died trying to save Gideon is one of the things that makes it impossible for you to give Gideon up? That is something I have thought about. Yeah it is quite possible. I feel like it is brought us closer. It is not a pleasant thing that happened but I feel like she would have died out there. You say that it brought us closer but you are the only one who actually understands that you went out and you got injured trying to save Gideon. Gideon does not understand that. No she does not understand that but I know she understands something. She is very bonded to me. She became so close to me at one point that her hormones produced an egg. And that is something that happens only between couples. So I know she feels something. I do not really need to know much more than that. In the end I think this is only partly a story about Veronica's love for Gideon. It is also a story about her family's love for her that they put up with the bird. We all want to believe that the people who love us will at least accept the parts of us that are not so appealing. And in Veronica's case the unappealing part just happens to have physical form and be a bird. Every day that her kids and her husband put up with that they prove to her just how much they love her. I just do not know why you had to buy her. How much bucks was she? She cost a lot of money. Like how much money? She cost like 1400. Whoa just for a parrot? Why would they do that? Hi.   The most remarkable thing I think about the phrase I love you is how rarely it is used literally to mean I love you that I have a feeling of love for you. It is used much more often I think to mean 100 other things. Tell me that you love me. Or I need to get off the phone now. Or things are fine between us right? Or yes it is fine that we keep the parrot.          Coming up one of the best known stories from the bible re-enacted with an armadillo sort of. And what animal takes a licking and keeps on ticking? Answers in a minute when our program continues. It is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Each week on our program of course we choose some theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today's program In Dog We Trust-- stories of pets and the ways they function as actual members of our families and affect family dynamics. We first broadcast this show years ago. We have arrived at Act Three of our program. Act Three Resurrection. So earlier in today's show David Sedaris talked about animals that his mom could and could not bring back to life. This is another story about what it is that animals can take the place of in our lives and in our homes. It is a piece of fiction from writer Brady Udall. It was three days after our old man died that my brother Donald accomplished the most spectacular deed of his life. I wish I could have been there to see it. Donald taking the Greyhound down to Nogales all by himself buying the baby armadillo for 800 pesos from a pie-faced Indian woman at the  market tucking the little thing under his arm like a football and running the length of the pedestrian border station-- past the heat-struck tourists in their sombreros and loud socks and the guards with their sidearms and walkie-talkies pushing through the last steel-toothed turnstile and sprinting like a madman into the heart of the Nogales slums.   It was his proudest moment though it did take him the rest of the day and half the night of wandering among the hookers and street corner punks to find a bus that would bring him back to Aho where we lived. There he was after I came home from hours of frantic searching sitting stiff-backed on the couch beaming. The little armadillo was rooting at the crotch of his pants and Donald's pink sweating face had screwed itself up with such a grin of utter self-satisfaction. Donald ended up giving the armadillo to me. A present he said something to make me feel better. I thanked him took the armadillo which clawed at my T-shirt like a cat and gave it a little squeeze. What else could I do?   My father had worked as a janitor for 21 years. But he was also a reader of books a scholar if it is possible to be both a scholar and a sixth grade dropout. And one of his favorite subjects was zoology. He could bore you into a coma with what he knew about the great horned owl or the common mealworm or the laughing hyenas of Africa. But of all the beasts of the animal kingdom he loved and admired the humble armadillo most. Nope not the smartest or the prettiest he would say when one of them scattered across the highway in front of our old LeMans. But the hardiest you see what I am saying the most resourceful. He often promised he would get us an armadillo for a pet but he died before he could come through-- an end-all heart attack standing in line at the grocery store. I was 17 Donald 19. Our mother a Guatemalan migrant worker who had married my father under the impression he would one day be a rich man who could buy her a Cadillac and a house with a swimming pool had run off when we were babies. So it was just the two of us now. It took me about a week to get over the shock and then I did what I had to. I dropped out of school started working full time pouring concrete for Hasenpfeffer's and moved Donald and me to a cheaper apartment near the  and Sons wrecking yard where Donald could watch the cars getting pulverized from our window. We got money from the state that paid for Donald's medication but the rest was up to me.  Donald was really something else. What could be done with a guy who ate his own earwax who carried a maroon mini bible in the band of his underpants and read random scriptures out loud at inappropriate times? Who could be sashaying about the room one minute doing a dead-on impression of Sammy Davis Jr. and the next be downstairs in the closet grunting like a pig and trying to tear his hair out? From a distance you would not have been able to tell him from any other teenager. He had relatively good hygiene did not usually talk to himself in public and was something of a handsome devil with his dark hair hanging down over pale green eyes. Sometimes I would take him to a party or a dance with me and the girls would flock around us. He could be as charming as Hugh Hefner in short bursts before he would have to run off and hide in the bathroom.   I remember once when I was nine or 10 and we were playing in the back yard. He kept pestering me saying I am the Indian. You are the cowboy. OK? I told him to shut his trap. I was busy building a cave for my army men. He would not give up. Me Indian you cowboy. Okey-dokey? Over and over. Damn it Donald you freak I hollered. Do whatever you want but just shut up for a second. I am not a freak he said sticking his chin out. All right then I said. The next time I looked up Donald was on top of the doghouse with a bow and arrow set my father had bought for him at a garage sale. He had the arrow notched and pulled back to his ear just like the Indians we saw on TV. I had not noticed before but now I saw that he had taken off his shirt and tucked it in the elastic of his shorts so it looked like he was wearing a loincloth and had used a little blood from the scab on his elbow to make fiendish red streaks across his face. He was doing it perfect really just like a TV Indian. I did not believe he would really shoot me so I just sat there like a jackass my hands full of dirt. I did not see him let go of the bowstring but I certainly did hear the fop the arrow made when it hit me in the chest dead center. More from the surprise than anything I fell flat on my back. It was only a target arrow but it pierced my sternum just enough to stand up right from my chest waving around sluggishly like a reed in a river. I lay in the grass and stared up at the neon yellow fletching of the arrow. My hands were still full of dirt. Donald jumped down from the doghouse and stood over me. He was smiling an odd satisfied smile as if he was expecting to be congratulated on his marksmanship. He looked down at me for a long time before he gently put his hand around the shaft of the arrow without pulling it out. He said right smack dab in the heart white man.   I told Donald I wanted him to name the armadillo. After several days of deliberation he decided to name it after Otis the happy drunk on The Andy Griffith Show who our father had resembled in almost eerie detail. I would gotten used to taking care of Donald alone. I had no choice. But Otis was a different story. First of all Otis smelled. He gave off a musky odor that intensified whenever he was nervous or hungry. And no matter if we scrubbed him raw with industrial soap and water the smell would come back in an hour or so. And then there was the furniture. Armadillos are burrowing animals. This is something I learned from my father. And in the confines of our small apartment Otis did not have many opportunities to burrow. Instead he would march through the house like a tiny gray tank and move the furniture around. He would waddle into the living room put his blunt forehead against one of the legs of the coffee table and bear down inching it around the room his little squirrel claws scrabbling on the wood floor. At least once a week he would crawl between the mattress and box springs of my bed and take a dump. My father was right about armadillos. They are hardy they are resourceful-- and if Otis is typical they are as dumb as donkey crap. Sometimes in the course of his incessant apartment wandering Otis would find himself trapped in a corner and would spend the rest of the evening attempting to claw his way out.   Otis was technically my pet. But Donald cared for him worried over and tormented and teased him then made up with tearful professions of regret and affection. While I was away at work they would do things together. Donald would carry Otis around outside conversing with him rooting in the weeds in the vacant lot searching for earthworms or crickets for Otis's dinner. Sometimes Donald would hide behind the recliner and when Otis passed by would jump out and shout in a high soprano wail Look out Otis! Poor Otis would spring two feet into the air like a startled cat his leathery body twisti
