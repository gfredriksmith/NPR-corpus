Hi everybody. I am speaking to you today from the stage of an opera house at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City.   A warning to listeners that there is mild cursing throughout this hour and on the podcast we are not going to beep that. And I am here on an opera house stage with a story that is so small it almost feels wrong to tell it in a room this grand. It is actually about a real opera singer-- not a super-famous opera singer or anything like that. Carin Gilfry makes about half of her living singing. The other half she makes recording audio books. And about a year ago she was staying at a hotel. And she had a deadline on this children's book that she was supposed to be recording and the hotel room was kind of noisy. She was hearing a lot of noise from the street. And so she looked around for a quiet place and she went into the closet-- put pillows all around to deaden the sound sat on the floor with a microphone. And then the cord of the microphone went under the door of the closet out to her laptop because her laptop had a fan that made noise. And so she closes the door so it is pitch dark except for the light from her iPad which had the text of the book that she was supposed to read. And she began. The Exciting Exploits of an Effervescent Elf written by Trisha Sugarek and narrated by Carin Gilfry. Chapter one Where is Emma? The enchanted forest was deep and green and splashed with-- Can I just say would not it be incredible if I just now played you the entire audiobook? You paid like 85 for those seats right? Actually I cannot play you the whole audiobook because Carin gets exactly like two and a half sentences into this book. And she stumbles on a word and she decides oh wait I will just start again. I will just start from the beginning. So she gets up to get out of the closet and start the tape again start the recording again. And she tries to get out of the closet.   Oh . And she discovers that she is locked in. . Oh my god. Seriously? And Carin told me at first she thought like this is not going to be that hard right? After all she has the iPad. There is Wi-Fi. She could call the front desk on Skype right? But there was a problem. This Wi-Fi was like half of one bar and it kept just cutting out. But I found the hotel number. This of course is on the recording. 212-661-9600.  I dialed it.   Thank you for calling the Roosevelt Hotel. Please listen carefully to the following options. For additional information about the hotel please visit our website-- And then of course it is like the longest hotel phone menu ever. --for sales and catering services press 3. For accounting press 4. For the human resources office press 5. I am trying to press 0 to get to the operator. And I am thinking the Wi-Fi is going to cut out at any moment. So I am listening to this giant long menu and finally I hear-- If at any time you wish to speak to an operator press 8.  So I press 8.   Reservations. May speaking. May I assist you? Hi I am actually in room 1136. Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me?     After that there is seven minutes of silence on the recording-- just like total silence. Nothing happens except every now and then Carin just laughs to herself. It happens one minute and 48 seconds after the phone call. Then it is quiet. There is no other sound for 44 seconds. And then on the recording you hear--  Now and then she tries the door handle again thinking she told me later this cannot really be true. Like this cannot-- there is got to be a way this is going to work. One wall of the closet has the hallway on the other side. And 18 minutes after Carin locks herself in she hears people. She hears some German tourists walking towards her down the hall. And fortunately she actually has the skills for this very situation.  Can someone help me? The Germans come to the door of the room. They whisper to each other for a little bit. And then they do nothing. Hello? Her husband is out on an audition-- he is also a singer-- and his phone was turned off. She texts her mom hears nothing back. She phones her mom. And right then somebody taps on the door of the hotel room and calls through it. Are you OK? Yes! Please come in! Can you come to the door? the person asks. I cannot. I am-- I am stuck in the closet.   Hello? Where are you? In the closet right here. Oh thank you.  I am an audiobook narrator-- Oh OK. --and I was trying to narrate a book. Good. Oh-- Oh my god. Carin knows that is a really weird thing to say to somebody as you are getting rescued but she just could not help herself. Nobody wants to look like a nut you know? Apparently the Germans went and they found this very sweet Jamaican housekeeper. And 22 minutes after Carin was locked in the housekeeper set her free. God I was so happy to see her. And she was so nice. Oh my gosh she was so nice. I know this is a weird question but is it appropriate to tip in a situation like that? I do not know. I did not think of it then. Now Carin remember she is an opera singer. And operas are all about spectacle. It is 80 people on the stage and horses and love and vengeance and big grand feelings. It would really be hard to get further from that to what happened to her in that closet right where all the action takes place in a space not much bigger than your body. It is the simplest plot imaginable. There is literally no movement in this plot. If someone were to stage this as an opera how would that go? It might be minimalist music actually. Oh right. Like just a repeating theme over and over and over again with me yelling help! And you know people say those kinds of things in interviews and then I will put that quote at the end of the story. And it makes for a nice ending-- put a little plinky music under it. Maybe you have heard our show. But when we did this interview three or four weeks ago I realized oh wait a second. For once in my life I do not have to let this story stop here. I am actually going to be in an opera house very soon. I can reach higher with this. I can take this to the next logical step-- the step it never gets to the step you need an opera house for. And it turns out I actually have a hook-up for the kind of music that Carin is talking about. Some of you know this. I have a cousin. His name is Philip Glass. He has--   --written a number of minimalist operas. They have been performed here on this very stage since the 1980s-- Einstein on the Beach just this past fall. And so I called Philip and he sat down to write. And so today right now I am pleased to present here on the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House stage--   --the world premiere of his latest opera. I am not joking-- this opera is called Help. Commissioned for our program today on the BAM Opera House stage his work is played by orchestras all over the world please welcome Philip Glass.   And to perform this with him Jonathan Dinklage on violin Emily Brausa on cello and of course the woman this is all about Carin Gilfry mezzo-soprano. Carin?   SINGING Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help!   Carin Gilfry with Jonathan Dinklage Emily Brausa and Philip Glass.   Well from WBEZ Chicago it is This American Life distributed by Public Radio International. I am Ira Glass. Ladies and gentlemen for decades the Brooklyn Academy of Music has been a home for all sorts of new kinds of theater and dance and music and opera. And when they invited our program to perform here today we wanted to live up to that tradition by trying to invent something new. And so what you are in for today is true stories. It is journalism like we always do but presented as radio drama. And we think these are radio dramas like you have never heard before. We have journalism turned into opera into a full-on Broadway musical. We have journalism turned into a play that is structured like a radio documentary. The fact is there are so many ways you can tell a true story. There are so so many ways. And today instead of just applying the tools of journalism to everyday stories like we usually do we try to harness the full power of music and theater. Like Carin's story-- we are not done with Carin's story. Sure you could do it is as a minimalist opera. But what if you wanted to stage it as kind of an old-school opera-opera the kind that they take you on field trips to when you are a kid. Like what would that be? I asked Carin in our interview and she was game to speculate. Oh I do not know. I mean as a whole opera? I mean opera is long. Maybe the elves from the book would come and prance around and sing about the enchanted forest. That was the book I was narrating.  SINGING We are the elves from Carin's story. We are the elves from Carin's story. We are the elves from Carin's story. We are the elves from Carin's story. We are the elves from Carin's story. We are the elves from Carin's story. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. My name is Cheets. I am Violet . My name is Cheets. I am Violet. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves. We are the elves!   Of course you would need more than elves in this story. Like also you would want-- The people. The people walking around the closet. The German people. There could be you know a just got to New York aria sung in German.   Actually what they are singing is we have just arrived. The air is dirty and smoggy.     I do not know if you caught the German there. One of the tourists says I think someone called for help in German. And the other one says impossible-- everyone in this country is illiterate. Then there is the front desk lady-- you know the one that Carin calls from her iPad. Right. It could be funny if she was like oh my life is so boring. I just answer this phone all day and people ask for room service. You do a cutaway. I am stuck in the closet. And finally this is her big moment and she does not even know it.  SINGING Oh! It is so boring. It is boring as can be! It is boring to sit behind this desk. It is boring to be me! SINGING Hello? Are you there? Can you hear me? SINGING No one ever notices my radiant complexion. No one ever asks me for anything but directions.   Then there is the husband. In this version of the story we could actually see him out on his audition belting his heart out oblivious to the pain that his wife is going through. So maybe we could incorporate some kind of famous baritone aria. I wonder like what would be the most appropriate and ironic aria for him to be singing. Oh I do not know. Something about love I am sure. Or something about being a rescuer. We actually talked about what would be best. And we finally settled on a scene from Rigoletto where the title character who loves his daughter more than anything in the world rages against courtiers who have locked her up in a tiny room. Open up that door he sings. Open up.      God that was great. Carin will be so proud of me. Of course the climax of our opera arrives with the entrance of the housekeeper. What should she be like in the opera version of this story? Um gosh. I mean maybe she just rescues people all day. Maybe somebody's having a baby and she delivers a baby. And then she cleans up after it. Like she saves a guy who is out on the ledge. She gets him to come inside. Yeah.  SINGING What is it now? You have locked yourself in? I just delivered a baby in room 310 rescued a hostage extinguished a fire! It is time to retire. But first this little door's no match for me! One little push I will set you free!    SINGING I cannot believe-- SINGING She cannot believe-- SINGING I am free. SINGING She is free. SINGING Out of the closet. SINGING Out. SINGING And into the light. SINGING Her clothes are all the same. SINGING I do not get paid enough. I do not get paid enough.  SINGING Ah--         Seriously. True story. SINGING Ah!   Our opera En Schrank Gefangen or Trapped in the Closet was composed by Matt Aucoin music direction and keyboards by William Hobbs. It featured Rachel Feldsetin Candice Hoyes and Sarah Craft as elves Marnie Breckenridge as the front desk Adrian Rosas as the husband Jeanine de Bique as the housekeeper Rod Gilfry who is actually Karen's dad as the German tourist with Heather Buck and mezzo-soprano Carin Gilfry as herself.   Which brings us to act one. Act One 21 Chump Street the Musical. I have always wondered what it would mean to try one of our radio stories as a musical. I was taken to so many musicals as a kid. And I think because of that my basic sense of what makes a satisfying story actually comes from musicals much more than from TV or movies. If you think about like the classic old musicals-- Fiddler on the Roof or even A Chorus Line-- it is like they are funny at the beginning. And then there is something really emotional. And they are about some bigger idea. They take you into this world. I just love that. And so what you are about to hear is our first attempt at a musical based on journalism. Probably 70 to 80 of what you are about to hear is verbatim quotes from interviews. The rest is artistic invention. I will say that upfront. It is based on a true story you may remember from our radio program. Back in May 2011 at a bunch of high schools in Palm Beach County Florida a group of young police officers were sent undercover to pose as students. They went to classes. They ate in the cafeteria. They had fake Facebook accounts of course. There had been complaints about drugs being sold at these schools. That is what they were there to deal with. And what happened next in this one school was transformed into a musical by a team of people who usually do this on Broadway. Pretty much everybody involved in this the cast the chorus the musicians the director Michael Mayer-- all from Broadway. Words and music are by Lin-Manuel Miranda probably best known--   --probably best known for writing and starring in In the Heights. He will be your narrator.   The plan was called Operation D-minus. And one of the schools included in the plan was Park Vista Community High School where a kid named Justin Laboy-- SINGING That is me. --an 18-year-old honor roll student-- SINGING I get straight A's man. --was in the last semester of his senior year. Justin could hardly believe his luck when a very pretty girl showed up. SINGING Naomi! In not one but two of his classes. SINGING Naomi! She sat in front of him. He switched seats. SINGING Naomi! The last name she used was-- SINGING Rodriguez. Justin what drew you to Naomi initially? SINGING Man she used to fall asleep in class. She was a SINGING light-skinneded Puerto Rican-Dominican-- long hair mature in the body like whoa. SINGING Like whoa. SINGING That is not the only reason I liked her though. She said she moved with her mother to Florida from New York. SINGING Where dreams are made. SINGING Well so did I. So I said hi. She seemed mature and I talked more. SINGING More more! SINGING And I was like what the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING What the heck I gotta do? SINGING What the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING What the heck I gotta do? SINGING Tell me who I gotta be for you to be with me. You told her all this in class? SINGING Well yeah. I texted her! You know I was like SINGING what the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING L-O-L-O-L-O-L! SINGING What the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING R-O-F-L-O-L! SINGING Tell me who I gotta be for you to be with me. SINGING SINGING Smiley face. SINGING Yes! SINGING Next thing you know we are texting day and night. I trust her right away. SINGING Like whoa! SINGING Hey yo. I never met anyone like her bro. Yo she listens to all my problems. I let her copy all my homework. And then I lay it all on the line. And she was like-- SINGING No no-- SINGING No! She did not say no exactly. I do not know. SINGING No no no! SINGING Yeah I was surprised. I am a pretty great guy. SINGING So? So? SINGING So I decided I needed to step my game up. SINGING Oh. Oh. Oh! Oh. SINGING It is too late to be shy. So I got in front of the whole class one day and I serenaded her. I was like what the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING What the heck I gotta do? SINGING What the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING What the heck I gotta do? SINGING Tell me who I gotta be for you to go to prom with me! You asked her to the prom? SINGING Yeah! I danced and everything. SINGING SINGING Naomi! SINGING Naomi! I know there is a reason you were transferred here to me. SINGING Naomi! SINGING Naomi! I know there is a reason this is not luck. It is destiny. SINGING Naomi! SINGING Naomi! You know me! Will you go to prom with me? SINGING I will think about it. SINGING She will think about it. She will think about it. She will think about it. She will think about. SINGING She said she would think about it. SINGING She will think about it. SINGING She will think about it. SINGING Think about it. SINGING She will think about it. SINGING She will think about it. She will think about it. SINGING Yes!    SINGING I did not say yes. I did not say I will think about it. I cannot tell you my real name but yes I can confirm that I did get asked to the prom. The undercover officer who posed as Naomi is 25 years old a new recruit with the Palm Beach Police Force. SINGING My assignment-- to pose as a senior and find out who is buying who is selling. Mostly pills and weed. You would not believe how easy it is to get pills and weed. What is the hardest part? The cafeteria. Imagine hundreds of teenagers yelling and running full speed. And the lack of deodorant. Let us just say I would drink at the end of the day. Seriously these kids need to learn there are consequences in life. If I am doing my job and I am doing it right I am making life safer one school at a time. So he asked you to prom? SINGING Right. SINGING I gave every excuse. I said it is too expensive which is totally true by the way. I told him look I am just a transfer. I would not feel comfortable with all your friends. And it is true you make friends on the job. Then it ends. You meet kids who are sensitive smart and defenseless. Those are the ones you remember the ones that you think about after you are gone. Seriously these kids need to learn there are consequences in life. If I am doing my job and I am doing it right I am making life safer one school at a time. Meanwhile-- SINGING What the heck I gotta do to be with you? SINGING What the heck I gotta do? SINGING Tell me who I gotta be for you to be with me. SINGING Do you smoke? What? SINGING Do you smoke weed? SINGING No I do not. But if that is what you need I can find some for you. I can be your supply. SINGING You would do that for me? SINGING I can be your guy. Oh yes! SINGING Seriously these kids need to learn there are consequences in life. SINGING I will get whatever you need! SINGING If I am doing my job and I am doing it right I am making life safer one school at a time. Listen I am not a drug dealer. So it is not like she asked me this day and I got it for her the very next day. It took me a while you know? So I mean I am trying to get it and I cannot get it. What are you thinking as you are trying to get this pot to sell her? I am thinking what the heck am I doing? I never done this before. So I am you know-- I am really scared and skeptical at the same point. What did you end up doing?  I called a cousin who called a cousin who called his friend who called a couple dozen cousins 'ecause it does not end. My cousin Justin's looking for a little something-something for a certain someone some girl he wants to be touching. SINGING Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. We were just discussing our cousin Justin. Was not Justin the cousin who just made the honor roll got the colleges buzzin'? Are we close to our cousin Justin? Are we supposed to trust him? Are we thugs to our cousin Justin? We do not sell drugs man. SINGING Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Did you get it yet? No I am about to get it. Is your dealer a student? I got you girl. Do not sweat it. Let me know when you got it. As soon as I can. I will find a way to repay you Justin. Oh man! Yo what is up with this fussin'? This is not up for discussion. This is our cousin coming to us. He is our blood and we love him. Ah look at Justin. He is blushing. Our little Justin is crushing. Sorry for rushing to judgement. Why should we get you these drugs? SINGING Love! What? SINGING Only if you believe in love. Love! SINGING Love! Only if you believe in love. Get him the stuff. I hand my cousin 25 ducats. I am sweating buckets. He hands me a sandwich bag with some little green nuggets. I got it for you. X-O. Cool. You want it now? See you at school. SINGING Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. SINGING Love! SINGING Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin-- SINGING Only if you believe in love! SINGING --who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something. Everybody's got a cousin who can hook them up with something.   Now according to the police Justin is a drug dealer. Maybe Justin did not know where to get drugs. Maybe he did. What we know is this. The next day Justin brought a rolled-up baggie of marijuana to school for Naomi. And I was like oh my god I am actually about to do this. So we was in class and I sat down right next to her. And she was like-- Justin do you have it? Yeah I do. And I was like you know what? We are going to wait for a few. Because I did not want to be like oh hey and just slide it in her hand or whatever. So we waited.   And she was like-- OK put it in my purse. So I slid it right in there. And then she was like-- OK here. Take the money. Justin take the money. SINGING I do not want your money. I got this just for you. Keep your money. There is nothing I will not do for you. I will come through for you every time-- Justin time. SINGING Justin listen. Please just take the money. SINGING Naomi I know there is a reason you were transferred here. SINGING You are making me feel guilty. Take the money. SINGING Naomi I know there is a reason. This is not luck. It is destiny. SINGING You really did come through for me. SINGING Naomi you know me. SINGING There is only one last thing you need to do for me. SINGING I will be there just in time. Every time. SINGING Take the money. Take the money. SINGING Anytime. SINGING Take the money. SINGING Naomi. SINGING I do not want your money. SINGING The teacher's coming. Take this money Justin. SINGING I got this just for you. SINGING Naomi. SINGING Keep your money. SINGING We are not done. Please take this money Justin. SINGING Naomi. SINGING I will come through for you. SINGING Naomi. SINGING Take the money. SINGING Every time. Anytime. SINGING Take the money. Take this money Justin. SINGING Just in time. Justin would later find out it is a felony in Florida to sell marijuana. And the penalty is even harsher for selling it on school property. By taking the money Justin had made an irreversibly bad decision. And since he was over 18 he was legally an adult when he made it. SINGING Seriously these kids need to learn there are consequences in life. I am doing my job. I am doing it right. I am making life safe for one school at a time. In May the police arrested 31 students at several schools. Justin was one of them.  Freeze! You have the right to remain silent. SINGING Everybody who sold drugs to undercover cops is busted. Everybody who sold drugs to undercover cops is busted. Everybody who sold drugs to undercover cops is busted. Everybody who sold drugs to undercover cops is busted. He spends a week in jail wondering what would happen next. It is your word against hers. The cops have every text. The cops have every text. The cops have every text. SINGING Do not worry girl. I got the stuff. I got you. He knew he would lose in court. He had to take a plea. Three years' probation. I plead guilty to the felony. What? A felony? A nickel bag's a felony? What? SINGING Justin say goodbye to college. They got you. These kids need to wake up. I do not want to go too much into it but drugs hit really close to home for me. I saw the effects growing up of cocaine marijuana ecstasy. With family members? SINGING Yes. I have seen what it can do to a family. That is all I want to say about it. Do you wish someone like you had done this type of work? Yes. And I hope someone like me keeps doing it. Still SINGING there are kids you remember the ones that you think about after you are gone. During the week he spent in jail Justin could not help but think about Naomi. SINGING She was a light-skinneded Puerto Rican-Dominican long hair mature in the body like whoa. That is not the only reason I liked her though. Yo if it had been a guy that came up to me asking me for drugs I would have said no. I would have said get out of my face. I do not hang out with people like that. It is because it was her. Have you talked to her since all of this happened? Well no. I would love to. I would love to have that conversation. What do you think you would say? SINGING I would say what the heck did you do? What the heck did you do? Naomi? What the heck did you do?   Our cast Lindsay Mendez as Naomi Anthony Ramos as Justin.

To everybody who was actually listening to this right now on the radio-- or podcast I should say-- the staging of this story was like a 14-minute nonstop dance number from start to finish choreographed by Lorin Latarro costumes sets. Lots of laughs--   Lots of laughs in today's show are visual things that you are not seeing because you are hearing it only. If you would like to see what you are missing you can do that. You can do that right this second. You can download video of this entire show that we are doing today at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. Go to our website thisamericanlife.org. Like Beyonce we are dropping the album and all the videos on the same day.   She is a role model. We also have links to where you can get the official cast album recording of 21 Chump Street the Musical.   Possibly the shortest cast album recording in Broadway history. Coming up Mike Birbiglia and the secret jokes a professional comedian usually only shares at home. That is in a minute from Chicago Public Radio and Public Radio International when our program continues. It is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Each week on our program we choose a theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme. Today from the stage of the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Brooklyn New York City the radio drama episode.   We have journalism memoir true stories ed as radio drama. We have arrived at act two of our show. Act Two Of Mice and Men. So this next bit of radio drama is not an experiment for us like a musical or an opera. We thought it would be smart to have one story in today's show where we know what we are doing. A type of radio drama we actually bring you now and then on the program a true story told on stage by the person that it actually happened to. Please welcome comedian Mike Birbiglia.   Wow. It is pretty easy following a musical. I uh-- I think that my favorite thing about being married is actually that you can share jokes with your wife or husband that are funny to you and that person and no one else other than maybe your cat. Because when you have a cat your barometer for humor poof out the window. Last summer my wife and I went on a trip to Massachusetts. And I called it Cats-achusetts-- which is not funny but in our house was the joke of the year. I was like we are going to Cats-achusetts. My life is like ahh! I was like ahh! Our cat was like ahh! Everyone loves a good pun when you have a cat. And so we drive to Cats-achusetts. And when we arrive my wife has a headache. And she asks me if I will acclimate Ivan-- that is our cat-- to the bedroom because you cannot just put an indoor cat into a house because he will explode. And so I bring him in the bedroom. But I am so tired from the drive that I fall asleep which is the only thing you cannot do when acclimating an indoor cat to a house. And so I wake up an hour later. Ivan is gone. He got out. And so now I am running around the house. I am like my cat's going to explode. I wake up my wife. I was like Clo-- her name's Jen-- I say Mr. Fantastic is gone-- his name's Ivan. And Clo gave me a look that I can only describe as divorce eyes. Because before that point I was convinced that we would be married forever. And then once I saw the divorce eyes I was like oh I guess this could end. And if it ended it would look a lot like that. And so now the two of us are running around the house. I am like my marriage is falling apart. My cat's going to explode. And we find Ivan but we had another major problem in the house which is that there were mice in the house. It was actually worse than that because they were parasitic mice. They have what is called toxoplasmosis which means they have a-- yeah you might know what this is. They have a parasite in them and as a result they are unafraid of cats and they are unafraid of people. And the way we discovered this was that my wife was watching TV and she looked next to her. And there was a mouse. And he was watching TV also. And she screamed! And he just looked up at her like Stuart Little-- like hey what is going on? I do not like this show either. I do not know why all those women would want to marry that one guy. And then she pushed him off the couch. And he did not even run away. He did not even scurry which is a verb invented for mice. He just walked into the kitchen like a roommate-- like fine! I will go in the other room! I just think you are overreacting. And then he did a confessional into the Mouse Cam in the kitchen. He was like I am not here to make friends. I am here to win. I was here before they came. I will be here when they are gone. I am a mouse.   That is from Real Mouse-wives of Cats-achusetts. That night I am sound asleep and my wife wakes me up by grabbing my face. She says Mo-- my name's Mike-- Mr. Fantastic found the mouse. You need to get the mouse. And I sit up and I say Clo we have a cat. We do everything for the cat. We gave him food. We give him an apartment that he thinks is the world. We set aside an area in the apartment for him to poop in that we clean more often than the area where we poop. We have a gentleman's agreement that in the unlikely event that a mouse should walk in that door A LA MARLON BRANDO that he will kill that mouse and we will never speak of that mouse again. And he will be protected. NORMAL VOICE That is from Cat-father.   My wife says Mo get the mouse. And I sit up and I see what may be the strangest tableau I will ever witness in my entire life. Ivan's smacking the mouse. The mouse flies in the air lands gets up walks back towards Ivan. Ivan smacks the mouse flies in the air lands gets up walks back towards Ivan. Ivan is thrilled! His toy is alive! I have a serious sleepwalking disorder. So as I am watching this I am not even really sure it is happening. I am thinking I have had this dream before. My wife says Mo get the mouse. And she hands me a cup. I sit up. I walk towards the mouse. And the mouse walks towards me. I put the cup over the mouse. I put a magazine under the cup. I take the cup into the backyard and I put the mouse into the forest where I can only assume that he walked into the mouth of a wolf. And from that day forward we have called it Mouse-achusetts.   I want to point out something really special that happened there at the end. A few minutes ago I prefaced this story with a Massachusetts-based
