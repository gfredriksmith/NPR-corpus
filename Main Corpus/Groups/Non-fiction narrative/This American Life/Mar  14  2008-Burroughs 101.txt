There is this moment during the Cuban Missile Crisis that is so incredible it does not sound real. But we have confirmed this with people who were there. Victor Gilinsky wrote about this for the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. He said basically nuclear war seemed so imminent that the underground headquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska went into lock down. Nobody was allowed to enter or leave. He said the General in charge told the staff he expected an order to launch nuclear missiles any moment and also expected that they would all die from a Soviet counterattack. And everybody was allowed to make one phone call home to their family. But in that call they were not allowed to say why they were calling. What do you say in that situation? Gilinsky writes The conversations were about scraped kids' knees and sick dogs. It was a scene straight out of Dr. Strangelove. And of course right? What can words do when you are staring death in the face? Well today on our program we have two stories where ordinary people rise to this exact task. They see death standing there and they open their mouths. And truly amazing things happen. We have two stories for you today. And to say anything else about these stories I think would be a spoiler. Also I want to give every possible second to these stories. From WBEZ Chicago it is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. And let us just get to it with the first act of our show. So remember that tsunami that hit Japan five years ago March 2011? Giant black waves more than 30-feet tall hit Japan.  A guy in a little town called Otsuchi shot this video. You can hear him yelling.  All the houses are washing away.   Otsuchi had been there for 100 years. In 30 minutes it was gone-- almost totally flattened. The tsunami and the earthquake that went with it killed six times more people than died in 911-- over 19000 people. Another 2500 are still missing. And in the aftermath of course families struggled to figure out how they were going to move forward without the people they loved. And in that town of Otsuchi it lead to this new-- I do not know ritual is not exactly the right word for this. But it is something close to that-- this thing that people invented to stay connected to the dead. One of our producers Miki Meek has family in Japan. And she grew up going back and forth between there and here. And she watched this documentary about this thing people are doing Otsuchi on the Japanese news channel NHK and got permission for us to play you some excerpts. Here's Miki. Of all the areas in Japan affected by that tsunami Otsuchi has one of the highest numbers of missing people-- 421. Today it is still partly in ruins and partly a construction site as they try to rebuild the town on higher ground. But a year before that tsunami happened this guy named Itaru Sasaki-- he was already dealing with a loss. His cousin had just died. And Itaru was having a hard time figuring out how to talk about it. So he did something pretty ingenious. He went out and bought an old-fashioned phone booth and stuck it in his garden. It looks like an old English-style one. It is square and painted white and has these glass window panes. Inside is a black rotary phone resting on a wood shelf. This phone connected to nowhere. It did not work at all. But that did not matter to Itaru. He just needed a place where he felt like he could talk to his cousin a place where he could air out his grief. And so putting an old phone booth in his garden which sits on this little windy hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean it felt like a perfect solution.   He is saying because my thoughts could not be relayed over a regular phone line I wanted them to be carried on the wind.  So I named it the wind telephone-- kaze no denwa. The idea of keeping up a relationship with the dead is not such a strange one in Japan. The line between our world and their world is thin. Lots of families keep a Buddhist altar for their dead relatives in the living room. My uncle has one for our family. There are photos on a little platform. And every day he leaves fresh fruit and rice for them lights incense and rings a bell. It is a way to stay in touch to let them know that they are still a big part of our family. So after the tsunami and earthquake happened word got out about Itaru's special wind telephone-- that he was using it as another way to stay connected to the dead. Soon people started showing up randomly on his property and walking right into the phone booth. This has been going on for five years now. Itaru estimates that thousands of people from all over Japan have come to use his phone. A TV station asked Itaru and the people who come to use his phone if they could videotape their calls from a distance and put an audio recorder in the phone booth. They wanted to get a sense of how people are still grieving. I watched their documentary after the fifth anniversary of the tsunami back in March. That whole week all of the news programs in Japan were airing memorial programs. But I found the calls in this particular program remarkable and moving for just how simple they were. One woman from Otsuchi named Sachiko Okawa showed up one afternoon. She is 71-years-old and lost her husband in the tsunami. She regularly brings her two young grandsons to the phone booth. And you can tell by how casually they talk to him on the phone. They squish into the phone booth with their grandma wearing matching blue-and-black-striped shirts. Sachiko starts the call by picking up the receiver and saying hello. Moshi moshi. Moshi moshi. Her oldest grandson quickly jumps in.  Hi grandpa.  How are you?  I will be in fourth grade next semester. Was not that fast?  Daina my younger brother he will be in second grade next year. Then Sachiko corrects him. She says no Daina will be in second grade this year not next.  Yeah this year. A lot of calls were just like this straightforward updates about life. The kind of a quick highlights reel you might give to any family member you were catching up with on the phone. The boy he then tells his grandpa--  Grandma's fine too.  I am giving the phone to Daina now.  Daina his little brother grabs the phone.  Grandpa I finished all my homework. Sachiko urges him to keep talking.   He says everyone is doing fine. Then he hangs up. They all say goodbye. Bye Bye.    As they are walking out of the booth Daina says--  Maybe Grandpa will say he heard us.   In another call a woman in a puffy winter jacket with a fur-lined hood shows up at the booth by herself. Her name is Kikue Hirano and she is 66. She used to live in Otsuchi. But she moved away after she lost her house and her husband in the tsunami. Her husband was a deep-sea fisherman. His name was Miyoji and they used to talk and drink sake together at night. Now Kikue lives alone about 50 miles away. But sometimes Kikue finds herself driving back to Otsuchi into this booth. I watched her do this thing that a lot of callers seem to do. You hear Kikue actually dialing the rotary phone-- OK. --saying some numbers to herself.  4 2 5 7 4 4. She is dialing the phone number for her old house in Otsuchi the last place she knew to reach her husband. Then Kikue just stands in the booth in silence holding the phone to her ear. Sometimes she fidgets around and tilts her head up and concentrates on the ceiling the same way I do when I want to cry but I am trying hard not to. It does not work. Kikue brushes some tears off her face. Eventually she hangs up. She lingers in the booth a little longer hands clasped together in front of her staring at the phone booth floor. She walks out. One pattern that the owner of the phone booth Itaru has noticed over the years is that more men than women come to use it. Not surprisingly this is not a demographic that is known for sharing their feelings especially the older farmers. They already have a reputation for not talking much. In one of the phone calls recorded in winter a man with gray hair and a little towel hanging around his neck walks into the garden. This kind of towel is part of the uniform of Japanese farmers. They use them to wipe away sweat and clean their hands. This man opens the telephone booth door. And under his breath you hear him say huh so this is the wind telephone? This appears to be his very first visit to the phone booth. He lost his oldest son in the tsunami. His son's name was Nobuyuki. He also lost his house and had to move into temporary housing with his wife. And recently she got sick and also passed away. He calls her okaasan. It means mom in Japanese. It is what everyone in the family calls the female head of the house even the husband. It is a very intimate loving term.   Moshi moshi? Hello?  Nobuyuki?  Is mom with you?  Sorry to ask this but take care of her and your grandma and grandpa too.  Mom?  I will come again OK?  Mom I will be back.  Bye.    He uses the towel around his neck to wipe his eyes.   One of the things that makes these calls so poignant to me is all the understated ways that people are actually saying I love you and I miss you. I would never say something so direct like that in Japanese. It is just not done. I have only seen people say it in the soap operas. . Even saying that right now it feels weird. I have never said that to my mom or my grandparents.   Take this call. It is winter. The phone booth is surrounded by snow. Moshi moshi? Hello?  Mom?  Where are you? He is an older man wearing a baseball cap. He also calls his wife mom. His wife daughter and mother they all went missing in the tsunami.  It is so cold. But you are not getting cold are you?  Are grandma and our daughter Miyuki with you too?  Come back soon.  Be found soon. Everyone is waiting for you.  OK?  I will build the house in the same place.  Eat something-- anything.  Just be alive somewhere anywhere.  I am so lonely.     He never says I love you directly. Real feelings are communicated through small gestures especially ones of concern. Like when he asked his wife are you staying warm? Are you eating? And then promising I will build a house for us. These are total heartfelt declarations of love.   For other men the phone booth is a place where they can finally say their complicated feelings out loud. They can voice their regrets. Anyone who is had someone close to them die knows this feeling. Like I have kept having the same one-way conversation with my dad in my head ever since he passed away last year. I just keep telling him all the situations where I wish I had been kinder more patient. One call I watched was from a young father with rectangle glasses and a long black jacket. He lost his family-- both parents his wife-- her name was Mine-- and one-year-old son named Issei.    Dad?  Mom?  Mine? Issei? Issei?   It is already been five years since the disaster.  If this voice reaches you please listen. CRYING  Sometimes I do not know what I am living for. CRYING Issei  Issei please let me hear you call me Papa. CRYING Papa  Even though I built a new house--  Dad? Mom?  Mine and Issei.  --without all of you it is meaningless.  I want to hear your reply but I cannot hear anything.    He hangs up the phone takes off his glasses and covers his eyes with his hands. WHISPERING  I am sorry. WHISPERING  I am so sorry I could not save you.        There is a couple phrases I heard callers tell the dead again and again. Shinpai shina do not worry about us. And ganbatteiru which basically means I am doing my very best. I am enduring. In Japan ganbatteiru-- it is a catchall slogan for slogging through life's many challenges no matter how tiny or big. From trying to pass a test at school to grieving you hear it all the time for everything. In the phone booth ganbatteiru and shinpai shina-- these are key phrases to reassure the dead that the living the people left behind they are doing OK even if they are not. People do not want to worry or burden their loved ones even dead loved ones. Because most Japanese are Buddhist and generally believe that when someone dies they are not suddenly relieved of all their earthly concerns. They are not automatically in heaven happy and carefree. Many people believe that if the dead see a family member suffering they cannot let go of their earthly life. They hesitate to cross to the other side and end up stuck in a no-man's land. I heard these reassurances in a call from a 15-year-old kid named Ren Kozaki to his dad. He arrived at the phone booth after spending four hours on public transportation by himself. Ren lives in a city much farther north that was not affected as much by the tsunami. But his dad was a truck driver who drove all over Japan. And in a last-minute schedule change he got sent on a route that took him along the coast when the tsunami hit. He is been missing ever since. Ren went into the phone booth wearing a red backpack.  And what he does in his call-- you hear him signaling to his dad that it is OK. He should keep moving on into the after world.  Dad?  The four of us are doing fine.  We are ganbatteiru.  You do not need to worry about us. Shinpai shina.  Dad are you doing OK?  I do have one question I want to ask you.  Why did you die? Why did it have to be you dad?  Why just me?  I have always wondered--  Why am I the only one who is different from everyone else?  Anyways please be found quickly.  Where are you now?  They never found anything of you.  I wanted to talk with you again.     Ren left the booth. In late February he came back with his entire family-- his mom younger brother and sister. They all drove down to Otsuchi together. And when they got to the phone booth at first they kind of awkwardly hung out in front of it. So to break the ice Ren walks in and places the first call to their dad. He tells him--  I brought everyone with me today.  Bye. When Ren walks out his family laughs. They say--   --that was so fast. Ren shoots back--  It was just a quick report to Dad that I brought everyone with me today. Next up are Ren's little brother and sister who are 12 and 14 years old.  They go into the booth together. And the sister is talking and laughing nervously.  What am I supposed to say? What should I tell them?   Wait wait do not leave me alone in here.   The sister picks up the phone. And let me just say the mom told the film crew that this is a girl who has not said a single word about her dad to anyone since he went missing five years ago. So she picks up the phone and starts to cry.   She asks her brother again when should I talk to him about? Her little brother's name is Riku and he tells her--  Say what you wanted to tell him.  She says--  Are you trying to make me laugh Riku? Riku says--  No I am not. Then she finally starts talking to her dad. The conversation is all over the place and she is crying so hard she can barely talk.  Dad I am so sorry I always used to say you were stinky.    What happen to your promise to buy me a violin?  Now I will have to buy one myself. Her little brother who sticks close to her he encourages her to keep going. He says--  What else? So she tells her dad--  I started tennis in junior high school. I am not in the top eight.   I want to be in the top eight our last tournament.  Please cheer for me.  I got hooked on this boy band the Johnnys when I was in my first year of junior high. I am still hooked. They both say--   --goodbye. They come out of the booth together. Now it is their mom's turn. Her kids tell her itterashai. Itterashai. Have a good trip. Itterashai. Good luck. Ren the oldest he bows and waves to her. She walks in picks up the phone and lets out a big sigh.    Where should I start?   I feel like you are still alive-- somewhere.  We had so many things we wanted to do together.  Over the phone we always said to each other are you alive? Yes I am alive.  It was our password between the two of us was not it? CRYING  I cannot ask you that anymore.    Come back.  We all four of us together we will be waiting.  Bye.     After she comes out the family lingers outside the phone booth for a while.  This was literally the first time they would all talked about their dad together since the tsunami happened five years ago. The youngest Riku-- he sat quietly on a bench with his head in his hands. The night before his dad disappeared they went to a public bath together. His mom and older siblings tell him--  Riku you do not need to keep your feelings in. Go ahead and cry when you want to. Ren the oldest gently teases him. He says--  See? He cannot stop crying. Mom says yeah but--  --he held back until now.  It is OK because you held back. You endured until now. The sister then hands Riku her handkerchief. The mom says her kids we were all about to fall apart. We were so broken. We did not think we could make it through. And maybe that is why we never talked about dad until now. But talking to him on the phone today it changed something.   Miki Meek is one of the producers of our program. Thanks to NHK Sendai who recorded all this and shared it with us. Coming up two brothers in their 80s have a last chance to talk to each other before they die. And neither wants to take it. That is in a minute from Chicago Public Radio when our program continues. It is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Today's program-- One Last Thing Before I Go stories that are about-- well they are about what power do words have in the face of death? We have arrived at Act Two of our program.  Act Two Uncle's Keeper. So in the first act of our program people kind of defied death by making small talk-- and some talk that was not so small-- with their dead relatives. In this act somebody wants to do something very similar-- make a connection that seemed impossible between people. Except in this story all the relatives are alive which you would think would make it super easy. This story comes from Jonathan Goldstein. Hello? Hey Dad? Hi Jonny. Hey how you doing? Good you? Good good. Gut Yontif. Shana tova. Chag Sameach. Chag Sameach.  What is that mean? I am not sure. Oh oh. This is my father Buzz. I am calling him at his home in Montreal. And the reason we are talking crazy talk is because it is Yom Kippur the Jewish Day of Atonement which seems as good a day as any to talk with him about forgiveness. So I wanted to-- Yes. I wanted to ask you something. And I just wanted to gauge your interest. Yeah. How-- how would you feel about paying your brother Sheldon a visit? I have no feelings about it. I am not really interested. You are not? No. My father Buzz is 80. And his brother Sheldon his only sibling is 85. And for the past 40 years they have pretty much been on the outs.  My father lives in Montreal and Sheldon lives in Florida. And the last time they saw each other over 20 years ago was at their mother's funeral where they had a fight over the details of the arrangements. Since then they have hardly spoken. It worries me because there is not a lot of time left. And I do not want my father to have regrets. And my father has a profound capacity for regret. My mother gave up trying to reunite them years ago after many attempts. So I know that if I do not push him no one else will. I am not surprised that you are not jumping at the idea. But I am a little surprised-- No. -- that you are as against the idea. Yeah time's passed. He has not shown much interest. So I am respecting that and I leave him alone. What he did do was he called you on your 80th birthday not so long ago. Yeah. Yeah. And you felt good about that. Yeah because I called him on his 80th birthday. This kind of tit-for-tat accounting is what always gets in the way. You know what it is at this point with him? I will tell you what it is. I do not think it is even anger. He is past anger and he is past any feelings of animosity. He is past that. He just does not care. Yeah. You know that is apathy. I mean sometimes-- at least hate or love they are emotions. Apathy is nothing. Yeah. But you know what? Jonny as a child even when I was 10 when I was 9 and 8 I was crazy about him. We had a great-- you know I loved him. He was the older brother. He was-- hello? Yeah yeah yeah I am listening. You know I just looked up to him. And he had all the friends. Sometimes he would take me along with him. And he was . . Somebody tried-- is somebody to call here binging me here? The most complicated question the one I keep coming back to is how did the bad blood begin? And there are many versions. An ill-fated trip to Montreal where Sheldon felt slighted about having to stay in my father's basement. An ill-fated trip to New York where my father felt slighted about having to stay in Sheldon's attic. Rude words spoken to each other's wives. In one version of the story Sheldon's refusal to bring a table to my bris almost resulted in my being circumcised on an ironing board. But in the version being told today my father was asked by Sheldon to pay more than his fair share for their mother's funeral. And I said you are always working some kind of an angle. So he got furious. He got furious. He started screaming into the phone go to hell. Drop dead bah bah bah. He was-- that was how that ended. But I feel he is the kind of guy that he has angles like that you know? He has angles. I always felt I was on the up-and-up with him and he was not with me. If you got a stronger sense that he was interested in seeing you then would you-- Yes. Yes. You would be more inclined to see him? I would not stay at his house though that is out of the question. OK quick sidebar. Anytime I have ever raised the prospect of visiting Sheldon no matter how hypothetical the scenario my father always makes a point of insisting how no matter what he would not stay in Sheldon's house-- even if he was invited to. Which I should point out he never is. I would not stay at his house. How come you--  I would not stay there. I mean it is not my thing. How come you always bring that up? Because I do not feel comfortable. Normally when someone goes to visit someone that they have not seen in decades they will stay at a hotel you know?  I would stay at a motel or somewhere near his place.  A motel. Yeah no we would get a place with an ice machine and-- you know. Why you are interested in making a trip? I am interested--  Do you think that there is anything to be gained in seeing him? Hmm I guess there is something. You share your common experience and you talk about the old days. There are things that only he and I can remember. You know? Yeah. What you could do is you could call him. Yeah. And see what his attitude is. You know? It depends on how you feel what kind of reception you get. Yeah I mean I would be happy to do that. My concern is that-- I like your initial suggestion that you call and feel him out. See what he is like. OK I did not suggest that but-- you--  you suggested that. Yeah I like that. Because you will give me an honest reaction. I am happy to do it. But I mean what are you looking for? What do you want to hear from him? I miss my brother I would like to see him. OK. That is all. OK. You understand? And you come back on me with an honest evaluation.    Hello? Sheldon? Yes speaking. Hi. That was quite a shock getting your phone call. You said Jon and my hearing is not that great. OK. And when I heard the first message I am saying who the heck is that? I do not know anybody by that name. Sheldon now lives outside of Fort Lauderdale. But my few memories of him are from when he lived in upstate New York. I remember he lived in a trailer. I remember that he worked at a local prison that he smoked cigars that he looked a little like my father but was hunched like the world was weighing down on him. And he always wore this expression on his face that seemed to say you got to be kidding me. You are keeping OK? You are keeping occupied? Yeah I read a lot. I go to the gym. I go shopping. You know here and there little things here and there.  So how often do you go to the gym? Three times a week. My father also goes to the gym. That is a part of his routine also. He was happy to hear from you on his 80th birthday. Yeah well he did not call me on my 85th though. Tit meet tat.   To be honest with you in the last few years I have been a loner. Uh huh. You would basically almost call me a recluse. I do not socialize with many people. And I really do not give a damn what anybody thinks. Yeah. And contrary to popular belief I like being alone by myself. I get along with myself very well. Yeah. Look I do not want to be rude or anything but I want to go have my lunch. Oh yeah yeah that is fine. Yeah. It is fine. Sheldon I appreciate your talking to me. And you would be amenable to spending some time? Why not? We are brothers. I mean we are not close or anything. But you know we are not going to have a chance to see each other much in the future.  Yeah. Is that anything that you think about? Not much no.  Press where to then type. Do you have an address? Yeah I do. My dad and I meet up at the Fort Lauderdale airport. I flew from New York and my dad from Montreal. My father's all dressed up wearing a faux suede sports jacket that I have never seen him in. We grab our airport rental and prepare for the two-hour drive to Sheldon. In the 90-degree heat it is immediately made clear that faux suede might not have been the best fashion choice. It is like we are on a safari here. On the road to Sheldon's my father will experience a spectrum of feelings. As we first set out there is excitement. My brother was funny in a lot of ways. I could laugh. We are going to have laughs with him. He is a very funny man. A half an hour in and there is bitterness. We invited him to your bar mitzvah. And he returned a very cold card. Sorry we will not be attending. It was so mean. You know what I mean? Even the writing. An hour in and how was Buzz feeling? I am relaxed. Oh good. Kind of old to get anxious you know what I mean? Yeah. A half an hour to Sheldon's. A little bit apprehensive now.  Yeah. 10 minutes to Sheldon's and Buzz is feeling-- I am all right. Yeah?  Yeah. Yeah? You feeling a little-- Oh it is going to be strange. Yeah. It is going to be very strange. I mean the man is a stranger to me now. And yet he is my brother. You understand? It is a very strange feeling. Yeah. I wonder if he is getting nervous? Maybe. Cause he is waiting for us right? Yeah. Sheldon lives in the corner house on a quiet suburban street. Ring the bell. I guess. Is this his door? I will double check. Oh here he is. Hi! Hello. Hey! There is an  It is good to see you. And this is Jonathan? Good to see-- Nice to meet you. Come in. Thank you. Lately I have become a monk-- me and my pussycat. Oh you got a cat. Oh come here. What?  After all the years and the worry and the dread things seem to be going swimmingly. We sit down at Sheldon's kitchen table and my father gets right into it. Now there is things I want to know. You said that Rainy died? Yeah she died. She did die. The dead are a good place to begin. As a subject they are easily agreed upon and not likely to spark a fight. Yankel died. Yankel died? He was the youngest brother. Oh he died long ago. He died eh? Oh you know who died? Who? Hoffman. Hoffman? A real prick.  Yeah I did not know him that well. What a prick. Yeah yeah. Kanish.   Oh that is shocking. Yeah he was fat. He was fat. Redhead. Redhead right. Yeah. Kanish. Yeah remember Johnny? Johnny was a sex maniac. Johnny-- oh he would  a dog on the street. If he saw the dog he would try to  the dog.  Can I get you guys a cold beer? I would like a beer. Yeah sure. How about you? I will have a beer. Thank you. Even though they are in their 80s Sheldon and Buzz still possess voices and temperaments suited to shouting out Brooklyn tenement windows. While my voice-- VOICE CRACKS Yeah sure I will have a beer-- Is best suited to asking a waitress if there will be a sharing charge. I defined-- Oh whoa.   forgot about that. Sorry. Case in point-- this is Sheldon accidentally swiping a portable microphone receiver off the kitchen table and me trying to smooth things over. Take this off will you? It is annoying. Here just put it in your pocket there. Just take it off would you please? Thank you. Thank you. All right. Over the next two days my testes will flee like frightened cockroaches upward ascending to heights not seen since the bar mitzvah that Sheldon was not attending. While it is fun watching them reminisce I would say that about 80 of my uncle Sheldon's stories about the good old days are filthy enough to make them virtually unbroadcastable. But here's one-- specially selected and beeped for your delicate ears. Wally Rosen. Wonder whatever became of him. He was a bum. Me and Wally Rosen were joining the weightlifting club. So you had to be tested for a rupture. I remember he put his hand . I started laughing so hard I  right in his .  Ay yay yay. Over the years I have seen my father in the role of husband uncle and grandfather. But I have never really seen him in the role of younger brother. How odd to see it now at 80. He sits beside Sheldon with this expression I have never seen on his face. It is wide-eyed sweet and deferential. But as the day wears on Sheldon and Buzz begin to squabble over their memories fighting over every little detail. Remember the hullabaloo we had with hair dyer that heavy-set girl? She was a manicurist. She was a hair dyer. Manicurist. No she was a hair dyer. Here's what happened. She went over to Irving's-- They even argue over the death of their grandmother. I found her body. I did. I opened the door. No. I did. No my mother was across the street at . I remember walking in-- I walked in on her. And I knew she was dead soon as I saw her. I never saw a dead body in my life but I knew she was dead. Sure. So wait so you found her or you found her? I remember looking in on her room to see how she was doing. She was awfully quiet.  . I found her but let him take the credit. No I am not.  Some credit. The whole afternoon is like this. Every subject even their dead grandmother somehow becomes fodder for another pissing match. They are burning up all this time with small talk when what they need is some big talk. In particular they need to address a story that I know holds a great deal of meaning for my father. It took place in 1939 on the day their mother left them. I have only ever heard the story from my father never from Sheldon. I wanted to ask what you remember. What your perspective-- Well I remember that time was when Pop was smacking her around and she ran out in the hall. And her slip-- Fighting in the hall. And he was smacking her around. Yeah smacking her around. She ran out. So what happened the next morning? The next morning? Yeah. Looked in her closet. Her clothes were gone. She left. Ah. What happened after this in my father's telling is that his mother returned soon after she left with a policeman in tow. And they came back to try to get you. They wanted you to come back with them. And where were you? I was there but they were trying to drag you out of the house.  They were not trying to grab you out? No no no. I guess they want my father and grandmother. This is the point of the story for my father. It proves once and for all how his mother loved Sheldon more than she loved him. Sheldon did not move out with her. And after a year their mother returned. And together Buzz and Sheldon grew up under the same roof in the same bedroom often sleeping under the same blankets each knowing who the mother had chosen and each having to do their best to carry on and live life with the burden of that knowledge.  A couple times during the day I ask them why they have not spoken in so long. And they both insist maybe out of embarrassment that they do talk just not often. But it is not true. In fact my father learned of Sheldon's wife's death many years after the fact-- and then only from me. Sheldon's daughter got in touch through Facebook and we made a phone date where she caught me up on her life and Sheldon's. And a few nights later while over at my parents' for dinner I told my father of his sister-in-law's death. There was a terrible look that fell across his face. One of sadness but something else too maybe shock over just how far he and Sheldon had drifted. I found out about Judy-- about her death. Who? Your wife. I did not know about it either until you told me. Yeah. Did not I tell you? No. You did not know about it? No? We did not know. Hmm? We did not know. She was sick about two years there Judy.  Too bad. Well when she got the diagnosis she was already stage IV. What did I know about cancer? I did not. The surgeon-- so I says well doctor how did the surgery go? Oh he said it went very well. Bu
