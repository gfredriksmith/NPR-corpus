There is a scene in the film I Am Legend where OK civilization is over. The only person left alive in New York is Will Smith and he is not able to find traces of anyone else alive anywhere on Earth. And every morning he wakes up and makes himself breakfast and puts on videos of The Today Show from back before the Earth was destroyed just to make the morning seem normal. One of the sports fans on our staff Matt was saying the other day that that is exactly what it is like today watching the constant replays of old sports on television. He is watched the 2018 Stanley Cup the NBA Finals Game 7 from 2013 an old Yankees game from 1978 the Masters last year that Tiger Woods won all that glory from back when life was normal and sports was part of it. Part of the thrill of the Michael Jordan documentary The Last Dance was it was not just sports but a primetime Sunday night sports event that you could look forward to and you could watch knowing other fans were watching and talk about and share memes just like the world used to be. These two guys who write about college football Jason Kirk and Spencer Hall wrote this thing that I love about the lack of sports in our world today. These are guys who normally spend over 50 hours a week on a slow week watching games and thinking about sports who these days like hungry men raiding an empty kitchen pantry for any scrap of food have resorted to watching old college games that they have seen before and live Korean baseball in the middle of the night and the German soccer league Bundesliga. Saturday morning the choice was between Bundesliga and cornhole the American tailgate game where people throw sandbags at a wooden plank. That is Jason. Here's Spencer explaining what he is come to. I yesterday put on for the edification of my kids and their larger education Ricky Steamboat versus Macho Man Randy Savage at WrestleMania 3. And it is largely considered the greatest wrestling match of all time. And I realized that since I am homeschooling my kids they had to see the important classics of my culture. The canon. The canon yeah. No I mean it really-- we are joking but we are not. Like canonically there is a lot of controversy about what is in the canon wrestling-wise. No one disputes this. Spencer's watching way fewer games under lockdown and sometimes he says he thought this actually might be better for him in some way to devote fewer hours to sports maybe. Maybe. But it also makes me realize that the things I fill them with are not much better. There is a lot of empty--  There is a lot of empty space out there man. There is a lot of empty space in life. And when somebody says well now you can fill it with something really meaningful will you? Or is that even an option? I think there is only so much meaning you can pack into the hours of a week. I think there is only so much productivity within one person. I think that is something by the way this has forced me to confront. Anyway the essay these guys wrote about sports during these sportsless months is called What Were Sports? And the tone of it is like people who live in tents surrounded by rubble after a war remembering what it was like to live in houses looking back on their old lives which only now they appreciate for what they were. The essay starts this way. I remember there were expensive commercials. I definitely remember expensive commercials being a part of live sports. I only noticed this when sports on replay happened. The ads for replay games are cheap and very sad-- home generators car warranties bootleg tactical gear for things that should not be tactical like car visors and hearing aids. Do you remember how back when there were sports each person had a list of teams they strongly preferred to win? Like if the Portland Trail Blazers and Memphis Grizzlies squared off you and I would be a little bit happier about life if the Grizzlies were the team that won. What was that all about? Other things they miss-- Phillies fans doing things that were not normal for anybody but Phillies fans spreadsheets of sports statistics for each game whose results then went into a spreadsheet for the whole season which then went into a historical archives spreadsheet. Watching a four-hour game and walking away with one GIF-worthy moment they write felt like a version of sifting for gold but a version in which the dirt itself was valuable. One cool thing I remember about sports is watching people run fast in one direction. It was fun to watch someone do this when unimpeded such as when Usain Bolt walked into a mall in church shoes or whatever and ran as fast as the fastest NFL player ever had. But it was 10 times as fun when someone was able to run really far while other people were trying to stop that person from running far. Also fun watching big people try to stop fast people from running. They write Sports were little chemistry labs designed to run for hours months and centuries along the way producing countless things nobody could have predicted from the onset-- a cool otherworldly space place where people could completely depressurize for several hours and sometimes succumb to space madness along the way when things went haywire. Do you remember that part? That part was like Apollo 13. Like when your team's starting safety went out with an injury and they had to figure out how to play with 10 defenders and one guy who should have been going to law school instead of covering the other team's best receiver. That part was a problem but a fun one to solve. These problems very much belong to someone else despite us getting to invest feelings in whether they solved these problems or not. Caring about whether a mediocre general manager could finally figure out how to do sports budgets this was kind of like politics but in a fake world in which we did not have to acknowledge politics can kill us. That was nice. There is a whole passage in the essay where Spencer reminisces about the last live game he went to LSU and Clemson in New Orleans and got oysters before the game and met a friend at a restaurant the next day to eat and talk football for hours. He writes Do you hear all the beats of an impossible world playing there? I do. I feel every little ping of a world that I have only missed for 45 days at this point like cactus needles just pressing into the skin of a hovering hand. Jason sums it all up neatly with this. For me the thing that mattered most about sports is how they by design did not matter. We built industrial complexes around them but at heart they were about discovering which side had earned the right to shout the cooler obscenities on any given day. And then the following day we would rediscover. Well today on our program for everybody who is yearning for sports right now in our sportsless world we try to help with radio methadone for your sports addiction. Is that metaphor too negative? We have sports stories from back before the lockdown back when professional sports were still a vital daily living force. We relive the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat. From WBEZ Chicago it is This American Life. I am Ira Glass. Stay with us. Act One Friday Night Floodlights. OK so let us begin with this story of people yearning for sports to begin again in a moment a few years back when nothing was normal at all. Businesses were shut down. School was canceled. Kids were stuck home. This story happened right after Hurricane Katrina in two towns in Mississippi that sit right on the Gulf of Mexico Waveland and Bay St. Louis. Waveland was pretty much wiped out in the hurricane. Most homes and businesses there were destroyed or severely damaged. Bay St. Louis only did a little better. A month after the hurricane when we broadcast our story about them most people still did not have electricity. You could not drink water from the faucet. One of the first things they decided to bring back even before that other stuff-- football high school football. One of our producers back then Lisa Pollak went down there in 2005 during those early weeks after Katrina and put together this story. The Bay High Tigers played their first game of the season on the Friday before Katrina. They beat Hancock High 30-14. After the storm the joke was that they would gone undefeated. Everyone figured the season was over. Players were homeless. The high school was closed. But just days after the hurricane the Bay High coach Brenan Compretta started hearing from his players. They wanted to play football. They called his cell and sent text messages. They stopped him on the street. They wanted to play football. They wanted something that reminded them of what life was before. The thing that a lot of them were saying is it only takes 11 to play and that no matter how many they had they wanted to do this. That was the only thing that they had to look forward to. You would not stage a school play without a school but football's different-- here anyway. In Bay St. Louis game day starts at 630 AM with a team breakfast at a church. Newspaper stories about the game are posted on the wall at school. In the afternoon drummers from the band march through the hallways just before the pep rally. Strangers in town stop players to talk about that week's game. So even though school will not start again until November the coach called a meeting to try to restart the team. There were some challenges. Only 19 players showed up of the 70 who are on the team. They could not use their practice field since National Guardsmen were camping there. Their field house was destroyed and most of their equipment. And as for their uniforms-- We pulled up a few days after the storm. They had people running around in our jerseys and cleats and throwing balls around. And I guess it was fathers and sons or whatever. Wait you saw people wearing your guys' football jerseys just as like replacement clothes? Right exactly. And considering the circumstances I did not get really upset about it. I just was like well I guess if they need some clothes they can go ahead and take them. They are saying that there is a possibility-- they are saying it is probably going to be one of the most packed games we have played ever. It is game day the Tigers' very first game since Hurricane Katrina one month after the storm. And I had flown to Mississippi where Tyler Brush the team's quarterback is showing me around. There is not a lot to see just huge piles of wreckage and near the beach mile after mile of empty spaces where houses and buildings used to be. After the hurricane Tyler's family left for a while moved to Florida to a town where they used to live. They got a nice house and Tyler began high school there. He was practicing with their football squad and he was going to be a starter there too. But then Coach Compretta called. Tyler says coming back here was a hard choice. My dad he originally did not want me to come back. I mean he was pretty much against it but he decided-- I mean he said that it was my decision. I mean I had to think about it a lot. I was nervous about coming back. I mean I recognized the situation. I knew I was taking a chance if I came back here. College teams might not see me playing. But I felt that I still needed to come back though for whoever did come back. As quarterback he did not want to let the team down. So now his family's living 15 miles away in Diamond Head and two of the team's other players whose families did not return are living with them too. This is a strange place to be a kid right now. With no school they spend their days doing cleanup work hauling out sheet rock and moving trees and debris. It is bleak and boring. Their favorite hangouts are gone. Football is one of the few things they have left. We are actually pulling up to my house now. Yeah this is-- pretty much nothing left of my house. There is stairs right here-- were right here leading up to the house. They are completely gone. Literally all we are looking at are the wooden stilts that held up the house and the foundation which looks like it was lifted up from the ground. Yeah. And I mean there is not even stuff around like furniture or clothes. Where did all the stuff go? I guess the water just washed them up that way-- wiped out. There is nothing left. Does anybody in here need pants? You need pants come with me. Over at the football field the new uniforms arrive just in time a gift from a man in North Carolina. And the kids line up while the coaches open the boxes. 2 3 4 5. The new jerseys are blue and white not blue and gold the school colors but no one seems to care. Hold on. Hey man. We are not getting picky here. Just relax buddy. What do you need? This is not the team it used to be. Over half the Tigers still have not come back so the coaches have filled out the roster with some new recruits-- a few seniors who have never played football some freshmen from the school's ninth grade team two guys from the Tigers' archrival St. Stanislaus-- they canceled their season-- and to cap it all off Bad News Bears style some scared looking seventh and eighth graders from the junior high. In all it is still just 29 players a long way from 70. Some of these kids are all but homeless sleeping on other families' couches and floors. One linebacker is living in a camper alone his parents hours away all so he can play football. With everything these kids have been dealing with and everything they have seen they seem genuinely relieved and excited to be here today putting on jerseys and lacing up cleats. Everybody's just anxious to play again to get things back to normal. That is Trevor Adam a senior tight end. And for him getting things back to normal means pretty much one thing. I love hitting people. I mean there is no better feeling in the world just unloading on somebody. I mean even now dealing with all this you have an extra feel of warmth. You get just that exciting feeling about hitting somebody. There is no-- you cannot explain it. Equally excited is Brandt a tenth grader. I think Brandt might be one of the happiest kids I have ever met. He does not stop beaming even when he is talking about swimming through his flooded kitchen or living for weeks without plumbing or power. He moved to Texas to stay with a relative for a while but did not stay long. Texas was great. Everybody was real kind like scary kind. It was just like-- have you ever seen The Stepford Wives how everything's perfect? That is how it was. They were all like hi how are you doing? Oh can I get you anything-- clothes food? And I am like I am fine madam. Does this feel like a normal couple hours before a game or does it feel different? Way different. One thing I am going to miss before the games the pregame meals. And we do not have that here.  Them pregame meals were good all you can eat. What kind of food? Oh baked chicken with all these spices on it. It was so good. You are making me hungry. That was like a month ago. So you have stayed here this whole time. What is there been to eat for you? Oh three meals a day MREs. So what is an MRE taste like? I will tell you what. Meal number 20 and meal number 22-- 20 is spaghetti and 22 is jambalaya-- the best. I told my mama she should step it up because that stuff is-- I am going to start getting MREs just regular. All right. Hey guys. Everybody right here where these guys are. Get down. You all can take a knee or something. Let us go real quick. You can sit down or take a knee either one. It is late afternoon now about an hour before the game. Everybody gathers around Coach Compretta and he urges them to think about the past month when they get on the field tonight. Everything you have inside of you let it out. All the aggravation the frustration having to get up and do all the junk you do every day because of this hurricane let it all out right here. Play for your community OK? That is why you are here OK? Some people cannot be here. Play for the guys who cannot be here too. Play for Bay St. Louis and Waveland. Does anybody have any questions about anything-- offense defense special teams block? What? I love everybody. We love you too Cal. Love you too Cal. Of course there is only so much love one football team can take. An hour later as the team gets ready to run out onto the field the coach has this to say. So forget all the kindness and niceness right now all that junk. Go out there and get after their behinds. Do you understand me? Yes sir. OK guys. Now we do want to win the football game OK? Everybody touch somebody. Let us go. Break it down! One time win!  Ladies and gentlemen your Bay High Tigers. It is kind of hard to believe that out of the ruins of this town just down the street from gutted houses and buildings this thing has appeared this movie-set-perfect football game. It is dusk now with a pinkish sky and under the stadium lights everything's kind of glowing. And everyone showed up to play their part-- the cheerleaders the PA announcer the marching band or what is left of it a single kid with a snare drum standing in the bleachers. Please join me in singing the national anthem. The opposing team the Long Beach Bearcats line up on the other side of the field. The moment I see them my heart sinks a little. Not only are there twice as many of them they just look so determined. Assistant Coach Keith sizes them up this way.  Oh big. They came here on three buses. We need a minivan.  Big difference. And they do not have junior kids out there. We do. Not even the quarterback's father expects the Tigers to win tonight. They are missing so many guys that they will have to play their good players twice as much. Their starters will play offense and defense. Guys will wear out. Doing the kicking for the Bearcats Chip Vonderbruegge. Right there. The Tigers get off to a great start. The first time they get the ball they go on a drive that lasts half the first quarter and ends with a touchdown on a six-yard run by Robert Labat. Let us go Tigers! Let us go Tigers! I watch Tyler pass the ball off to Robert knowing that Tyler pretty much moved back to town for this moment and that Robert-- who is living with him separated from his own family-- did too. Get out there. Go go go. Watch your man! Yeah yeah! Run run run run run run run run run.  Watch your play! Tiger touchdown. Let us go D! Let us go D! Tigers on the board. Hey hey here we go. On the sidelines eight Tiger cheerleaders are jumping around. It is more than half the squad. One tells me her uniform was the first thing she packed when her family evacuated. When the girls are not cheering they are consulting this big elaborate chart they have set up in front of bleachers. Celeste the captain explains. This is our cheer list and we have 63 cheers on it. And every year we just take it and we add more to it. OK so like what is 36? 36 is G-O go Tigers go. And then what is 37? 37 is G-O go go G-O go. And what is 28? Go go G-O. Go Tigers go. There is some similarity. Yes they are very. The coaches are scurrying up and down the field improvising to fill in for the key players they do not have swapping kids in and out. Brandt the MRE kid is getting trounced out there so the coach pulls him aside. Hey Brandt. Not bad baby. Not bad baby. Make a change. Put somebody in there with a little more behind on him OK? Yeah I got manhandled right there. I know. We saw that. But the rookie players come through with some surprises. For instance at the very same moment that the coaches are grumbling to themselves about where exactly freshman Allan Vallalta is heading on the field Vallalta recovers a fumble. Oh god. Vallalta's on the way. . Oh damn. He just made a play. He just made a damn play.   By the end of the first half it is Tigers 7 Bearcats 6. Good job Walt. That a boy. Good job. The home bleachers are pretty packed by now. And the thing I realized when I start talking to people is that this is the first time this town has gotten together since the hurricane. One of the first people I meet Gary Yarborough does not even have a kid on the team. I am just out here just trying to see who is still here and who is still in town and visit with the other folks and kind of see how everybody's handling everything and dealing with everything. Is this the first time you are seeing a lot of folks in a while? Yeah some of them. Yeah. Because with the curfews and nothing open in town there is really no place to go to see anybody. As I walk through the stands the one thing people keep telling me is what a normal night this is what a relief it is to do something normal again. You talk to anyone for more than a couple minutes and what you hear next is just how far from normal everything is. They are worried about flood insurance and FEMA trailers and whether they will have jobs. I ask one man the booster club president what the highlight of the game is so far and he nearly starts to cry. Turn it up! Down on the field the Tigers are playing better than anyone had expected. Going into the fourth quarter the score is 21-6 Tigers comfortably leading. But then in the last five minutes of the game everything falls apart. The Bearcats' star player Tramaine Brock rushes for a touchdown. They miss the extra point so it is 21-12. Two minutes later with just three minutes left in the game Brock sprints 55 yards to the end zone as the Tiger coaches watch helplessly. That is it. He is gone. . He is gone. They catch another and run. They score. Ah! Dang it.  It is a two-point game now 21-19. The Tigers are still leading but Long Beach has the momentum and they only need a field goal to win. The Tigers are completely exhausted. Many have been on the field the entire game the kickers limping. Alan Vallalta the ninth grader who made that great play is on the sidelines with an injured knee. The Tigers get the ball back their last possession but they cannot even manage a first down. They punt it away and there is still plenty of time for Long Beach to score.  Do not let him behind. Do not worry about the first. Everything you have got right now! Be ready to drop. The Bearcats start to drive again. They cross the 50-yard line into Bay High territory. The clock is running down. Coaches are screaming. Jason be ready to drop. Here we go. Here we go. The place is going nuts.   I can honestly say this is the only football game I have ever been to where it really did seem to matter who won. Earlier I felt bad taking sides against the Bearcats. Their town was hit by the hurricane too. But now I do not know what I will do if the Tigers lose. Their town was hit harder. They are the underdogs. They have to win. And then they do. They stop the Bearcats. It is over.  Tiger defense. Shake it up. Shake it up. Shake it up. The clock runs out and the place explodes. 21-19 Tigers. It is every corny sports movie come to life-- people streaming on the field hugging players sprawled on the ground all these people in this wrecked town ecstatic over a football game. Assistant Coach Jeremy Turcotte. I think next to getting married and having my baby that is about the most amazing thing I have ever seen in my life. Hey guys. Listen up. I am going to let you go. I know we got to get home. Coach Compretta. Never been more proud OK in my coaching career never been more proud of a group of guys in my life than right now. Love you guys. I love you guys. Take tomorrow off. See you on Wednesday 330. Be here for 330 OK? Everybody touch somebody. Great job fellas. Great job fellas. Break it down! One time win! Bay St. Louis and Hancock County is still under a curfew ladies and gentlemen. After the game you will need to go home as soon as possible. And just like that the place clears out. A half hour later the only people left are the coaches still reliving the game. Luke one of the assistants is on the cell phone with his brother in Alabama. They had the ball with about a minute and a half left driving with no time outs. And we sacked them with no time left. But I just wanted to call and tell you that man. I will call you tomorrow sometime. I just wanted to holler at you real quick. I love you brother. Bye. Bye. Of all the coaches I met here Luke seemed the most discouraged about everything. He would lost his house. He sounded disheartened. In the morning he told me that when his contract is up in May he will probably leave here. But now his mood is different. We play next Friday night here. And it is not like the town's going to be back to normal next Friday night. So I mean they are still going to not have anything to do. There is still going to be a curfew. And I mean this just starts it. I mean if you lose tonight it is like you know what? You go home and you are sitting in a trailer and you have no AC and you lost a football game. But it is a little easier to go home and sit in a trailer with no AC when you just won a football game that nobody gave you a chance to win. Before coming to Bay St. Louis I felt the way I think a lot of us feel when we see these places on TV. I did not understand how you go back to a town like that to all that loss and live there in the middle of it. What are you going back there for and how do you even begin to get over it? Watching the Tigers win 21-19 completely outmatched everyone together cheering them on I knew the answer.   Lisa Pollak. So we checked in this week with Tigers Coach Brenan Compretta. He is not the coach anymore but is still very involved with the team. He told us that in some ways the pandemic has been harder on the high school kids in town than Katrina was. The kids facing Katrina he said could at least still hang out together. Right now the school plans to be open in the fall. The team is supposed to start summer workouts in about a week June 1 with the first game scheduled for August. That is the plan for now anyway.  Act Two Dunk and Go Nuts. So back in 1996 when Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls were at the height of their power on the way to winning the fourth of the six championships that they won back in the '90s we did an episode of our show on the Bulls and just about loving basketball. It included the story of a barber named Tommy who was the one person rooting against the Bulls in a barber shop on the South Side full of Bulls fanatics as they all watched the playoff game on television the Bulls against Shaquille O'Neal and the Orlando Magic. I like Shaq. Yeah. And they are having a rough time at the moment. Yeah. But cannot give up the shift yet. That is right. Cannot give up the shift. Even at halftime the Bulls up by 10 Tommy did not let up. Scissors in hand a toothpick dangling from his lip he declared-- Orlando's coming back win by five. It as not over till the fat lady sings. I think it was just funny to him to calmly say no to a room full of hyped-up fans. Later when the game ended and the Bulls won by 15 Tommy insisted no biggie. The Bulls would lose the coming series against Seattle. And then-- OK this is the scene I narrated back then in that show. Then we all looked up. And through the plate glass window in front of the barber shop we saw a car pull up. A guy climbs out with a brand new broom in his hand and strides towards the barber shop. He is bringing the broom to Tommy. The guy walks in and stands broom in hand near the door. What is the problem?  I told you all I was going to come back up here now. Hey Tommy. You did not think that was going to sweep huh?   It as not no sweep.  Tommy I cannot hear you man. Did you see the bull run down the street? Was Shaquille on it? The guy's name is Derek a regular at Coleman's. Tell him I got to go home and celebrate man. Me and all my Bull friend buddies we finna go celebrate. You are going to jump on the bandwagon sooner or later Tommy. We are going to make a believer out of you. Tommy's unnerved. I have already talked to Gary Payton. And boy we are going to do it in 4-2-- Gary Payton Seattle.  That episode of the show was not just about being a basketball fan. It was also about playing basketball and what it can mean to you-- and not incidentally all the trophies that you collect along the way if you are serious about the game. Further you get the bigger the trophy. Of course some trophies do not age very well. Get old enough and at some point they can just start to look like dusty aging clutter. One of our producers Nancy Updike talked to a friend of hers who played a lot of basketball all about this. When I met up with my friend Mary to talk about basketball she was having some trouble with her trophies. She just moved to a new apartment. And her new place was small so small that a bunch of high school trophies would just dominate any room they were in. She had the trophies in a box in the living room. And we sat on the floor pulling out fake silver statuettes of girls in culottes reaching ever upward hopeful and fit like in Soviet propaganda posters. See cannot you see feeling really tough walking home with something this big especially if you hold it like this? Sure. Grab that baby by the base. Yeah. Then she found one that was not like the others sort of hard to understand actually. Picture this a thick slice of wood sanded and shellacked and mounted with a miniature rim and backboard and then leaping across the front a stick figure made of roofing nails going in for a slam dunk. Mary identified this as her 1978 girls varsity team trophy from Cardinal Dougherty High School. And the girls she said had not been pleased with the trophy at all. It is ugly is not it? Yeah it is truly-- it is so damned-- We were all really unhappy. We wanted a traditional-- Will you give it to me? Yes.  I want it. I want it. We would rather have had the also ugly but much more acceptable old version of trophies then than those trophies. Oh sure. Oh sure. I mean if you are a 13-year-old girl you do not want to be walking home with that. You want that. No. Right right. That is a trophy. You want something that goes up high in the sky not something that is a slice of a tree.  You do not want a tree slice. A slice of a tree with a nail stick figure soldered together doing the one thing that you know you will never be able to do-- dunk. Was that something that you all discussed? Oh yeah. And we also thought that that was the only reason we would never be in the NBA. Luckily for us we all thought well we are really some of the best players on the face of the Earth. When you are a 16-year-old girl who is playing at a tough Catholic league school you think yeah we are good enough. I am just as good as Maurice Cheeks and the Doctor would like to play with me Dr. J. And we could attribute our lack of success in the NBA to the fact that we were girls soon to be women who had never dunked. And that is all that was keeping us from it. Mary handed me the wood slice trophy. And when I reached to touch the stick figure I realized that one of its feet was on a pivot. So I could actually make it go in for the dunk. Once I discovered this it was impossible not to do it over and over and over. The trophy was completely hypnotizing a disturbing artifact from an artistic period best forgotten. The art of the late '70s especially like in Catholic religion textbooks and churches and stuff was so ugly. Who knew there was even a genre the late '70s Catholic textbook art world that whole scene? I am afraid I have been so influenced by it. It is like you know-- I need to walk away. --those little ink drawings that are just a little bit off on purpose. You know what I mean? And the unpurposeness of it is just like you know-- It makes you want to grit your teeth. Oh help me. Yeah right right. You can always hear a Cat Stevens song playing in the background. As a kid Mary played basketball mostly with her older brother Daniel. The two of them roamed around the city together looking for pickup games whenever they could all summer every weekend-- even at night because the court down the street had lights. It was a way to get out of the house to escape the chaos of 11 kids in a working class Irish family in a too-small house on the edge of Northeast Philadelphia. Basketball was a place of clear rules and gestures that always made sense. And home was a place where you could get hit for no reason or find yourself still hungry at the end of a meal. Mary remembered being hungry a lot growing up a fact always cheerfully denied by the nuns at school. The message was you could not be hungry because your parents are saints. And they especially directed it to our family and to all the other families that had a lot of kids in them that our parents were saints because they worked so hard to provide for us. So I thought that I was just extraordinarily greedy that I would want to eat when I was
