From WBEZ Chicago it is This American Life distributed by Public Radio International. I am Sarah Koenig sitting in for Ira Glass who is off this week. To begin in the show we wanted Julie Snyder our senior producer and her husband Jeff Melman to tell the story about something that happened with Julie's hairdresser. So they came into the studio. OK I am here. You are there and he is there. And before we got into the hairdresser story Julie was trying to figure out a clever way to introduce the fact that Ira was away. She thought maybe we could do a little skit to tell people that. So she fed Jeff this line. Oh you are supposed to say so where is Ira right now. Right now? So where is Ira? No not like that. Note how quickly she shoots him down does not even wait a polite second to pretend to consider whether that was any good. That is why she is the senior producer. She keeps at him. So where is Ira? So where is Ira? Let me do it again. I told you this is-- More natural. I told you this is not my thing. So where is Ira? See. Do it just the way Sarah just said it. This is going to affect our marriage. Jeff likes to say that but in fact this will not affect their marriage. I have known them for a long time and as the President likes to say the State of the Union is strong. OK so we are here to tell you this story so we will start in on telling you the story. The story is a gossip story. That is what our show is about today gossip. And it starts like any classic of the genre in a hair salon. First of all what you need to know Sarah is that my hair color is not natural. Stop. Julie visits her colorist every six to eight weeks. They have struck up a friendship. You know how are you how are your kids blah blah blah where are you living what are you doing and stuff like that. And at one point she started telling me-- I do not know if she was broken up with her boyfriend or they were on a break but she was starting something on the side she told me with a guy who worked at a restaurant in our town. And she started describing him to me and I knew who she was talking about. I was like oh yeah that guy. He is the best looking guy that works there. And it sounded all very exciting. And then like the next time like six to eight weeks later I asked how that was going. And by then it was not going as well. But she also was like when I asked her about it she was kind of like oh shh shh shh. And sort of admonished me for asking about it in a normal tone of voice. And then she waits until it there is like nobody else around and then kneels down very quietly next to me and was just like it is just that I do not really like people knowing my business. So then Julie's hairdresser goes on to tell her some kind of embarrassing stories about the guy. And how she is not that into him any more. She might break it off maybe go back to the original boyfriend. And Julie goes home and tells all of this to Jeff which she figures is a dead-end for this top-secret information. He is unconnected. He does not know the hairdresser. There is no reason he would repeat it. The gossip is safely stored within the walls of their kitchen. So fast forward to the neighborhood Christmas party. Julie stays home with one kid but Jeff takes their daughter to the party. He is not having a good time. It is a lot of small talk with people he does not know. It is a little awkward. So using his six-year-old to escape he wanders upstairs. We were like in the kid's bedroom. Where a bunch of kids were and they were all like playing like throwing stuffed animals around. That is where I was hanging out. No because my daughter needed me to be there but because I am not a big party guy. So I do not know. So somehow I overheard these women talking. Jeff overhears the women say their sister works at the salon that Julie goes to. So he chimes in makes a connection. I think I said something like did you know about the relationship with the guy in the restaurant or something like that. I think I jumped right in. In fact they knew nothing about the guy in the restaurant. But they wanted to know everything. And then of course they were just full of joy. They were so eager to hear more. I mean I told them everything that I knew. I think I made up some stuff maybe possibly. Yeah the more I told them the more interested they were in me and the--  Oh God. --they were enjoying me. Oh my God. I could not stop. I can honestly say at no point during the conversation like while I was at the party did I think that what I was doing was not OK. Like it never felt like oh I should stop. It was great. I mean they were filling my cup--  Oh God. --lighting my cigarette for me. It was like that. I mean I just spilled it all. And then like I said when I left I was excited to go tell Julie about it. Somehow I though that she would be as excited as I was. And I was just like wait. What? Jeff thought this was no big deal at all. And I was like did the sisters know? And he was like no they did not know. They had no idea. I just could not believe why would you do that? Why would you tell them that? This is a really really big deal. Julie had seen the chess pieces lineup immediately. Her colorist has three sisters. They are close which means if they did not know about the cheating the sister very pointedly did not want them to know did not want their judgment. And she also knew that her colorist would quickly figure out that it was Julie who blabbed to Jeff who blabbed to the sisters. Which is exactly what happened. And this has stumped Julie ever since why Jeff would be so clueless? Jeff's defense is that he does not have Julie's talent for understanding the contours of gossip. He cannot feel the significance of secrets the way she does. He cannot always figure out their weight and value and danger. It is a real disability. I honestly I swear when I got home from the party I was very excited to tell Julie about this. Somehow it felt like I had done good. For some reason I thought Julie would be very pleased with me. You were like a cat bringing home a dead mouse for her to lay at her feet. I sort of thought of it as like a family victory like we really scored at this party. So I have read a little bit of like wonky academic stuff about gossip just in the last week and there is various definitions or whatever. But this one academic from Yale wrote this whole book in the '80s. And one of the things she posits actually is that gossip is-- there is extremes of gossip which are really bad like tearing somebody's character apart or very malicious gossip obviously that no one condones. But that gossip itself is a way of like making an emotional connection with people around you. And super important and really good. And that it carries an erotic power in fact. That there is something erotic in having access to information and being the one to pass something exciting on to somebody else. And I am wondering. Well I do have a lot of erotic power that is true. I could tell that. I think that is very interesting. I mean maybe some of that is tied up in it. This is really going to affect my marriage by the way. The fact is now that I hear you talk about it now it is sweet that you just loved them listening to you and laughing. The erotic power? I actually find the erotic power part to be sort of sweet. It almost makes me feel like I would do it again. Oh. No I am just kidding. We all gossip but we do not always understand its power its erotic power if you will. On today's show we have got gossip gossip and more gossip. Stories where yes the gossip can be dangerous and slanderous but also a force for good. We have got rampant gossip on another continent. And a short story about when gossipers go pro. If you want to hear what we haver heard stay with us. Part of what makes gossip gossip is that you are not supposed to do it. It is in the Bible. It is in the Koran. Jewish law prohibits it. It is considered sinful. But sometimes you have to. That is true in Malawi in southeast Africa for instance. There gossiping is of course frowned upon but not gossiping can be even worse. Hazel Namadingo is from Malawi. She is 26 and she went to college in Malawi at a place called Chancellor College where gossip was not just common it was organized. There was some kind of board where people posted gossips. It was a bulletin board in fact in the college's main library. So every morning people would rush to that board to see the latest thing that has happened around campus. What kind of gossip? What kind of gossip? That is a stupid question if I do say so myself. Because really there is only one kind of gossip you would rush to see on the bulletin board every morning. And that is of course gossip about sex. And I guess this is a good place for a listener warning that this story does discuss sex and birth control. Not graphically at all but just the existence of it. So if you are listening with kids you might want to know that. Sex as any gossiper knows is the mother of all good gossip. If you made a pie chart of gossip topics sex would have to be half the pie maybe even 34. The same was certainly true at Chancellor College. It ranged from maybe a guy being caught in the girl's hostel-- A hostel is like a dorm. --up to a girl getting grades for having sex with a lecturer. And this would be on this public bulletin board where everyone can read it? Yeah. And the university new about it? Yeah it knew but they had no control over it whatsoever. The bulletin board did eventually stop but the gossip did not. And it is not like it went underground. It was now being printed in newspapers. In like a campus newspaper you mean? So in my time we had several newspapers. We had a school newspaper which was OK. It printed a lot of stuff that you can read and benefit from. But then there was this other newspaper which a group of boys and girls would print and it was just pure gossip from first page to the last page. It had names but the foremost one was just The Tabloid. I think it was called that. Hazel says The Tabloid quote Gave too much detail to things that you would want to keep secret. Which is pretty much the best definition of a gossip rag that I have ever heard. For anyone who is gone to college or to high school or for that matter simply existed in any kind of fornicating society the stories in The Tabloid are probably familiar. Two people got together and had sex discuss. But in Malawi I am going to venture to say that this kind of gossip not to put to fine a point on it is a matter of life and death. Because in Malawi a lot of people have HIV and AIDS and so figuring out who is safe to go out with is a serious concern. Hazel works for an American run research project that is interested in how AIDS is changing the way young people in Malawi make decisions about family planning about who to marry how many kids to have. She supervises a team of researchers who interview young people three times a year to see among other things how their love lives have changed what decisions they have made about their relationships and why. And AIDS is central to all this. In Malawi everyone knows someone who is got it. How many people would you say you know or know of who are positive? In my life for sure I know three. And these are all my relatives. Yeah I know my brother is positive. I know my niece is positive. I know my brother's wife is positive. That is for sure. But for some people I just meet in my neighborhood or work with I cannot really say that I know what they are positive maybe suspect. What about the second category sort of you have heard around town? A lot like they can reach up to 50. Really? Yeah. Hazel herself is married now and has a newborn baby. But she says AIDS was a constant topic with her friends. Before they would date someone they would ask around about them and make their decision based on the gossip. It is so common to discuss whether someone's got the virus that there is shorthand for it. We have our own terms that we use to name someone who has AIDS or who is on ARVs. ARVs stands for antiretrovirals the medication that some people with HIV take. So when you want to go out with a person and your friends will say no. That one is poison. Like the person is poison you cannot go near him. Or sometimes we call or we name that person oh that one is using units. What does that mean? That means-- you know in Malawi the mobile phones that we have? This one's a little complicated. In Malawi to use a mobile phone you have to buy a card with phone units on it. And once you use them up you have to buy more to buy more time. So if a person is said to be on units that is slang for taking ARVs. They have to top-up on the medication every single day to buy more time. In Malawi just like in the US AIDS testing is confidential. So really people are usually guessing about who is infected and who is not. But where Hazel lives secrets get around pretty fast. For instance if you go to the hospital for malaria testing at the laboratory which is not all that uncommon-- Right next after they-- laboratory-- there is this room where it is written that-- ARVs. So when you see people going there queuing on the line towards the ARVs door you conclude that they are positive. So these are some of the ways how people come up with kind of gossip that so and so is positive so and so is on ARVs. ARVs are helping a lot of infected people in Malawi live a lot longer but they also complicate gossip. If a girl is beautiful for example it does not necessarily help her chances of finding a partner partly because of ARVs. Like if you see someone who is maybe a little bit fat-- Remember girls this is Africa where a little bit fat is good. Or maybe her skin is so smooth some people like put questions behind that. They do not think this person is normal. Like they have the virus. Because they look too good? Yeah they look too good. Because the ARVs can make your skin smooth? Yeah that is what most people say. That is the explanation that is going around right now. Hazel herself happens to be uncommonly beautiful and she is been the subject of rumors too. But she says her job saves her from the worst of it. Her neighbors know that her work is connected to a white person which means she is probably well paid in dollars and so can afford to take care of herself and wear nice clothes. There is an explanation for her beauty. But if you are a girl without a job who looks good and dresses expensively then you are suspect. Because that means you must be sleeping around getting money from men. Which means you could be infected. Mostly the beautiful ones are a cause of alarm. If you are not so attractive you are safe. Safe from what? You are safe to have sex with? Yeah. You have to be a bit careful about AIDS gossip though. Hazel told me you can get taken to court. That is someone can bring a case against you to the local chief if you accuse them of having AIDS. And if you do not have proof which almost no one does you can get fined. It is understandable being accused of having AIDS when you do not that is a rumor that is a very very hard to shake. And it can ruin your life. In Malawi Hazel says it is among the top three things you do not want to be accused of. The other two are being a witch and practising satanism. So while no one exactly condones gossiping where Hazel lives everyone knows that sometimes it is required. Take the case of this one neighbor of Hazel's a young woman. She used to be good looking but then she lost a lot of weight. Rumors started that she had AIDS and that she was going out with a couple of men in town. When the gossip got back to her she started keeping to herself not really leaving the house or doing the normal things she liked to do. Until finally she went to the hospital and got on ARVs saved herself. But the danger for the men in town is that now she does not look like she has AIDS at all. Her disease is hidden. She is a one-woman public health threat. The thing is when men see her now like she is healthy. She got back a little bit of weight and you really cannot tell that she has AIDS. So I would say it is really tricky. Like to say in this way is gossip good for her was it good for the society? Was it bad for her was it bad for the society? But I would still say for her it was good because it made her make that decision which she would not have made if people were not gossiping about her. But for many in our society I think it is not good. Because now she is healthy and more attractive than she was. So if someone new came to the neighborhood maybe someone you liked or became friends with her or was a relative and said oh look at your attractive neighbor. I think I would like to ask her out. Would you gossip and say look I know she looks good but she is got the virus you should know that. Or do you feel like you cannot gossip that way because it is too possibly harmful for her? What is the right thing to do? I think I will gossip because of seeing the way she looked before. Yeah I will tell my share of the gossip that I have heard. You could call it gossiping. Or you could call it using your social network to educate those around you about how AIDS works and how to avoid getting it. That is what a sociologist named Susan Watkins would call it. Because what Hazel's been doing all this time with her friends and family all the gossiping that is the basis for a huge research project. Watkins along with colleagues and grad students has spent more than 10 years looking at how people's social interactions including their gossip shape their attitudes about AIDS first in Kenya then Malawi. She spends about two months a year in Africa. She was initially researching family planning but her field work kept getting interrupted by funerals. Sometimes local people were going to three or four a week of people who died of AIDS. So she switched to focus on AIDS. Watkins started researching people's sexual behavior the way most sociologists do with surveys. But the information respondents were giving her was not all that accurate. After all she was an outsider. A stranger holding a clipboard. People did not want to tell her all the details of their sex lives. To figure out what rural Malawians really thought Watkins needed to hear what they said to each other when she was not around. She needed to eavesdrop. So she hired local people she knew to keep journals. So I just said why do not you just listen. Wherever you go in the course of your daily life if you hear anybody talking about AIDS just listen and then go home later in the evening and write it down. And write it down as specifically as you can in exactly the words that they used. She ended up with thousands and thousands of pages of preserved public gossip written by hand in school notebooks and spanning more than a decade. Conversations at markets funerals bars churches water wells. And the contents were surprising. The journals bucked much of the conventional wisdom about how rural Malawians were dealing with the AIDS epidemic on the ground. I realized that what these conversations these gossip that was going on as people talk to each other about did you see so and so is looking thin? Or did you see so and so? She is got shingles and so she probably has AIDS? That there was just a lot of talk going on. And what was the prevailing wisdom among researchers about the way this was getting talked about or not talked about it in a place like rural Malawi? Well the prevailing view was not so much that of the researchers as that of the prevention community. Which would be the NGOs and the donors that were contributing money to have campaigns that would stem the tide of the epidemic. And their prevailing wisdom was that people do not talk about AIDS. It is a taboo topic. They do not talk about sex. And the Malawian elites who work for the NGOs said that as well. No our people do not talk about AIDS and do not talk about sex. But of course we found out right away that they do. And they talk a lot. And they say very pertinent things to HIV prevention. I have to say having read a bunch of excerpts of the journals that was the thing that surprised me immediately was they talk about sex all the time. There was one wonderful conversation that I did not send you which was some guys in a trading center just a little market area standing around and talking. And one of them says Hey guys I have got-- What he is got is a little too graphic for public radio. So let us just say he is got an infection. And the other guys say Well what is it? And he said Well I do not know what it is. And they said Well maybe your underwear is too tight And he said No my underwear is not too tight. And then they said Well maybe you have got a crack in your foreskin? And he said No I have looked at my foreskin and I do not have a crack there. And then another guy chimed up and said You know I think this might be gonorrhea. And if it is gonorrhea you better get it treated very quickly. And then somebody else jokingly said And if you have gonorrhea it is going to smell and green flies are going to follow you. And then they all roared with laughter. And then they said Well how do you think you got it? And the guy said I do not know. He said Because I am faithful to my girlfriend and she is faithful to me. And at that point the guys laugh raucously and say Well if that is the case you could not possibly have what you have. So if it is not you it must be your girlfriend. So you ought to get rid of her. You ought to divorce her. And the guy says Oh I cannot divorce her. He says I have bought her already three pair of jeans at the PEP store in Blantyre and two blouses and a pair of sandals. So clearly he had made an investment in this woman and was not yet ready to give her up. Unfortunately we do not know the end. I think actually did read that one. And he also says No I love her. He loves her. No I love her. And anyway I bought her all this stuff exactly. And he also says if I remember Well if she is got it I already have it anyway. And if she has HIV I have already got it then anyway so what is the point of giving her up. Exactly. That is a major misconception among Malawians-- and also I have worked in Botswana and Swaziland and there I think it is all over-- that they vastly overestimate the probability of transmission in a single act of intercourse with an infected person. About 97 of our respondents said it was certain or highly likely. And that is far from the truth. It is actually quite difficult to transmit HIV. But the people believe that. If you lie together you die together they say. So that allows this guy to say well there is no point in breaking up with her. And it also allows people to say well there is no point in my getting tested. I must be positive. I just had so many girlfriends. Oh that is interesting. Because I was thinking maybe having that level of fear like even one time and I am doomed might be kind of good. Like telling your kids you will get pregnant if you have sex even one time as a preventive thing. But you are saying it actually can have the other affect too which is making you blase. Yeah why would you use a condom. Nobody likes to use a condom. So if you are sure you are already infected no way would you use a condom. Anyway the women do not want to use condoms. Right nobody seems to like the condoms. There is one quote that I love. That it said using a condom oh it is like eating sweets in a wrapper. Yeah that is all over Africa. And everybody tells it. They like slap their knee as if they are the first ones who ever told it. You cannot eat sweets in a wrapper. And then they go ho ho ho. But it is absolutely all over the place. It is funny every time. Yeah funny every time. The other thing that I noticed reading them or it just occurred to me is that there seems to be a lot of gossip around a lot of gossip around. And I am thinking like is that different from us? And then I thought nah probably not. But the level of it was really-- I was like man alive. You really got to be careful what you say and do I mean because people are watching. These are small communities with houses close to each other. They are mud huts with thatched roofs just like you see in National Geographic pictures of rural Africa. And I think because their houses are dark there is not electricity people spend a lot of time outside. And that probably makes gossip happen more than if everybody is in their house with a half an acre yard around it. And they have to walk a lot of places to get water to go to the market. So there is just a lot of conversation all the time. Yeah. They use these stories to launch discussions about how they can prevent themselves from getting AIDS. Saying well this person surely got AIDS because he said he would never use a condom. Whereas this person probably got AIDS through his wife because she used to be married to so and so who died of AIDS. Because gossiping about these people is really the only way to find that stuff out right? Yeah and in fact they sometimes when the men are gossiping or talking they say Timun died of AIDS but he died because he did not ask us. He did not tell us he wanted to go with this partner and ask us for our opinion. If he had done that we would have told him that she used to be married to Matthew and Matthew worked in South Africa and came back with AIDS and died of it. So we would have told him no do not go for her. But he did not ask us so it is really his own fault. He knows better than that. I was really struck by a one of Simon's entries from 2003. I just was really struck by-- so this woman walks by and they just diagnose her on the fly and then it launches this whole thing. And I am wondering if you could just read that? It is your summary of what he is written partly your summary and partly his words I think. The journalist has gone to the trading center which is a small market to buy soap for his wife and fish for lunch. He chats with a fish vendor who is a friend of his and then they both chat with a customer who has sores on her face. Once she leaves they are joined by a neighboring vendor who had been listening. Together they diagnose the woman's condition as shingles which they interpret as a symptom of AIDS. They justify this diagnosis by providing a narrative of her sexual history. She is had four marriages all ending in divorce because she was unfaithful. They then speculate as to whether her unfaithfulness was due to a need for money for her children or to lust. And why in these days of the epidemic any man would select her as a sexual partner. One man went on saying that she is on the way to the graveyard. This is not a time of playing with men by doing sex with them. Neither should men be playing with women by doing sex with them. We chatted and chatted and finally we concluded by saying that nowadays it is better to just stop going with other sexual partners. It is better that whenever you want sex you should select a bar girl because one cannot think of having plain sex with a bar girl. Everyone knows that any bar girl has AIDS and therefore everyone having sex with her protects himself by using condoms. We chatted and chatted until I just bought the fish and left. And just to be clear when he says one cannot think of having plain sex with a bar girl plain sex means sex without a condom? With no-- yeah right. I love how these back to back ideas of well you should just not sleep around. And if you are going to sleep around you should choose a bar girl because we know she is a slut so you are going to use a condom. There was one wonderful debate where somebody said well if we have to select partners we should go with school girls because they will not be infected. And then somebody else says no the school girls are all infected by the teachers. What you should really do is go for an ugly woman because nobody else will have gone for her so she is less likely to be infected. What surprised you the most when you started getting these back and reading through them like stuff you just did not expect to see? I had some expectations before hand because I would done a little bit of this in Kenya. So it was not quite as striking to me the Malawi journals as they would be to you. But the variety of places that people talked about AIDS. How sometimes it was just looking out the window. Somebody is on a bus they look out a window they see somebody thin and the bus starts talking about it. Sometimes the bus driver gets into the story. I had not really appreciated these group aggregate like buses people on a bus. And a lot of the things we learned including this were against the conventional wisdom. That people do not talk. They do not talk about sex. It is taboo. That they are fatalistic. Well you can tell from these excerpts that they are not fatalistic. Wait so some of the prevailing thought was that people in these communities just assume they are going to get AIDS and die? So there is nothing they can do about it? That was the fatalism? Yeah or another bit of the conventional wisdom was that they were in denial. They are just going on as if AIDS did not exist. They do not want to believe it so they do not believe it. But we see from the journals that they do believe it. And they do feel that they themselves are at risk. But then added to that-- and something that is not at all in the agenda of the prevention community-- is partner selection. And they advise each other to be careful. Before you select a partner ask around see what her behavior is see who knows her. But has any of that prevailing wisdom that you have talked about that you think is wrong how is that then effecting prevention programs? If you start with that premise then what did it mean about the programs? Well it meant that they did some programs that were not necessary. Because they were telling them to talk about AIDS when they were already talking about AIDS. Oh so they were trying to encourage this kind of discussion and you are saying it was already underway? It was already under way. Or they were trying to inform people that AIDS is here. Well you have seen yourself they have known that for a long time. So I think what that stuff did was justify spending money on things that to be fair the prevention community thought would be important because they did not know what was going on outside of their offices basically. When you have talked about the contents of these journals and what they show has the response changed? Has programming responded to your research? No. I do not think so. The problem says Watkins is that Malawi depends on outside money for AIDS prevention big donors and NGOs. And so to make sure that money keeps coming the Malawi government tailors its AIDS prevention strategies to whatever the international trends are. Even if those trends are based on assumptions about real Africans that are not necessarily true. You have to be sympathetic to somebody sitting in Washington DC at the offices of USAID. How are they going to know what goes on? What they know generally about rural Malawians comes through the Malawian elites largely because those are the people they interact with. And they have very strong views. And so for the elites AIDS is spread by people who are not like us. AIDS is spread by superstitious backward villagers. And AIDS is spread by sex workers. And AIDS is spread by sugar daddies. So there is some of these usual suspects. And even when there is very strong evidence against those they just do not believe it. Let me give you an example. Where nobody ever says the problem the driver of the epidemic is men with money. And yet the evidence shows very clearly that the highest prevalence is among the wealthiest and most educated men. I know. But when I suggest well why do not we go after the elite men? People just look at me like I am totally nuts. I think it is just seen as an impossibility. It is seen as men's nature. So it is better to try to train women to negotiate condom use and to protect themselves than it is to pay any attention to the men. If it were up to her she said she spend every penny of AIDS prevention money on the one new thing that is been proved effective scientifically that is on male circumcision. I can see the meeting now. The 72-year-old white woman sits down with Malawi's health minister various other government and NGO officials in suits and tells them forget the prostitutes and bar girls. You all need to go get yourselves circumcised. Good luck with that. Susan Watkins is a professor at UPenn and a visiting research scientist at The California Center for Population Research at UCLA.
