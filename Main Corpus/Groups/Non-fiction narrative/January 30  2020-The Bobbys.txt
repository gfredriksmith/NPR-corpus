     Okay.   You know what else I was thinking about?   What?   We are well into the 21st century. I think of myself as a 20th-century boy.   Hmm.   Like I am -- I am a 19-something-something. 19-this 19-that. 1956 1960. So to be 2020 that is like well into the next one.   Oh you mean well into the 21st?   Yeah right.   Okay. Oh and you think of yourself as the 20th?   Yeah so I feel a little like deep in a foreign land called the future.   Robert you are a man for all seasons.   I know but you asked me the question.   Hey. Jad Abumrad. This is Radiolab. So as we said at the beginning of the last episode here at the end of the month Robert will be retiring from the show. It is just something that he and I have been talking about for a while. It is something we have been talking about with the staff for a while. And for the last few months we have been trying to figure out as a team like how do we send him off? What is the right way to say goodbye? And we decided let us interview him you know? The way he and I have interviewed thousands of people over these last 17 years working together. So I made a list of questions.   You have written them down on your phone?   I have. I have prepared for this conversation as I would any other.   I suppose. That is very professional of you.   All these different questions about the places he likes to go in the city there was a series of questions about Robert and dating apps which I am not gonna explain. But it was actually the first question I had written down that ended up taking us down some unexpected paths.   So let me just ask you What are The Bobbys?    The Bobbys is a little bit of a quirk. I decided at some point ...   Well your name is Robert.   That is right.   We sometimes call you Bobby.   That I would create an award like the Oscars which I would name after myself.   Yeah.   Called The Bobbys.   When did the -- when was the first Bobbys?   I think it was in the early '70s. And I was thinking of awarding things that I -- and the rules about the Bobbys were I would have a audience experience. I am the audience and I would then award the person who created that experience a Bobby. And the difference between me and the Oscars and some of the lesser awards is that I would award the creator of it whenever he or she did the act of creation was not important it was when I consumed it.   I see.   So you could have a Bobby in which Judy Garland you know for playing a role she played in 1939 would be up against somebody who played a movie that was like two weeks old.   So Charles Dickens could get a Bobby.   Well Charles Dickens would always get a Bobby. This caused all kinds of problems because there were certain people ...   How do you give Charles Dickens a Bobby?   Charles Dickens well as soon as he would walk into the room with a book like all the other authors would say Well I do not see why we even have to write books anymore. But so I would -- then my wife decided that I had -- because I have always had a very very weak memory system I found myself awarding things that mostly I had consumed in the very end of October early November the awards being given in Thanksgiving. And I could not remember anything that I had seen in January February or the previous December. So she is decided to give me a Bobby book.   Oh!   You brought the Bobbys book.   I did.   Producers Bethel Habte and Matt Kielty had Bobby K. bring in his Bobby book.   It is a black book with a red binding. It has in gold a picture of the Bobby statue which is Bobby with To all the winners written in it. So it starts in 1977. This ripped page was because one of the consultants my wife got so angry at me for not incl -- letting her be part of the deciding group that she ripped in a temper tantrum the page out which then ...   Why will not -- why did not you let her be part of the process?   Because it is the Bobby book not the Bobby and others book. That is so -- that -- this here is just anger frozen in time and place here. '77 seems to have only winners it does not seem as there is any contestants. Lives of A Cell by Lewis Thomas won Book of the Year. Still Crazy After All These Years by Paul Simon won Song of the Year. Friendly Fire from The New Yorker by C.D.B. Bryan won Best Magazine Article of the Year. Somebody named Hieglen who wrote Climbing Swiss Mountain in the New Yorker won Best Short Story of the Year and Annie Hall by Woody Allen won Best Movie of the Year. For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Not Enough won the Play of the Year. The Ritzy Forte Award was not awarded that year. The Ritzy Forte is the name of the special award for the best cartoon of the year.   No winners that year.   None. So that is 1977. And then 19 ...   Could you do my year? Can you do ...?   Yeah what is your ...?   1990.   1990.   The years passed and I would put in the winners.   Play of the Year Six Degrees of Separation by John Guare.   To all the different categories.   1979. Best Book of the Year The Press by A.J. Liebling. Performance By An Actress Fernanda Montenegro. Best Movie of 2005.   Oh you were a big fan of The Notebook.   I was. I cried during The Notebook.   And I would announce them sometimes to the winners themselves which is always a little bit of a mixed sort of thing. And then ...    I can imagine.   And in my mind of course there is a red carpet and it is flush and there is you know there is a tremendous ba-da-da-da-da of Paparazzi.   No wait. Can I ask you a question?   Yeah?   So when you were awarding Bobbys was it always to esteemed people? Was it to the ...   No no!   Or could it be to just Joe who makes a really good falafel.   Yeah it could be to Joe.   Verdi's Requiem as sung at Andy Krulwich's birthday. Oh this is my first cousin when he turned 60 rented a chorus and sang the bass part in Verdi's Requiem.   But there are other things. Like I -- there are some things where I give a just a special tribute for a -- like a kind of lifetime achievement award kind of thing.   Oh really?   To various architects and cartoonists. And ...   Also there is moments.   Bobby moments!   Bobby moments are moments in my life that year where I had a feeling of just glory or just joy or ...   Can you read some of the others Robert?   Yeah.   Let us see. 2000 in Times Square. Yeah ew. Redwood forest. That is with my wife. What else do you see there?   One says at my mother's bed April 2007.   That is when she died.   That was a -- why was that a moment for you to be -- like what was ...   Well she was watching Jeopardy and I hired a person to take care of her that night and I walked about seven blocks and I got a phone call. She was doing really well on Jeopardy and the lady who had never met my mother phoned and said I think your mother just died. So I ran back and she was dead. And you know that was completely a shock. I mean she was sick but -- and she said -- she was kept saying I am gonna die but she was into that sort of thing from -- for at least around -- and so there she was. She was dead. And I sat on the bed looking at a woman who still warm and it was my mother. You know that was quite a -- that was a moment. The moments do not have to be like always pleasant. They can just be searing or you know things that you never will forget.   Are you telling me though that moments before she passed away she was answering Jeopardy questions correctly?   Yes can you imagine? That is a really great way to go.   Kicking ass at Jeopardy?   She was doing really well at Jeopardy.   But as I got older it gets really a bit surreal as -- as it got into the -- into the more recent years it gets alarming because the book begins to run out of pages. I was getting down to the last 13 pages.   This is the same book from '77?   Yeah.   It -- when it gets to 2018 the book stops. Like they were out of pages. So I said to my daughter Look Nora if the Bobby book ends in 2018 does not it follow perhaps as the night the day that your father will end in 2018? So she ran to the deepest Brooklyn and found a bookbinder and said Could you like double the Bobby book and rebind it?   So my father could live longer.   So my father could live longer. So now look at this. This is -- this just means that you are gonna have to deal with me for all these years.   Are you troubled that she did not add even more pages?    It looks like it covers 'til about 2055.   Yeah you might be -- yeah 20 ...   By then I will be like 90-something. So I am -- in 2047 I will be 100 so I do not really think I want to go that far. So this looks just about right actually. And then it will have the feeling perhaps unless I get run over by a truck of like you know pretty much being a life well-lived or rather well-consumed with all of these rewards.   It is also compressing like your whole -- like the adult years into like a tiny book which makes it feel a lot shorter and smaller than it actually was. Like ...   Well there is -- and I mean that is an interesting subject to me. Like there is a fellow who invented a thing called mathematica. He is -- he lives in New Jersey at Princeton. And he loves to just measure himself. So he will send me the number of times he touched the letter T during the month of May on his computer. Or the amount of hours that he slept the amount of hours that he ate the amount of hours that he show -- showered the amount of hours that he was on the telephone for the whole year you know worked out. And then he sends me all these bar graphs and stuff. But different people -- you know different people reflect differently about themselves. And you know for a person who is very mathematical like this guy it makes sense to him a deep sense that he can be expressed in data points. And I do not know. He feels them the way I guess a great mathematician loves pattern feels. So he sees the pattern of himself. In my case this is called when I enjoyed myself extravagantly whether it was reading or going to see something or having an experience or well I felt the intensity of being alive that is a different kind of measure. And someone else would you know write a memoir or a letter to their grandchildren called Well I remember when your grandpa -- So there is thousands of ways to do this and to some degree this is not the most flattering thing my particular form of compression. Either it is a self-help book to keep me you know comfortable in my very old age on the Atlantic City boardwalk. That is the -- that is what I prefer to think of it as. But viewed another way it is a person who never much left his own circle of joy and just stayed inside himself and flattered himself right down to death. That is less of a good advertisement for oneself. Or this might be just you know someone with a deep learning disability taking notes.    Live from 85th Street and 8th Avenue in New York City it is the 45th Annual Bobby Awards with your host the judge juror and executioner Robert Bobby Krul ...   Wait. Have you ever done anything yourself where you quietly think it should win a Bobby?   No.   Or does that violate the very rules of the Bobbys?   Well it also goes to something that I just feel which is like I -- I have been really lucky up to a degree that I can really -- cannot quite understand. I have had a chance to go into one place after another and some of them quite straight places like ABC News and Frontline places like that and I have pushed it so that I could do what I like to do which is to explore sometimes from a not particularly sophisticated place what I am looking at. And it is fact -- it is sort of always been a sense that I have had that I must have been a little bit slower than everybody else and I felt that way and I thought Well maybe what I could do is I could take that slowness and turn it into an advantage. Because for many subjects depending upon who you are it could be ice hockey or it could be economics or it could be irregular verbs in French or whatever that most people know nothing at all. So if you want to talk about irregular verbs you might have to say Here's what a verb is and why would you use the word irregular. And what is a regular verb?   Yeah.   The ordinary questions. I have always done that but it is never seemed to me to be the champagne of work. It just seems to me to be the -- my -- my daily business.   That being said Robert ...   Mm-hmm.   What we have decided to do as a staff is that we are gonna honor you my friend with some Bobbys. Of course it is not within our -- we are not ...   You cannot.   We cannot do that.   No! That is completely illegal and the committee would simply tell you to go home.   No no but we are gonna do a hyphenated Bobbys. We are gonna do Jaddy-Bobbys.   Jabobs.   All sorts of staff Bobbys. These are -- these are Bobbys where the -- where these are awards Bobbys given to you moments throughout your career and moments throughout your -- your tenure with Radiolab.   I do not know if this entirely pleases me.   I -- well no. I think it is gonna -- it is gonna be -- I mean look we -- we have spent 17 years together.   Yes we have.   I would say at least a decade of it separated by this two feet of Plexiglas.   Yes.   And there have -- we have created a lot of radio moments. And so we are gonna honor some of them with Bobbys.   Okay.    Tonight the inaugural Bobby-Jaddy Bobby-Staff Bobbys Awards Show with your host and presenter Jad Abumrad. The first category Best Pre-Radiolab Story.         Well so okay. I have a little bit of -- as a presenter there is so many stories pre-Radiolab stories one could nominate for a Bobby. The -- the judges have ...   Well who are the judges? This is like a gang?   Rachael Cusick has chosen the -- and she was the judge in the pre-Radiolab category. So this is a Cusick-Bobby.   Mm-hmm.   Okay so ...   Have you ever wondered where the word 'turkey' comes from? Sure you have.   There are many turkey stories to choose from apparently.   We asked Robert Krulwich to find out and here's his report.   Well like a lot of things in this world the turkey got its name entirely by mistake.   Oh I did a lot of Thanksgiving ones yes.   Turkey. Turkey. Turkey. You would think that the turkey has suffered enough.   But do not you want to hear the end of the mystery of the turkey story?   Uh we are running out of time Robert.   All right. Well let me just tell -- let me just finish my mystery.   Okay.   You have always been big on -- on the anniversary stories.   No you know why? Because the holiday season in commercial television and even on NPR gives you a chance to do anything you like inside the category.   No I know. I remember you have -- you did a -- just a whole slew of stories around Mother's Day.   Yes. Like thousands.   And you would -- I remember when in the early part of our -- of our -- the radio -- when you were just coming on for the first time.   Yeah.   You would always be like Oh we could do it for Mother's Day. And I would be like We do not -- we do not do that Robert.   I know. We do not do that.   We do not do the anniversaries.   No. But see those anniversaries are the days when -- when you are allowed to put any -- that is when you put not newsy things onto the news. Like the news people say what just happened what just happened what just happened. And then on Mother's Day they go Mommy. So that is an always category and then you get to do always.   Yeah I know.   See that is -- that is -- that is why those things are useful.   Well so the winner of Best Pre-Radiolab story has nothing to do with Mother's Day or with turkeys. It is in fact a story from 1977 ...   NPR's Robert Krulwich saw some strange markings on the back of a five dollar bill and he investigated.   That we are calling Five Dollar Bill.   As soon as she came into the room I smelled trouble. This dame had a nose like a toothpick on a face like an olive. She was tough she was smart and she had a problem. I could tell. I am a private eye. I told her I had nothing but time.   Lady I got nothing but time.   She took out a 5 bill laid it on my desktop smoothed it out real flat and then she spoke.   This here's a 5 bill.   I could see it was and I said so.   Lady I can see that.   She took a long drag on her Silverthin and I got a whiff of her Chanel.   Look Chuck.   She called me Chuck though my name is not Chuck. But I like that in a woman.   Chuck I like privacy.   Yeah?   I got an unpublished number.   Yeah?   I got an unpublished address.   Yeah?   I got blank plates for my Bentley.   Yeah?   I am like what the fuck is going on?   This is a -- this is what those film noir things sounded like to me.   I know but it is like what -- okay so only does one discover ...   I have not heard that in a really long time.   ... about three-quarters of the way through this that the whole piece is about some mysterious secret message in a bush?   Shadows in a bush. Yes.   On the back of a five dollar ...   Some 92 something something 92. Yes.   There was numbers written on the bush ...   Yes.   ... next to the Lincoln Memorial.   There was a theory that the artist you know the Bureau of Engraving hires humans artists to design it. And so I was tipped or must have read in a collectors magazine who knows that the five dollar bill contained a secret number and all I had to do was look for it. And when I was shown where it was I could not not see it. It was always there. So that is a perfect radio story. You get -- make everybody listening to you take out their five dollar bill and see the thing that they will see. Because I saw it and ...   But it was not actually numbers on the back of the five dollar bill.   Yes it was. If you choose to see the shadows that way.   No because you use one piece in a -- in a five and a half minute story you use one six-second bit of tape of some actual person.   Okay.   Who is looking at the -- at the five dollar bill not seeing the number.   Oh not seeing it.   Not seeing the number. He sees a different set of numbers than you see.   Okay.   And you argue about what numbers are there. Which leads me as a listener to believe that actually it was not ...   It was not as obvious as I remember.   No. That it was maybe ...   Well you have me at a disadvantage because that was like 40 35 years ago. But ...   But what is amazing about this is that it is -- it is so entire -- like the whole point of it seems to be for you ...   To play all those characters.   To play all those characters. It does not seem ...   Well also it was a chance I guess for me to make a film noir like of my own. I could just make one of the Humphrey Bogart movies for myself.   I just think that is amazing that you are -- you are -- you go -- that I do not even know what the story's about until three quarters of the way through but I am still riveted.   Yeah. Well I think it is a little magical to me when you listen to NPR these days to remember that when National Public Radio started it A was not much listened to was not highly-esteemed that is very important and did not have any money. Those three things put them together and they had a 90-minute show to do every single day. And there were things that we used to do on All Things Considered that you know I do not think would -- I think they would make people's -- people poop in their pants if they heard them now.   The next category Best Improvisation.    Best Improvisation.   Because one of the things that I -- one of the things certainly that I will always -- see I always have were it not such a cliche I think we would do -- we could do the best blooper reel of any show in the history of media. But mostly when you get on a -- when you catch a wind on something.   Like Dan da da Dan da da. Dan DeLaurio.   No Dan Dilly -- what is it? Don? Dan -- Doral D. Denny or something?     Sometimes I feel relieved that you have -- that you have -- that you have to endure some of these little tics. Just -- maybe you are like a Touretter and -- you know and when you hear like too many consonants in a row you just cannot get them out of your head and just repeat them. And poor Jad has to listen to them in the studio over and over again.   Better yet they are -- they are immortalized on tape.   So you saved some of those?   Oh yeah. There is so many. So I think that the -- one of the nominees is a consonant pileup.   Battle bird battle between Bethel Bethel -- it is a bird battling with Bethel and beauty. It is the B Show! Bob and Bethel battling about birds and beauty on Badiobab.    There was some throat-clearing singing.   High C. High C. High C. High C. Father and son. They have their own company. Yes they do. Is that the line I needed to do?   Yeah that was the line.   And they are in a family business. Yes.   Well the winner in this category I believe is Slinky Credits.   Slinky credits?   Thanks. Big thanks to Steve Strogatz Professor of Mathematics at University of Colorado which is not really where he is teaching because it is called Cornell but it is those C colleges you know Connecticut and Connecticut College and Community Community of Kansas which is with a C. The C kind of Kansas. Those are all the colleges we like to think of as The Big C. C is for Cookie that is good enough for me. I am Robert Krulwich.      Big thanks to Steve Strogatz who is a Professor of Mathematics at Cornell University. His new book is called The Big X.   Joy of X!   Or The Joy of X which is like The Joy of Sex but it is missing the S.   And the E.   And the E.   And the fun.   And the fun.   And the sex.   And the sex! But you get the last letter which is of course the only thing that really matters. As many copulating couples have always said at the end you know just before the cigarette I really liked the X part. And I think we all agree with that.    That is going right in there. That is funny.   Now so what is the ...?   Joy of X.   Yeah. Joy of X. Big thanks to Steve Strogatz who is a Professor of Mathematics at Cornell University in Ithaca New York. And he is the author of a new book called The Joy of X. And to the Slinky Company manufacturers of fine coiled objects worldwide.  in every one of your local Target stores.   Okay! You are such -- you are such a weirdo!    Yeah.   Oh my God.   So that was the winner in the category of the Best Improvisation.   Uh-huh.   Okay so in the next category this one is I think a little bit more pertinent to the spirit of the show.   Best Question.   To -- to set this one up you have heard me say this before. One of the most kind of amazing qualities of working with you is that you always consistently ask a question that I would never think to ask but then suddenly must know the answer to. And in this case it was one of these things that you threw out in the middle of an interview and it became the basis for the best-loved moment in our most downloaded show of all time.   Oh this is the shrimp.   The shrimp. So we were talking to this scientist asking him all these questions about how we perceive color and how color is sort of outside of us and yet we only make sense of it internally. And in the middle of this interview you just tossed out ...   Well here's a question. If a dog and a human and a crow were to be staring at a rainbow would they be seeing very different things?   And that was it.   Yeah. I remember that.   I was just like -- I remember the -- there was that -- when you asked that question all of a sudden we were like Huh? Would they see the same rainbow? Would they be doing -- but I remember we lived with the question for a long time.   Mm-hmm.   And then what ends up happening of course is that I go up to this church on 33rd and 8th.     120 people sing the colors of the rainbow and it was a funny thing. It is a funny thing to be standing up there in this beautiful church ...   We need -- we need B flat on top of the F.   ... conducting all these people as they are singing and think all of this began with some weird moment in a studio where Robert asked the question. Like your questions so often lead to the weirdest stuff.   Well that is nice though right? Like it is -- like it is nice that we can -- we can get loose enough to go where someone maybe has never gone before or at least -- or at least we have not gone before.   Yeah.   I think that is really -- it is one of the things I am gonna miss is that -- that -- I mean listening to that guy who was the five dollar bill like that was -- like that was me sort of delivering my idea of what a you know a 1929 or 1939 detective Marlowe story would be like. But I kind of worked it out in my head as I -- as I did it. With us I -- I never knew what was gonna happen.   Yeah.   It really was an improvisation.   That is what I am gonna miss actually.   Yeah. Like that is what is really ...   It is that thing ...   Where does this go?   It is like -- yeah. It is like that thing of I still cannot after 18 years predict what you are gonna say.   Nor can I.   Or what you are going to find interesting.   Yeah.   You know?   Well sometimes I can insist that it is interesting and you will not -- Like snail sex has been the -- has been the thing that is separated us for so many years.   No I am never gonna get there. It is -- it is a line in the sand.   You are so wrong too.   Literally in the sand.   I do not know why there is just something wrong with you that you do not feel that that is so worth investigating.   Maybe that should have been the last story we did.   The last story should have been snail sex yeah. I do not know but that would have been ...   Okay. Well give me your best pitch. What is so damn interesting about snail sex?   Everything.   Go.   These are two ardent ardent loving animals. The sex is slow because they are hermaphrodites. So they are both male and female. Now this is hard for us to understand but imagine if you were both the male and the female in a tryst with a animal that was also a male and a female. So part of your boy part wants part of their girl part part of your girl part wants to avoid part of their boy part and all of this takes a lot of thinking. It is also ...   You mean just like who -- who is ...   I am going to hug you here but do I want to hug -- do I want to be hugged down there? I -- and this is like in the same individual because snails are both male and female at the same time. So that is hard and then the fact that you are doing it under the sun under the sky. And who is in all the trees above them? The -- the animals that want to eat them because they have no -- they have no way to protect them they have to leave their shells to have the sex. So ...   So it is slow.   ... you are exposed you are slow.   It is confusing.   You are in danger. It is confusing. And you do it anyway.   That sounds like all -- all species.   It is especially -- I think when sex wanted the poster child for -- from the animal kingdom to like when we are good when sex is as good as it gets who knows it? Snails do.   There. You did it. You did it. Okay. So where are we going with this?   I do not know.   Onto the next category I guess.   Okay.   Okay next category. Best laugh.   Best laugh.   Yeah. This is -- I mean we are gonna give you a Bobby for having the best laugh of all the humans.   There was a good -- there was a lot of things to laugh about that is for sure.   Yeah. So I believe our announcer David Gebel has the nominees for this category.   The nominees for best laugh. Snort. Hearty laugh. Chortles. High laugh. Yucks. Laugh with insight. Quiet chuckle. Strange chortle. Natural laugh. Social laugh. Santa laugh. Whisper laugh. Uncontrollable laugh while reading ad copy.    Hi I am the future at heart. I am supported by Target line presenting to you the future at heart in Washington New York City and a million more.  This says so little so badly. But we will try again and I am trying to get myself sober here. Hi I am Robert Krulwich. Radiolab is supported by Target. Presenting .      I do have trouble reading some of those ads. Like there were some weird copy in those ads.   Oh my God. So that last one was our winner. But do you want to know something though about the laughs?   Mm-hmm?   So like back in the early days of the show so much of the show was being put together in the edit. And what we would end up having is like chunk of Robert-Jad conversation chunk of Robert-Jad conversation chunk of Robert-Jad conversation and there would be these big gaps between them. And we would need to replace with other conversations. And so I would scratch in the connecting tissue which occasionally like would mean having to say something that you would -- that you would chuckle to or react to. So what we did at a certain point is we -- we went through a bunch of interviews combed through plucked out a bunch of your reactions and laughs and various things and put all of them into a folder. And so I have had this folder of your laughs for about 10 years.   Really?   Yeah. And I have a folder of your laughs. I have a folder of your affirmative reactions. Your negative reactions. I have yes's no's. Oh my God I have a whole folder of Hmm.    You do?   I have a whole folder of those. But I would take your laughs like when I was editing really late at night and I was really stuck and I was very disheartened as one gets at 00 a.m. when you are trying to make a story work and it is just not working. And I would just -- I would put all your laughs in iTunes and I would just play them back to back and it would cheer me up.   Really?   Yeah. I would -- it would cheer me up and it would make -- it would remind me that we are making a conversation. Because sometimes you forget that when you are editing. You start to make ...   Oh that is very nice to know.   Yeah. So that folder of laughs is very very important to me.   The therapeutic laughing folder.   Hmm.   Yeah. Wow.   So I think what we are gonna do we do not have a ton left to do. But I think what we are gonna do is take a quick break and then come back and finish the awards with a bang.   Okay.   Coming up a singular spectacular performance from Lady Gaga with Kenny Loggins Richard Simmons the cast of the hit movie Cats Sisqo Scarlett Johansson Beyonce with Destiny's Child Joaquin Phoenix as The Joker Steven Spielberg and Diddy all on one stage singing one song. And the first-ever Jaddy award. That is coming up. Stay with us.     Jad. Robert. Radiolab. Back to the awards.   Okay I would like to -- this is gonna be the -- the first-ever Jaddy.   Hmm.   I would like to award a Jaddy.   Okay.   To you Robert Krulwich. And I was trying to think what would my Jaddy be for? And I -- I was trying to isolate a moment a story a -- maybe like okay of the four tours that we have been on together maybe something from there. Lord knows there have been a million things that happened on those tours.   A lot of things.   Then I was thinking of all the like hundreds and hundreds of stories we did. Is there like a particular story mo -- memory and I could not really think of one. But then I thought of a -- I thought maybe the most appropriate thing is if I awarded a Jaddy to you to the first 20 minutes of every studio conversation we have ever had.   What does that mean?   It means when we sit down in these studio sessions?   Yeah.   As you know they go on for hours and hours sometimes if we are tracking a story or if we are interviewing somebody and sometimes these interviews are three or four together. So we are sitting in these seats for like four hours sometimes. But the first 20 minutes of -- of every time we sit down we just start ...   Oh they are just like -- they are pre- -- they are not radio parts. They are just making noises together parts.   Yeah. It is um -- I was thinking about -- and it drives -- I mean all -- it drives all the producers crazy except for Soren who has come to love it and understand it at this point because most of the time we are like Oh we got to get these things done but then you and I sit and we just banter for 20 minutes before we actually start working. And it is always this really important moment in not just my day but it is like this -- it is always these really important calibrating moments for me.   What do you mean?   Well it is like I walk into the studio with all of these problems in my head.   Right.   Problems with the stories I am trying to solve and the things I am trying to edit.   All the cobwebby things.   All the cobwebs and maybe there is somebody unhappy and there are meetings that I have not prepared for and it is all kind of in there. And then we sit down and then for 20 minutes we start to banter. And it is friendly banter but there is always like 15 minutes in or 18 minutes in there is a moment where I feel the shift in me and I discover that I was like oh this is really fun. You are -- like we have so much fun together. And I discover. It is almost like relearning being reborn every single time. Where the -- it is such a joy and a pleasure to do this with you. And you have always served that role for me where in the -- in those 20 minutes you remind me that to have delight and joy and -- and it is like you -- you know. It is like I am that way too but I forget.   Right.   And you have always served this role to remind me. You are the guy who reminds me.   Also I kind of noticed at a certain point that -- I noticed at a certain point that what was really making the show work for the audience was probably a little bit less what the subjects were because I am not sure there was a ravenous interest in you know physics and philosophy and all these things but when two people are having real fun.   Mm.   It is sort of like a warm fire or something. People just want to sort of sit next to it. And I -- I like that. I like that -- that this is true. Whatever else may be going on it is like trying to manufacture it. But this is true. Like we are really -- we are really engaged here. And there is something just nice about it.   Yeah. It is funny. 'True' is an interesting word too because I -- I think about -- like we often talk about play like we want to have -- it should be -- what we do is should be playful.   Yeah.   And the show has gotten darker over the years right?   Yeah.   And so it is become this -- this conversation we are always having which is like let us embrace that sense of play and joy and let us bring that back onto the air you know? So much of our early stuff was that and then we sort of started to tiptoe into other territories. But I -- I feel like what is been always been really inspiring is that you commit to the act of playing in a way that feels like it is actually deeply connected to truth in some way.   Yeah it might ...   If it ever feels dead it is not true in some way. And ...   Or at least -- at least one of the things about whatever it is you are staring at one of the things that you might want to go for is yes there might be something wrong that you need to know or something scary that you need to deal with or something that makes you angry that you need to -- that you need to confront but it seems to me that the thing that most people like to hear is they like to hear all those feelings translated into a kind of Oh no! And then into a small quiet grab of the hand. Like under the table. Like it is okay or we will do this together. And laughter is just such an enormously powerful part of that. Like ...   Yeah.   It asks you to stay and it gives you a little courage really.   Well yeah it is like sometimes people write it off as whimsy but I do not think it is that at all. I think it is actually much more. It is like being playful is so much more important than playing in some way.   Yeah and particularly if you are going to get very serious about something probably the hardest but most beautiful way to get serious about it is to giggle your way in. However it is not the normal way to do it but if you can you bring a much bigger group and you bring for some reason a little bit more attention. And key -- key is people stay a little bit longer.   Right. So I -- I was -- I would like to award you Bobby a Jaddy for all of those moments that you have actually fought like hell to protect the play. And it happens with me personally at the beginning of every interview. For 20 minutes we just kind of talk and we banter and I click back into that understanding every time. And then the studio happens and so I feel it is somehow -- it is a been an important part of my -- my journey with you is that you keep reminding me of that.   That is nice.   If I was -- if I had thought this out better I would have given you a statuette of some kind.   Uh-huh.   I was thinking maybe I -- it would be a statuette of like a Pied Piper or something.   Mm. No.   You know it is like you can ...   I am not leading you you come right -- you like ...   No I know I know. But it is like something like that. It is like a little ...   No a Jad -- a Jad should be -- a Jad should be ...   A Jaddy.   A Jaddy should be a somewhat humble if not actually ugly for -- see I feel Oscar is this sleek sort of golden thing. I do not even think it is a human. I do not know. I mean it is called by a human name but what is that? A Bobby is a wilting sort of sad old sad guy.   Have you ever given a statuette of a Bobby?   I have -- no I have drawn one. I have never -- there is no actual physical representatives of it no. It is too beautiful for -- for materiality. It just -- it cannot be made in the real world I do not think. The world would crack if Bobby actually got made. But Bobby in the imagination is a sort of kind of bald paunchy statue. So that is just Bobby. And I -- you know I think you should think of Jaddy in those -- in the same terms. Like Jad it should not be -- it should not be muscular sleek or -- it should be like something that is tired.   Tired.   And want to -- and wants to ...   He is just looking down at his shoes.   Looking down at his shoes.  Yes. That is right.   He is a shoegazer.   That is right. A shoegazing Jaddy.   So that is my Jaddy award.   Okay. Thank you. I am humbled.   So that is pretty much it. It is been really nice getting to look back on all this stuff with you.   Yeah it is been an interesting -- yeah it really -- this thing to do this for this long and to have you know think about all the things we have gotten to sort of get to think about. Like ...   Yeah.   That is mostly been self-assigned. Like you know a decade just looking up any old thing that just interested you.   Yeah.   And then getting to play with your mind like this. And then -- and maybe the most beautiful part is you know sometimes you get really irritated at the audiences because they are so stuck on what they know and expect and sometimes they can be a very conservative part of what you do. But then sometimes you meet them you know when you are walking around. And one of the coolest things -- because in television you are walking across the street and someone thinks Oh I know them from summer camp or from the elevator or something. I have seen them before. Or they know that you are on TV but they say Yo I saw you on TV and that is like a compliment I guess. But with Radiolab it is been Hi. Oh thank you for what you do. I do have an argument though about the thing you did about cell -- and I thought You remember that? And you have an opinion about it? And you want to keep that conversation going? For -- for someone who does this because you kind of want to expand -- you want to leave the universe in people's heads a little bit bigger than where you find them then to actually meet them and they say I am bigger. I listened to this thing and I am bigger.   Yeah.   And thank you.   That is a nice way to put it.   That is the nicest -- the nicest thing the nicest thank you that there is.   Yeah.   If you are trying to give yourself a crown I cannot think of a better one really. Called I listened and you made a difference to me. Thank you. Just -- just that sequence.   Mm-hmm.   That is -- yeah.   Yeah. Thank you my friend.   You are welcome.   You guys might want to sign off for the last time.   Okay. Oh yeah. Well it is not -- I mean let us be -- let us be -- let us just think about this for a second before we sign off. This is not gonna be the last time.   Well no it cannot be because we are ...   Because we are gonna be rerunning stuff. And so you are gonna be around.   Yeah.   And I take you at your word when you say that you will drop in we will do an adventure every so often.   Every so often. Why not? Yeah. Yeah because there'ill be something that occurs to me and I will just call you up and say What about blah bup bup? And then we will ...   And you know assuming it has nothing to do with snail sex I would say Sure that sounds great!   Maybe my first seven calls should be about snail sex.   Well I will just ...   No you might -- you should never take the position ...   I will just be getting my hair done those days.   You should never say never Jad. Even to snail sex.   Well all right. All right. For you Robert I will keep my mind open to the snail sex.   Never say never to snail sex.   But all this is to say it is not a goodbye.   No.   It is a see you around a little bit less.   That is right. That is right.   Except during reruns and except when you come and hang out.   That is right.   So all right.   Except breakfast and stuff.   Yeah. There is ...   But they are not coming to that.   There is that -- they do not get to hear that part.   No. Okay.   Okay. I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   Thank -- thank you Robert. And thank you all for listening.   Yeah.   Hey one more thing. Next week we actually have the beginning of something really special. We have a -- the first in a six-part series from our producer Latif Nasser. He is been working on this story he and Suzie Lechtenberg Executive Producer here have been reporting this story for three years. It is incredible.   With a very startling premise.   Yes!   And that is actually -- let me just say one last thing before I leave the room.   Please.   It is one of the pleasures of having done this is that like the people who have come here since you and I came here are bursting with experiments and ideas and the things they want to do are so sharp. And I just -- it is a source of enormous pride to me that in a way we have only just begun which I ...   Yeah. Well and it is also like you have imprinted on Latif I know that for sure.   I tried.   And me. And so we -- we -- you are in all of us at this point.   Okay. That is -- all right let us bring this to a halt.   Yes. Okay sorry! Okay. Well yeah so that is coming up next week six-part series. Until then thank you Robert.   You are welcome.   And thank you everybody for listening.    Copyright  2019 New York Public Radio.
