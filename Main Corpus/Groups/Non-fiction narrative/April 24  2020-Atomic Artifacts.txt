  Test test test test. Here we go. Hey everybody it is Jad. This is a time when a lot of us have been pushed into some really difficult circumstances. It is also a time that I think has clarified priorities about what is important. I have certainly been thinking a lot about this recently. Like who needs my support right now? There are the health and medical institutions that are on the frontlines. They definitely need that support. But there are also the cultural and art institutions that are struggling badly right now that I hope survive because they help me see outside my own head. We are able to deliver Radiolab to you because we have financial support from our listeners. We take that as a kind of sacred pact especially now. That in this moment we are gonna try and do our very best work for you. If you have the means join your fellow listeners in that support for yourself but also for the people right now who cannot. Your donation will ensure that we continue to bring you this podcast in the months to come continue to tell stories that help you see this moment for what it is but also hopefully help you see outside of it. Please visit Radiolab.org or text RL to the number 70101. That is RL to the number 70101. We will text you right back with a link where you can make an easy donation in support of the show. We hope you are healthy and safe and thank you for listening and for your support.     This is Radiolab. Im Jad Abumrad. This week we have sort of a continuation from the conversation we began last week but this story begins I guess you could say with a mystery.   Hi it is Garrett.   Hey Garrett. Simon here. How are ya?   I am well. Sorry I am running late today ...   And it comes from producer Simon Adler.   Yeah so this mystery all started just a couple years back when this guy ...   I am Garrett Graff. I am a historian journalist author et cetera et cetera.   ... was handed an ID badge.   So I was working at Washingtonian Magazine at the time and one of my colleagues found a government ID badge as he was commuting in one day.   Garrett says his colleague was just walking down the street when he saw on the ground this ID. And the colleague pretty immediately realized that this was not just any ID. It belonged to somebody with like a pretty high security clearance.   It -- you know he brought it into me and he goes Hey you cover this stuff. Like you can probably figure out how to get this badge back to this guy. So Im looking at the badge and trying to figure out you know sort of where this guy works and it is clear it is for someone who works in the intelligence community. And when I turned the badge over it had two sets of driving directions on the back. One labeled 'short-term' one labeled 'long-term.'   Driving directions on the back of the ID?   Yeah.   To where?   The short-term instructions obviously led to an office building in Arlington Virginia. But the long-term directions you know I did not know what they would lead to or sort of just how dramatic it would end up looking like.   So Garrett shuffled over to his computer.   I get on Google Maps Google Satellite and follow the directions.   You are just like clicking along?   That is absolutely what I was doing. Like sort of 'Turn left here.   Continue straight for ten miles keep right at the fork in the road.   Drive off down there.   Before long his satellite journey has taken him miles from Arlington.   Way out into Virginia getting more and more rural as Im dragging west.   Rolling hills turn into farmland then plains. And after several minutes of this and several hundred clicks Garrett finds himself in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.   And looking at the satellite you know I could tell that basically the road went sort of 100 or 200 yards further up and then disappeared into the side of the mountain.   Just dead-ends into the mountain.   Yeah.   Now whatever this road led to Garrett didnt know what it was.   It did not exist on the map that I was looking at.   But he had a pretty good hunch that whatever it was was inside the mountain itself.   You know I had covered national security in Washington for years and interviewed people who had been whisked to bunkers on 911 for instance.   Okay.   And so I assumed it was an evacuation facility that people would enter in the event of a surprise nuclear attack. And I was like you know wow! Like this whole world you know exists out here. And we just have no idea.   And Garrett just thought Ive gotta know more about this.   Exactly.  And so that launched me on this quest to understand the history of the U.S. government's doomsday planning.   And eventually this quest would lead him -- and consequently us -- to a pretty existential question about America. In fact building on what we did last week what he came across was a sort of cataclysm sentence for the United States. And it emerged in a moment when -- when the nation was gripped fiercely by this sense that the end was near I mean even more fiercely than the moment we are living through right now 1950s Cold War America.   One of the things that is hard for us to remember now because were looking at history as sort of where the Cold War ended which is you know tens of thousands of nuclear warheads that could bring global annihilation in 17 minutes was that for much of the 1950s there was a real belief that you know the U.S. might actually be hit by 50 or 60 atomic bombs.   Which would essentially be like 50 or 60 Hiroshimas happening around the country.   Yes. And you know if you are looking at a Hiroshima-sized bomb that explodes in Times Square for instance if you are in New Jersey or Brooklyn you have not had a great day ...      ... but you have likely survived if you were in the basement or you were in the center of a building. You might be injured for sure but ...   Youre not gonna be vaporized in a moment.   You wouldnt necessarily be vaporized in a moment.   And given the relatively low number of these bombs ...   Dozens of bombs not tens of thousands.   Even in the worst-case scenario a sort of all-out strike from the Soviet Union ...   You know most of the country would be untouched by the explosions from that. There would be fallout and radiation that would spread beyond but nuclear war was thought to be a relatively survivable phenomenon. And so there was this whole elaborate process across the U.S. government of really imagining what post-nuclear war America looked like.   So just to play this out step by step imagine ...     It is 1960 youre living in Austin listening to the radio when out of nowhere ...     And so you run down into the nearest fallout shelter as Austin and a number of other major U.S. cities are decimated. And you hunker down until finally several weeks later ...     And as you crawl out of your shelter and look around you just see destruction. You dont recognize Austin you dont recognize America. Your house? Destroyed. Your friends and neighbors? Missing. You have no food no car. You have no idea what to do where to go. Youre terrified. But fortunately for you ...   Every aspect of the U.S. government had effectively this secret shadow post-apocalypse version of itself.   This is one of the first things Garrett discovered when he started digging into this that the government had a very detailed plan for what to do.   So as a couple of examples the National Park Service would run refugee camps because the belief was national parkland would not be targeted by nuclear war. And so you know parks like Yosemite would become these camps.   Like did they have a specific portion of Yellowstone that they were like Oh weve got some nice flat land here. This will be the place well put up the tents?   Yes. I mean the planning was done to the level of which roads people would enter where they would park.   Hmm.   Another agency the U.S. Post Office would actually be the agency that was in charge of registering the dead and figuring out who was still alive because the Post Office best understood where people lived.   So lets say you made it to one of these National Parks-turned-refugee camps after the attack.   When you arrived you would be given one of these pre-printed postcards and they were just normal postcard size.   Beige color almost like manila folder. And they were known as POD Form 810s. And those exist. I have one. I bought one on eBay for three dollars.      And looking at one of these on the back side it reads I amwe are safe and can be reached at this address. And then it has some blank lines where you are meant to fill in the quote Members of family included in this notification.   And you would fill out who survived in your party. And then beyond the Post Office the U.S. Department of Agriculture was in charge of figuring out how to feed America after nuclear war. And so they spent an inordinate amount of time figuring out sort of what the most survivable food could be. And they ended up amassing what they called survival crackers manufactured in enormous quantity by companies like Nabisco.             In fact on YouTube you can find this genre of video where people go into old abandoned buildings or mine shafts ...           ... places that used to have fallout shelters. And they unearth boxes and boxes and boxes of these things.       And they were sort of a particularly unpleasant graham cracker.   Like very fibrous it had a lot of nutrition?   Yep.     And of course you can also find videos of people eating them.         And I have actually eaten one. In my U.S. History class freshman year of high school apparently the teacher had dug out the bin of biscuits from the schools fallout shelter before they could be thrown out and any student who wanted to could come and eat one.   You had a fallout shelter in your high school?   Yeah I bet you did too.   Under -- did I?   Yeah I bet you did.   Wow!   I mean throughout the '60s the Office of Civil Defense went around retrofitting and stocking basically any building that they could get their hands on. And part of that part of turning these buildings into fallout shelters was shipping out these crackers. I mean in total ...   The government hid something like 160 million tons of these crackers.   Which to put in perspective is about 200 Golden Gate Bridges worth of these things. Anyhow moving on ...   You know the IRS ran calculations of how they would levy taxes and the Federal Reserve built a mountain bunker you know with 2 billion cash hidden inside of it.   2 billion?   Yes. Think of it as you know the nation's bank of last resort.   Okay.   Now what made that 2 billion sort of particularly amusing was the U.S. found that most Americans had no interest whatsoever in 2 bills. But rather than pulp the unused unwanted bills figuring that after nuclear war people would be much less choosy what the Federal Reserve did was they actually shrink-wrapped the 2 bills and hid them inside the bunker.   Oh my God!   So if you or I went to take out a loan in this post-apocalyptic world we would be walking out with a stack of 2 bills.   That is amazing!   Like what -- what percentage of people working for the federal government would actually be saved to run all these things?   Yeah. So the short answer is very few in the grand scheme of things.   Mm-hmm. I would presume.   You know in round numbers probably about 10000 government officials in Washington would be saved. And this actually gets to the heart of doomsday planning which is the goal is not for any single American to survive nuclear war. The goal is for America to survive nuclear war. And like America is an idea.   Which is arguably true of every country but here ...   We do not have you know a hereditary monarch that has been handed down through hundreds of years in a single unbreakable fashion.   Mm-hmm.  What we have are these institutions ...     And sort of these historical totems ...     ... that have bound us together generation by generation. And so if you are trying to preserve America if you want to say that the America of the apocalypse is the America of before you need these historical totems you need these quasi-religious artifacts from our past.   Objects that capture the idea of America that could be passed on to the folks who survived a nuclear attack so that they could rebuild it. But the thing is they only had essentially one helicopter set aside to save stuff. The rest were reserved for saving people.   And so there was a large task force that came up with this list of artifacts that needed to be saved.   Now unfortunately we dont really know how they came to their decisions. That information is apparently either lost to history or is still classified. But we do know some of the items that they vetoed.   You know the oil portraits of the former joint chiefs from the Pentagon and a number of animal skeletons.  And we also know of seven items that they landed on that they decided needed to be saved. So the sort of Group A Items -- there were three of them -- consisted of maybe unsurprisingly the Charters of Freedom.   Okay.   So the Declaration of Independence the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.   Okay. So the Bill of Rights the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution. Those feel like easy. That is low-hanging fruit.   Yeah that is easy. But then we get to the sort of Group B Items which -- which get a little strange. There are four of them that we know of. So number one was a log from the USS Monitor.   The -- the log of the USS Monitor?   Yes. Which was a Civil War-era battleship that the Union had and which was eventually sunk.   So this is like an 1850s to '60s ship that was sunk?   Yes.   Huh. Was that -- did -- do you have any -- why -- why?   So this is my speculation. But I think it is that the -- when the USS Monitor was built it was one of these early -- what are they called like clad-iron battleships? It was -- it was a demonstration of American ingenuity in wartime. It was out -- it was us showing that we can innovate in the name of protecting our country and destroying our enemies.   Is there anything in the -- that it was a Civil War-era ship? That this is a moment that America was being torn apart and ...   Could be. Yep. That we fought battles before and managed to piece ourselves back together.   It is also a symbol of sacrifice that we sacrificed for -- for the preservation of the Union.   It is also possible that somebody who was on the committee was just like a big fan of the USS Monitor and was like Come on guys we gotta save the log.   Hmm.   Okay. So that is number one.   That is number one. And that was agreed to.   That was agreed to.   Of all things America that needs to be passed forward is this log.   Yeah.   Okay.   Number two Lincolns medical records post-assassination.   What?   And the logic there I again am presuming is that it is very likely that the U.S. president will have been killed in the early moments of this nuclear exchange. And so to have the -- the medical records of Lincoln and be able to say We have lost a President before. We have lost a heroic President before ...   Yeah.   ... and we have managed to pull ourselves back together that seems to be the symbolic significance of those medical records.   I see. Interesting.   Again I am no historian. This is me thinking about why the hell would they do this?   Right right right. Okay so those are the first two.   Thats one and two. Number three is the signed surrender documents from the Japanese at the end of World War II.   Thats a great victory.   Great victory.   So these are -- these are so far totems to great losses and great resilience.   Well said.   All right.   And then the final one breaks that mold slightly. It is a painting capturing the journey that Lewis and Clark made westward in 1806.   Oh so it is about uncharted territories it is also about conquest.   Mm-hmm.   It is also about the land.   Mm-hmm.   Interesting. Okay. Those are the four.   Those are the four we know of.   That seems so narrow to their point of view. I mean why wouldnt you put the Dred Scott Decision? You could put Ida B. Wells reporting on lynchings. Like those are things that I feel like should be put into the helicopter. So I -- I wanna argue with this list. But where do you --- where do you wanna do with this list more -- more importantly?   I have several questions. Number one is America in 2020 what the hell are the appropriate objects at this point?   Thats where my mind wants to go. In this moment of profound change its such a hard question to answer right now.   Very complicated.   And so I feel like what you should do is -- and you need to crowd-source this shit Simon. Like I do not know. Like oh my God that would create some fights.   Oh so many! So many. Maybe we should just stay with the USS Monitor log and avoid all the conflict.    I do not think that would fly.   No. So folks when we come back from break we head out across this great nation of ours to ask today in the year 2020 can we agree upon a list of items that more fully represents what America was what America is and what America could be? Thats when we come back from break.   This is Radiolab Im Jad Abumrad Here with Simon Adler.   Yes yes yes.   And okay Simon let us do it.   Okay well so as I told you before the break we came across this list of objects our Cold War-era government planned to save to rally America after an atomic attack.   Remind me ...   So it is this log from the US ...   Oh yeah yeah. Sorry you were about to do that.   A log from the USS Monitor.   Mm-hmm.   Abraham Lincolns medical records post-assassination the signed Japanese surrender documents and then a map of Lewis and Clarks journey west.   Right. Right. All weighty objects but a bit musty.   Right. And so the thought was lets go out and ask Americans people other than the cigarette-smoking pocket protector-wearing bureaucrats of the 1950s what they would want added to this list.   Check check.   And is your sense that youre going to find the one thing that we all agree on or ...?   I think the exercise itself is sort of foolish. To convince oneself that youre gonna get down to one item is just completely insane. So no this was just me setting out to try to get some new answers. It is by no means comprehensive or in any way scientific it was just sort of a coronavirus interrupted attempt to kick off a conversation.   All right. Walking down Canal Street here on Sunday February 16.   And for my first stop ...   Hello hello. Wow busy spot this Sunday! Im Simon. Very nice to meet you. How are you?   I wanted to go to a variety of American Legion halls.   Thats where -- a sort of a vets' association?   Yep. Its like a social club for veterans.   The American Legion is a national organization. Right now it is close to two million members.   This is Gabe.   My name is Gabe Muy. I was drafted into the army during the Vietnam era.   I spoke to him at the Chinatown American legion Post 1291 which is actually the largest in the city.   Really?   Yeah. Wouldnt have guessed it. And we also swung down to Post 1544 on Staten Island.   This is an interesting choice. What did you hear?   Their answers were -- were very patriotic and stayed pretty close to that original list.   I would say the original written U.S. Constitution.   Definitely take the Constitution because that would put you on the right path.   I think the Armistice from World War I and the signing of the World War II declaration of surrender because it shows that history repeats itself.   And the other answers we got were a little bit narrow.   I would love to see the first convention pin of the American Legion in 1919 kept.   Huh. Okay thats interesting-ish.   So from there I thought like lets go to people that think about items a lot Curators at museums. So lets call up some niche little museums around the country. But ...     Unfortunately many of them had already closed.     Because of the coronavirus.       And didnt get back to me.     But who did get back to me was ...   Let me plug you into the headset here. Just a moment.   Andrew Beckman from the Studebaker Museum in South Bend Indiana.   You still there?   I am here yep.   And he archives what is left of the Studebaker Corporation. They made horse-drawn equipment then cars and for his item ...   You know of course to rally American spirit afterward either the Star Spangled Banner the actual flag that flew over Fort Sumpter or one of the Iwo Jima flags.   Yeah.   Yeah. Not like the sexiest thing but it did come up more than once.   Oh yes. I agree.   This is Carrie McCoy and she and her company ...   FlagAndBanner.com.   ... know a thing or two about flags. They sell one of if not the widest selection of them in America. And she said just look at when people go out and buy them.   Flags are just kind of like church. When things are bad people start going to church. When things are bad flag sales will be soaring.   But then as I broadened out further they started to get more interesting more particular.   Images of the physical beauty of the United States like Edward Weston and Ansel Adams.   Like these from Alexis Rossi of the Internet Archive and history professor Greg Smoak.   Perhaps instead of the Lewis and Clark map the Fort Laramie Treaty Council map.   We got one that was maybe a little too particular.   This is a bit on the esoteric side.   From NYU professor Beth Simone Noveck.   I would add the Administrative Procedure Act.   What does that do?   Its boring. But its this right that we have that almost nobody knows about.   Thanks to it we get to inform what regulations federal agencies make.   I see. All right.   And then we also got some suggestions like this one from truck driver Buck Ballard ...   The AA book called Alcoholics Anonymous that we just call the big book.   That were I do not know cleverly obtuse.   Because in that is the key to recovery from pretty much anything. Just scribble out alcohol and write in crystal meth.   Or a nuclear attack.   Whatever the case may be.      And then I came to what I think is my favorite answer from Sharony Green.   You know and its funny because Im a woman of color. I totally get the Kaepernick thing. Trust me. Get it. Get it! Get it get it get it! But Im also like proud to be American because were just so quirky.   Shes a Professor of History at the University of Alabama.   Roll Tide.   Roll Tide.   And she suggested a concert recording.   So the Newport Jazz Festival 1958. You have all of these people in this picturesque setting listening to jazz. These days it is highbrow more often than not but what keeps this particular concert earthy is Mahalia Jackson. Just the sacredness of this song The Lord's Prayer takes you to a more solemn space. It just touches you. I mean it would make us stop and realize theres something bigger.  Something bigger. Something bigger has a bit more power than we do. And there is some beauty in that that Americans as arrogant as we are realize our limitations just for a second.   Yeah.   And then Sharony went on to say there was actually one more reason in fact the reason why she picked this specific live recording.   It is the audience that I am actually thinking of. If you look in the audience you are gonna see people black and white male and female sitting there together. Its the beginnings of shared space.   I dont mean to buck the storyline youre going with here but like I dont get it.   But then I ran into several people who -- who thought that this exercise was one of the dumber things I could spend my time doing.   I swear to God and I do not mean this the wrong way but like ...   And the sort of chief among them being New Yorker writer Jill Lepore.   ... the question after the apocalypse is not Do we have Abraham Lincoln's medical records? The question is Who are we that we did this to each other?   Okay but isnt the push back something like dont you need some of these totems to rally people and to tell them that hey were still here?   So what we need after the apocalypse is nationalism?   If not -- if not a national identity that you are gonna have people rally behind what ...   It would have been the national identity that brought the apocalypse in the first place. Like what we want to preserve our totems of what it was that drove us like that is -- that is bananas Simon. Like it is bananas.   Okay. Well so then let me pose the question this way If we are trying to answer the question of who are we that we did this to each other are there any artifacts are there any objects that you think would help us answer that question and then move forward from it?   Like I think I understand where you and I are parting ways. In your supposition in the aftermath of an atomic war what would endure would be the nation-state. It would not. I mean the nation-state was devised to grant rights to human beings under a written constitution. If under that system of organization we actually kill one another then the nation-state would not deserve to endure.   Growing is about exploring. And if you are not able to explore fluidly then you are not gonna be able to grow.   And then the second of this one-two punch came from Communications Manager and oft-times host of KILI Radio.   You are listening to Voice of The Lakota Nation across the Pine Ridge Reservation on 90.1 FM.   Arlo Iron Cloud.   Oh man Ive been on KILI radio for about 19 years now. Almost two decades. Its crazy.   KILI is a community radio station serving the Pine Ridge Reservation.   The Pine Ridge Reservation is about 45000 people roughly the size of Rhode Island smack dab in the southwestern corner of South Dakota. And so you know what it is like these days? Man we are redefining ourselves in this day and age after all the atrocities that have happened to our people in the past.   And what struck me with him was an atomic bomb descending upon civilization is essentially what happened to the Lakota Sioux Tribe as well as the rest of the native Americans in this country.   Its happened to our people in the past. Big time. And so I often think about what would happen if something happened so drastic that we would have to leave.   And when his mind goes there ...   There is just so much stuff that I would love to take with me. Bows earrings quill bags teepees the sacred pipe. This pipe goes back 27 generations.   27 generations! What even is that like 800 years?   Yeah. We have that. And we -- there is a great story behind that Simon. And I am teaching my children that and I do not think it would be very wise of me to like tell these stories on national radio but that pipe it represents us.   But even this even this pipe ...   I do not even know -- I do not know if we would actually take it.   And why?   Because he says if you look at the history of the Oglala Lakota tribe ...   You know we do not have anything written down. Our forefathers did not write anything down and that is probably the best thing for us.   Because he says when he looks to the broader United States ...   The United States of America the people that belong to it sometimes I think they take the things that were written by your forefathers too literally and they cannot adapt it into the future.   Take for example the Bill of Rights he says. Because it was written down it is rigid. Whereas a Lakota story even one that is even 27 generations old Arlo can take that and adapt it to the present moment.   And that is what we are doing. We are adapting everything that we know and we are moving forward into the future.   And so given the choice he says the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence ...   Oh I am kind of an anarchist in that I would burn them. I would let them go to dust. I know at the -- I probably -- it probably hurts to hear -- hear that but I -- I think it would be kind of cool.   Huh. Here we are. This is the kind of American thing of the moment which is do we preserve the thing or do we burn it down? Where do you -- where do you land in all of this?   I do not even know Jad. I do not -- I am still sort of lost as to what to take away from this other than even though this is a story that I pitched and a story that I went out to report I was sort of skeptical of it from the get-go in that ...    I love that. Okay.   Yeah in that like I am skeptical or I do not -- I sort of bristle when I hear questions about what is the mood of America what is the conversation America is having right now? These grand national questions about who we are. And I think the reason I -- I bristle or I chafe at that is I remember as a kid growing up in Wisconsin watching the news or listening to the news at the end of day and hearing reporters talk about what was going on in America and just not relating to it or not seeing any of it on the ground at all. And I came to believe that either the news was exaggerating everything or they just were not talking about me or anyone I had ever met.   Hmm.   And so there is -- there is an arrogance in thinking you can take the nation's temperature. However here I -- I just spent the last two months doing this and I think it is because despite everything I just said secretly deep down I wanted to find something that we could all agree on even now. And Ill say there was one thing that that kept coming up.   You know -- you know I mean what would tell our story?   And I do not think it was ever anyone's first choice but ...   Oh maybe you should put -- I know what it is. Oh yeah. An image from the moon looking at Earth.   Almost everyone said they would want to preserve something from the Apollo moon missions.   I like it. That is what I would put.   President Kennedy Navy lieutenant in World War II where he said      Were gonna put a man on the moon.     You know the speech that Kennedy gave ...   John F. Kennedy putting a man in the moon.     The earthrise photo of Apollo 8.     The Apollo 11 space capsule.   The actual like recordings of the audio ...     ... from the Apollo 13 mission.     And everyone had their own reason as to why.   To help people remember the ways we as a nation have come together to survive something that doesnt seem survivable.   Cause nobody may ever get there again.   Its the greatest industrialization our country ever saw.   Talk about display of prowess the ability to -- to engineer resources.   It is something that America did collaboratively.   It is like people are still yearning for that sense of like unity and transcendence.   And a project.   Yeah. A common mission a common purpose.   But I think what I actually like most about it is America did this at a time when we were more polarized potentially than we even are right now. Like America was going through far more radical changes than I think we face today. And yet out of that maelstrom we did this transcendent thing.   Yeah.   And so what this leaves me with is the feeling that I want to live in a time and a place in an iteration of America where we achieve something that inspiring. And I think maybe that is actually what we all want.   Producer Simon Adler. This episode was reported and produced by Simon with editing from Pat Walters and reporting assistance from Tad Davis.
