DOLLY PARTON'S AMERICA -     You are dealing with somebody right now.   Who is barely almost dead?   Yeah.   Mentally?   Slow brain power.   Okay.   I am like half the man that you know.      Which is already pretty piss poor.   Well I could just -- maybe I could just say now for -- yeah I will start. Maybe let me try something and see what happens.   Yeah.   Okay.   Okay. I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab. And what we are about to do is something we have never done before. Actually Jad did it. It is about a lady.   Yes.   And about a nation and about everybody listening.   Yeah.   All at once. And I really can think of no other way to do this except to say to say.   I -- you know what? I thought that was actually much better than I have come up with in the two years I have been working on this project.   Okay.   Yeah you just summarized it perfectly. For the last two and a half years I have been creating a side project that is gonna be on a separate feed DollyPartonsAmerica.com is where you can sign up for it.   Dolly Parton's America.   Kind of gives it away does not it?   Well it is not about Barbra Streisand.   No that is true.   Okay.   But I have created a nine-part series about Dolly Parton and we are gonna preview the first episode right now. Here.   Mm-hmm. And if you want to hear the other ones where do you go?   You go to DollyPartonsAmerica.com or you go to Apple Podcasts and you search on that Dolly Parton's America. Or all the other places.   Okay but to decide whether you want to do that or not first listen to the first one.   Yeah. This is the first one.   Which is coming at you now.   What is Dolly Partons America?   Well Dolly Partons America would be the same as Dolly Partons world.  Hey Im Jad Abumrad. Let me explain how I got here to a podcast about Dolly Parton. I grew up in Tennessee which means I grew up in ...   Dolly Partons world.   Dollys world. She was everywhere. She was looking down at you from billboards coming out of car radios. She was on commercials. She just infused the air. So as a consequence I didnt really think about her a lot. Its a little bit like that joke one fish says to another fish Hows the water today? And the other fish says Whats water? I was that second fish. Shed created this world and I was just swimming through it. But then a few things happened. 2016. Im living in New York. Dolly is on tour. And she comes and does a stadium show here in Flushing Queens. And just the level of excitement of people around me was like other-worldly. Everybody around me was like ...   Dolly Parton is a goddess.   Shes a saint.   To me Dolly is a superstar who brings herself to the level of the people.   I was like Whoa I -- I missed this.   So I was sitting in my home office I was on Twitter and ...   Writer Sarah Smarsh told me that her Whoa moment came around the same time when she was in Austin online watching people live tweet that same Dolly show.   The people who were tweeting were all women. And one woman in particular she said That majestic bitch just started playing a goddamn pan flute.    That is the best tweet.   Pan flute was in all caps which seemed important.   And all this was happening the pan flute the tweeting the touring at exactly the moment when the 2016 election was turning very ugly.       Like she tore right through all of that noise. Through the general election and beyond. And I kept bumping into people who would describe the experience of being at a Dolly show as like standing in an alternate vision of America than what was unfolding on the TV.   I remember just standing out in the lobby and just people watching because it was the most diverse place Ive ever been. I was seeing a multi-racial audience. People wearing cowboy hats and boots. I was seeing people in drag. Church ladies. Lesbians holding hands. Little girls who were there with their families.   You had a whole audience of people who absolutely their philosophies were in opposition to each other co-mingling and everybody is polite to each other.   So that was one thing that caught my attention. That in this very divided moment Dolly seems to maybe be a kind of unifier. And after doing a little poking around the data does kind of bear this out. If you look at her global Q Score this is a measure of how well people think about your brand globally. What they do is they assemble a very diverse sample of people they ask them a bunch of questions and out of all of these different brands that are out there all these different performers she is in the top 10 globally in terms of everybody's favorites. But she is almost number one when it comes to lack of negatives if that makes any sense. Like people have the least amount of negative things to say about Dolly Parton than anyone besides maybe Adele. And by the way this Q Score data is fascinating. I have not dug into it too much so I cannot claim to fully understand it but Beyonc? Number 52. What? Lady Gaga number 41. It is wild. Anyhow the second thing that happened that made this series possible I will be honest with you guys was a strange twist of fate.     2013 Dolly Parton gets into a minor car accident ends up at Vanderbilt Hospital. And one of the people who ends up giving her medical advice is my dad. And they became friends. She shared this with me by the way and was totally fine with me sharing it. But it was very unexpected. Like my dad is not a doctor-to-the-stars kind of person. Hes just a Lebanese guy in Tennessee. But they were friends suddenly. And so when I started getting curious about Dolly as maybe the subject of a story I was like You know what Dad? I need you to introduce me.   And he did. I sat down to talk with her to ask her about this Dolly moment how she thinks about it. Does she consider herself the grand unifier? Does that include everyone? With all these questions I thought maybe I would get a story out of it or two. But what ended up happening is in simply talking with her about her life and then talking with people about her I fell into so many different rabbit holes. Profound questions of America kind of rabbit holes. And I was like You know what? I think we gotta make nine. We are gonna take nine trips into the Dollyverse. This is Dolly Parton's America. I am Jad Abumrad. Let us start!   I first spoke to Dolly Parton in November of 2017.   My chair's squeaking.   Thats the squeaky one. Right.   Oh I know the squeaky chair gets the grease but we do not have time for a lube job today. We got a show to do.   We sat down in a studio in Nashville in a squeaky chair in front of a mic that unfortunately had a little bit of a buzz in it. Dolly had just come off of her Pure And Simple Tour.     That was the tour where she famously played the pan flute.   Oh yeah. Just for show. I am not great at any of it but I can -- I can make a good show. Better take off the jewels before I mess up a good take.   I had heard you play 20-something instruments. Is that right?   Well I play at 'em.  I dont play any of them well. The guitar is my best one. But I play a lot of mountain instruments too. Dulcimer autoharp banjo that kind of stuff.   And you play wind too. You play ...   Well that is the penny whistle. We do a little bit of an Appalachian thing just we -- a little woodwind but not -- it is just the mountain sounds just not like something you would learn or play in an orchestra. It is just got that old mountain sound.   Gotcha.   Anyhow ...   Well you know me. You just ask and Ill just tell it as I know it or as I feel it. What I want you to hear.    So I decided to start the interview by playing her some stuff of hers.   I would love to play some of your early stuff.   Okay.   This one just tell me what comes to mind when you hear it.     Wow!      What is that first line?   Oh Being born was the worst mistake I ever made. The doctor did not spank me he just slapped me in the face.  Well as a writer you want to come up -- you want to come up with the really good lines if youre a really good songwriter.   Where does that come from?   That was really really early on in those early early days. Oh I used to write a lot of sad ass songs.   Let me explain the reason I wanted to start with the sad ass songs. Growing up in the early '80s I -- I mean one of my main associations with Dolly before this project was that she was sort of a punchline. Or like she was her own punchline. You know like I remember she would go on Leno or Letterman.     Theyd talk about her weight for a little while then they would talk about how she looks. And then inevitably ...       They would start talking about her breasts.     They would joke about her breasts. But then she would make an even better joke about her breasts.     Here's another example.     Yes. The first cloned sheep was known as Dolly the sheep.   This is Helen Morales author of the book Pilgrimage to Dollywood.   Scientists managed to clone a cell.     Well and that cell was from a mammary gland. So these men thought it would be a good idea ...     To call it Dolly.     But the sting in that story is -- and characteristically Dolly Parton is that when she heard about this she invited the sheep when it had served its scientific purpose to come and live at Dollywood.   So when you go on these shows and they make a joke about you and you double the joke what is that?      Part of me thinks -- part of me loves that but part of me thinks Why would not you just tell these people like 'Come on. I have written 5000 songs. Ask me about my songs.' So I -- I dont know. I have two thoughts at once.   Well why would I go out with my tits hanging out showing 'em pushing 'em out there and not expect somebody to make some kind of a comment on it? And I know what they are thinking. So I would rather say it before they do. And then we get that off our chest so to speak right up front.   That is a good pun by the way.   Yeah I know. I have said it before.  But I really do -- like I just think Well you know I mean this is how I look. Of course you are gonna notice it.   Yeah.   See I do that too for the public. I mean it is like a little comedy thing.   In that last sentence by the way Dolly was actually referencing something she would once told Barbara Walters like years ago.         So yeah growing up -- and I think I speak for many people of my generation when i say this at least many men Dolly Parton was seen as this kind of joke maker. This cloud of jokes always swirling around her. You know jokes people would make about her that she would make about herself maybe on the public. I dont know. But her persona was so big that often it was the only thing that got noticed. But then Ill be honest. One of the first bits of guidance that we got as we were embarking on this series -- and by 'we' I mean myself and producer Shima Oliaee is Shima was talking with writer Helen Morales who you heard earlier. Helen was basically telling Shima Look. You can talk about the persona and the jokes ...   But -- but it would be a pity if somewhere in your series there wasnt something about her songwriting. The only other thing I would say is treat her lyrics seriously in a way that Johnny Cash has had books written about his lyrics Hank Williams has been taken seriously but Dolly Parton hasnt.   Which brings us back to ...   Well I used to write a lot of sad ass songs.   That is what was really surprising. There is some darkness in those early songs.   Well you -- as a songwriter and so you gotta remember too that is how I grew up.   Now hardcore Dolly fans will know this but Dollys discography goes back all the way to 1967. And the songs on those first four albums its an ocean of pain.   Those songs which are -- which many people do not know about. They are not the ones that have made the charts. They provide an insistent witnessing of women's lives.   Thats how Helen Morales puts it.   Women being treated really badly by men.   Let me just play you another one.       Do you remember this one?   That was Daddy Come And Get Me. That was actually a song I wrote that was based on something that really happened in our family.   Really?   Mm-hmm.     I had an aunt. Loved this man. And he just drove her crazy.     What did he do?   Cheating and all that. put her in an insane -- well I cant say who.   No no. I dont -- I dont need to know who but ...   I thought you said who!  I cant call names! But it was a relative. And she would beg her -- her -- she was begging her daddy trying to get a message to her daddy to come and get her out of the insane asylum.   Wait. So she ...   That her husband had put her in there.   Wait. So he was cheating on her. And then what happened?   Well she had a nervous breakdown. So he just called and had her put away.   This is something by the way that if you Google it you will fall down a rabbit hole. Well into the 20th century this was a common thing. Husbands would commit their wives for things like quote Nagging excitement disagreeing with their husbands religious beliefs.   So he wanted her out of his life. So that is -- I grew up with that. And I was very impressionable.   Another theme that is impossible to miss from Dollys sad ass song period is -- well this next song basically captures it.     This is a song that she wrote in 1967 called The Bridge.     It tells the story of a woman falling in love with a man. They have their first kiss under the full moon on a bridge. He gets her pregnant. Then he bolts. And months later as shes pregnant she returns to that bridge.     Damn that ending.      A couple of your songs in this period deal with suicide. Is that something that you thought about ever?   Years ago. I do not think I got to that place but I -- I understood exactly how people do. I was -- this was back in the -- oh I do not know many years ago. Early '80s I think I was.   She was in her late-30s at this point. She would just done a movie which caused her a ton of stress. And she was having health problems.   I was -- I got overweight. And I was going through the change of life. I was having a lot of female problems. I had been going through a whole lot of family things just the stress with a heartache. And there was just several things going on at that time. And I was just broken down. You know I really was having some serious conversations with God during that time.   What were those conversations?   Well I just said things like Look this is just ridiculous. I am not happy. Arguing about what -- you know why we cannot -- when they say you should not commit suicide because that is a sin you cannot get forgiven for but then it was this all -- everything was just confusing to me. And I was just angry and I was hurt and I was unhappy. And so I just said You are gonna have to give me some answers or I am getting out of here. And then we will both deal with it.   How close did you get when you ...?   I do not know. I do not know how close I got.   She says there was a moment sort of at the low point when she was sitting on her bed. And her dog jumped up on the bed. It felt to her like a sign.   My little dog Popeye at that time he jumped up on the bed about the time I was writing my you know -- so God G-O-D. D-O-G G-O-D. Dog. God spelled backwards. So I always thought you know that might have been the very thing that kind of ...   You were writing your suicide note? Or ...   I was thinking about it.   Wow. You said heartache. I mean was it -- what was the heartache?   Well it was personal.   Fair enough.   We started talking about how a lot of her early songs are about women losing children.   I never lost a baby. Ive never been pregnant in my life. But Ive seen a lot of people that have and have had to go through that. Ive seen it. I have seen the -- you know like I always say there is two kind of women in the mountains the kind that get married and have a lot of kids and the kind that stay single and have a lot of kids.  But I would also write things about peoples lives and topics that I knew that mattered. I was writing about abortion I was writing about adoption. I was writing about all sorts of things back before it was -- when I even wrote a song called Down From Dover. About a girl that got pregnant and got sent away from home because she was pregnant because they wouldnt accept it.       This song is written from the perspective of a young teenager who is pregnant trying to conceal it and waiting for her man to return.     If he comes back in time she basically wont be shamed by her community. But of course ...     He does not. She is ostracized from her family.   And then the baby's born.     And the baby died.   Stillborn.     And so she felt like that God had done her a favor. God had taken the baby back. In my mind the baby was better off back with God than it would have been with me. And they wouldnt play it on the radio back at that time. Its one of my best songs ever.   They wouldnt play it on the radio because of the con ...   They wouldnt play it on the radio not because the kid died but because she got pregnant. Because she -- it was an illegitimate. At that time see that was -- when I first wrote that that was in my early days of my career and I wanted to put it out as a single and RCA wouldnt do it.   Keep in mind this song was written five years before Roe V. Wade. But I suggested to Dolly that maybe one of the reasons RCA did not want to put it out is that it is just too dark?   Well you -- as a songwriter and so you gotta remember too thats how I grew up. All those old mountain songs and all those old songs from the old world. All those old English Irish Scottish Welsh ballads about the Knoxville girl getting killed and throwed in the Knoxville River. And I was very you know impressionable.   Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me just take a digression here because that song that Dolly just mentioned sent me down another rabbit hole. In the interview I did not catch it when she said ...   The Knoxville girl getting killed and throwed in the Knoxville River.   But listening back I was like Wait what? A Knoxville girl thrown in a river? It turns out this is a very old Appalachian ballad that is sung from the perspective of a man who goes to meet his young wife or girlfriend I guess. And they are taking a walk along river. And then all of a sudden ...     Picks up a stick. Beats her ...     She begs for mercy. This is in the song. She begs for mercy but he keeps beating her with the stick until she is unconscious and then ...     Drags her by her hair.     And then he throws her in the river. And I was like Wait. This is what she was talking about?   I grew up with that.   What is this twisted song? Who is the girl? Why does the guy murder her? So I ended up calling this journalist.   Hello?   Can I speak to Paul please?   You are doing so. Hi Jad.   His name is Paul Slade. Hes a music writer based in London. And he recently wrote a book all about this.   Called Unprepared To Die which looks at the real murder stories behind Knoxville Girl and a range of other American murder ballads.   First thing he told me is that there are tons of these songs.     So many. Always about a man ...     ... killing a woman often his wife by shooting her or ...     ... drowning her. Thats a big one. But with the Knoxville girl song what Paul did was he traced it back from East Tennessee where Dolly would have heard it back to England.   The first version of the song I have seen was 1685 or thereabouts. We cannot be precisely sure about that.   The song was originally called The Bloody Miller.   So I went looking for surviving copies of The Bloody Miller's ballad sheet.   Now obviously there are no original recordings of this song but he did manage to find a copy of the sheet music from the original printing 330-ish years ago. And at the top of that sheet music there was like a little intro.   And it says this. A true and just account of one Francis Cooper of Hogstow near Shrewsbury ...   Whoa.   ... who kept company with one Anne Nichols for the space of two years. And being urged by her father to marry her he most wickedly and barbarously murdered her.   Oh wow. So it lays it all out right there.   Well yeah. We have got the name of the killer his victim and we have got a location which is Shrewsbury.   Paul goes to Shrewsbury digs around in the archives finds a copy of a diary from a shoekeeper at the time. Confirms that yes there was a murder that happened right at the time that the song was written. He visits the grave of the murder victim confirms that yes she was a real person. He checks the burial records to confirm that yes her death was actually very violent. And it was the age-old story. The woman Anne Nichols was pregnant. And the guy Francis Cooper ...   He is got this girl pregnant and he does not want to marry her.   Oh.   So that is why he is killed her.     As for how it ended up in a song Paul says what likely happened is that this guy Francis Cooper the killer gets caught. And on the day of his execution a songwriter showed up to witness the hanging and then immediately documented it in song which was a common practice at the time.   Very often the sheets themselves were actually sold at public hangings while the condemned man was still swinging.   Wow.   There would be people wandering around selling ballad sheets telling the story of that particular crime.   So it really was like almost journalism.   Yeah yeah. That is a big part of it.   And are these songs usually sung from the perspective of the murderer?   Yeah. It is much more common to tell them in the words of the murderer.   Paul says these songs were actually pretty big business. Songwriters would go to the hangings and then travel from town to town singing the songs for money. They would change the name of the song to match the town that they were in. And thats probably what happened. At some point one of the songwriters hopped on a boat came to East Tennessee changed the song to Knoxville Girl and that was the song that got sung to little Dolly Parton on her porch. Perhaps one way to see Dollys early sad ass songs period is that she was taking these songs that she heard as a girl you know these pulpy ballads of men brutally killing nameless women sung almost always from the perspective of the men and she was flipping it so that you finally heard from the victim.   Now Dolly was not the only person to do this to sing from the victim's point of view. When we spoke with longtime journalist and historian Robert Orman he told us you gotta add that caveat.   It is not that she is the only one it is that she is better than anybody else.   He said she just had a knack for imagining lives that were not being seen. Like what is it like to be that woman at the bottom of the river? Let me tell her story.   There are few finer songwriters male or female.   Mind you shes writing all these songs when shes 21.     I believe this is the earliest recorded interview that exists of Dolly Parton. Its 1967 Nashville. She is being interviewed by a guy named Everett Corbin from the Music City News.       She talks about her family. How there were 12 kids.     How they grew up in this little cabin in the mountains worked the fields piled into the same bed at night.       Now there is no earth-shattering information on that tape but what I take from it is just like wow that is a very different human being coming to us from a very different world. That interview is 52 years ago and Dolly Parton is still making music. So I think it would be a disservice to her to just focus on the sad ass songs. And one of the things you see over the next couple decades is a really interesting shift.   Hello?   And for this I want to bring back Helen Morales.   Hi Jad.   If you recall she was the one who wrote the book Pilgrimage To Dollywood she was the one who urged us dont focus on the boob jokes look at the lyrics. And one of the things that you do see she said if you look at the lyrics from the sad ass songs of '67 '68 '69 '70 up until now you see a progression that is the progression of women in America.   You know her lyrics go from songs like ...     The only out is to walk over me.    Just to prove that I love you I will crawl at your feet.     I still cannot believe those.   That is a little BDSM actually.   Well exactly. The pleasure is in being treated badly. And then -- then she moves on to songs that really are calling men out for cheating on women for behaving badly.     You do not know love from shinola.     One of the great lyrics.     You as not worth the salt in my tears. Women are angry about where the pleasure is in leaving men or in -- in being angry. And then in the final one she moves onto songs where men are less important and it is just -- it is just about women improving their lives.   And what is a good example of that phase?   Well things like you know some of her most recent music Changes.     I know you have got a world of problems and you think you cannot do anything to solve them. But I am here to tell you that you can. Something got you down got you chained and bound well break it. If you have built a wall and now it needs to fall then shake it.   Yes!     So the progression is basically from these very vivid portraits of misery to fight songs to this third phase which is -- are songs that maybe they are a little more self-help-y. They are certainly not just about men and women anymore. Oftentimes there is no men involved. And sometimes you do not get the vivid detail of the sad ass songs but what you get instead is a kind of relentless optimism. A relentless hope that you cannot bring me down. You can joke about me all you want to but I am gonna keep going. And its partly for this reason that Helen Morales refers to Dollys music in her book as not just music but as a toolkit for living.   I mean her song Light of a Clear Blue Morning has really helped me out of many a blue period.   And what is it about that song?   The lyrics just convey a sense of being very confident that things are not okay now but they will be okay.   Can you describe a moment or the time in your life where that song served you or helped you?   Thats producer Shima Oliaee by the way.   You want me to go back to my worst moments?   Yes please!   That is very un-Dolly Parton-like.   That is very Dolly Parton-like.   So yeah there was a -- yes I am not sure I want to talk about that on the radio. I am not going to give you a specific example actually. I do in the book. I talk about when my sister was caught cheating at Oxford and I just played that song on a loop. I am not sure that that is going to go down. That did not go down very well in the book I am not sure I want to talk about that on the radio.   Sure. Okay. Okay yeah yeah. Fair enough.   I would be happy to read some out of the book if you wanted a snapshot of where I used her lyrics.   Do you mind? I mean ...   I do not mind. If you want that I am happy to do that. Which one would you like?   You mentioned your sister. So maybe that one?   Okay. Okay. It is true that one of the reasons Dolly Parton matters so much to me is that her songs have underscored special moments or heightened episodes in my life. One snapshot is of a weekend in July 1998. Newspaper journalists are laying siege outside my mother's home. One of my younger sisters has been caught cheating in her final exams at Oxford University and because she is also president-elect of the student union on a free education-for-all ticket the press is out for blood. My mother is not taking it well and insists that this scandal will devastate my brother her youngest child. My brother is sitting at the computer enthusiastically looking up famous alleged exam cheats and announcing them in thrilled tones. 'Jeffery Archer!' We open the newspapers. One has a photo of our mum's house which in reality is a nice three bedroom Victorian terraced house. The photo has the adjoining houses edited out so that it looks like a mansion. The spin in the accompanying article is 'How the mighty have fallen.' The photograph in the next paper makes our house look like a slum. The spin of this article is 'Look what happens when you let Greek Cypriot immigrants into the country.' 'Richard Branson!' yells my brother. It is not a calm summer. My mother develops agoraphobia. I put Light Of A Clear Blue Morning on my stereo and wear out the cassette tape playing it over and over.     Oh my God. That sounds horrible.   Oh yeah. It was -- sometimes having a song that you can play over and over is really helpful.   Coming up we meet someone who not only listened to the sad ass songs but lived them and turned out to be a real-life Dolly doppelganger. I am Jad Abumrad. Dolly Parton's America will continue in a moment.       You know one beautiful thing that happened to me in Nashville is one of my Uber drivers gave me a charger for my phone. Portable. And she had a Wonder Woman sticker on it. And it was just a beautiful moment. And she is like Take it. And I am like Really? No! She is like It is yours.   Wow. That is Dolly Parton's America right there.   Yeah.   Okay. This is Dolly Parton's America. I am Jad Abumrad here with producer Shima Oliaee. We are at the beginning of a nine-part series where we dive into the life and music of the one and only Dolly Parton. What can she tell us about America? That is sort of the question. I know we started this episode by saying that a lot of people of my generation men mostly tended to see Dolly Parton one way.     And one of the reasons I wanted to do this series and by the way Shima is gonna help me narrate this segment.   Hey!   Hello! So one of the reasons we wanted to do this is -- well maybe you should just take it from here.   Well yeah. One of the big things that first got us thinking about Dolly Parton to begin with is that in the last couple of years she seems to have gone from this thing that you described from this idea you described to mean something much deeper and much more hopeful for a new generation of women.   I think Dolly Parton is an angel. I am not gonna say she is God but she is definitely heaven-sent. And I think that she makes the world a better place.   She just exudes amazingness.   We do not deserve her.   Is that -- I dont even know if thats a word.   Dolly for me is like when I see her and I think of her I feel more confident in myself.   She is like the epitome of female power.   She is everything.   Well she is just the greatest person on Earth.   I truly think that she is one of the most underrated feminist icons of our time.   So one of the big questions for us was how do we even start to explain the shift?   Well I have a little bit of a theory.   This is Sarah Smarsh. She wrote a book called Heartland and she is written a lot about Dolly a lot about class.   And just to add Sarah has been kind of a spirit guide for us in our journeys into the Dollyverse.   Definitely.   My vague theory is that she was like the OG third-wave feminist.   Let me give some context to that.   Please.   First wave feminism when people talk about that they usually mean this group of women in the 1800s and early 1900s who were fighting for their rights. Second-wave feminism ...     This was sort of Dollys era. It was the feminism of the 1970s and '80s. It is where you had a lot of women start rejecting traditional roles in both the workplace and the home.   That is a moment when women who had her business ambitions were being encouraged to sort of downplay their own quote unquote femininity.   You do not need to wear make-up you can cut your hair short. You can put on the pants. And Sarah says that during this second wave Dolly is one of the first to represent the future third wave.   She went like in the opposite direction. It was like You have a problem with my tits? Then here they are hanging out.   My tits hanging out pushing 'em out there. 'Course I played it up.   And you can deal with it while I make you my employee. And there is something about that that is sort of like I think a more kind of millennial spirit of approach to feminism.   One of the women I spoke to Red Sagalow talked about it this way.   There is this idea of what feminists are supposed to look like. They are supposed to like not shave and they are supposed to like burn their bras and all this bullshit. And it is like no feminism can be whatever the f it is you want it to be as a woman. You want to have big hair and big boobs and wear rhinestones then do it.   She I believe was the pioneer on that one. Sort of like you know the way that -- the way that evolution happens. There is -- at any given moment there is like some deviation and then it takes -- it takes time for that to swell and natural selection to take place. Like among a field of second-generation flowers she was like a third-generation spirit.   The way that Sarah tells it Dolly was kind of like the mutation. One of the first special flowers in this field. And then her flower power spread to all the other flowers until the entire field was filled with third-wave Dolly flowers.   Yeah.   Brings us to present day.   Sarah was really curious to see what Dolly thought of this idea. So in one of our conversations I asked her.   Do you think of yourself as a feminist?   No I do not.   She shot that right down.   I think of myself as a woman in business. I love men. And I -- I really -- because I have a dad I have all those brothers all my uncles I love my grandpas I love. And I relate to them. And I write a lot of songs about women because I am a woman or I just write songs that women experience. But I write a lot of songs for men. In fact Ive had hit songs you know about men. I write -- you know I write songs about my dad. The Dinner Bucket song Every time I hear the sound of a train coming down the railroad track hear a big jet plane flying high I would like to throw my hammer down ride off to some distant town not even take the time to say goodbye. But I got to think about my babies about my you know My wife and my old ladies. About how much shed miss me if I was gone. So I write about working men I write about gamblers I write about -- but I write songs for men and about men and their feelings too because I know how they feel. I look like a woman but I think like a man. But I think like a woman too.   But the -- the idea of Dolly Parton the feminist bugs you in some way Im gathering.   Well that word fem -- I guess when you say feminist its just what I think at the time. Like everybody goes to extremes sometimes. I do not like extreme things. I do believe in making a point and making it well. I dont believe in crucifying a whole group just because a few people have made mistakes. To me when you say just the word feminist is like I hate all men.   So did she say no? Or she just like was evasive?   No she like recoiled.   Hmm.   Like which surprised me. You know I thought -- I dont know. It was like I dropped a word bomb in the room.   Mm-hmm. Well I think she knows -- and of course I cant speculate but I think that -- let me put it through my own experience. I had a very complicated relationship to the term feminist when I was a teenager in rural Kansas. Fox News was kind of a new phenomenon in the '90s.     We didnt have cable news in our farmhouse but ...     You know like the culture was starting to shift.     This sort of like backlash that is full-throated now was like burgeoning when I was a teenager. And I could feel it. And I -- I had absorbed that just using the word feminism it had some kind of I dont know. It felt vaguely negative and I was hesitant about the term.   So you would -- you would now identify as a feminist?   Of course.   Does it bother you a tiny bit that she wont?   Yeah. But I wanna say like the part of me thats pissed off is the part of me that got to go to college.   Hmm.   The thing to know about Sarah is that she grew up poor 40 miles outside of Wichita Kansas. She said one of her chores growing up was quote-unquote slopping the hogs. She ultimately was able to scrape together enough money from four jobs and a scholarship to enter the University of Kansas which was just a few hours up the road. But she told us that you cannot overstate how far those two worlds feel from each other. The world she came from of farmers and laborers who mistrust the systems that have ultimately failed them and the world of people who live in cities who run those systems. And she says certain words they have a different life in those two worlds.   But there are women who as we speak are living the tenets of feminism more strongly and in a more badass manner than women who wear the word on a t-shirt and march in the marches. And yet ...   What do you think of that word even?   I do not think it -- no.   Would not take that term on themselves.   She gave the example of her grandma.   I think that men and women should be paid equally. There is just a lot of things that -- well that I do not necessarily agree with. And you are going to ask me what it is and I cannot tell you because I do not know.   But -- so maybe just introduce yourself. Tell me who you are.   I am Grandma Betty.   In talking with Sarah about this distance and about Dolly she kept bringing up her grandma and she is like If you met my grandma you would know what I mean.   I am a little nervous. Can you tell?   Oh yeah yeah. No no. This is great. This is great.   Your first time being interviewed by anybody other than me I believe.   That is true.   She totally did not want to be interviewed. She did it I think as a favor to Sarah. And mostly because she loves Dolly.   I think that she sings like an angel.     In any case Betty was born just a few months before Dolly Parton.   Well I was born in '45. So ...   When is this?   Well thats an oldie.   She showed us pictures of her from 1967 the same year that Dolly did that interview you heard earlier.     And thats me.   And thats your beehive.   And in the pictures ...   So you look just like Dolly.   My hair did.    Oh my God. That is totally ...   It is -- it is identical.   Betty told us that she was a really rebellious kid growing up. She skipped school a lot. She got into fights mostly with rich kids who bullied her and her cousins.   Oh yeah. I mean that is the way that I dealt with things back then. You know somebody give me any crap you know you shoot it right back. You do not walk away.   She told us about this one time when she was 17 and she was at home. And then her mom's ex-husband showed up.   He was drunk of course. They had broken up and he came to the house one night. And he was drinking drunk. And I was -- I had already gone to bed. And I could hear him in there arguing. And he called my mother a pig. And I got out of the bed and I went in there and said Do not call my mother a pig. Ever. And I went back to the bedroom. And then they continued arguing. I heard him call her a pig again. And I got up and went in there and said This is it. I picked up a cast iron skillet that had grease in it and I whammed him upside the head and it knocked him down. But he got up and he staggered to the front porch and then he fell off the porch. And that is how it happened because he called my mother a pig and I told him not to do that.   Wow. Thats -- that is amazing.     My grandma grew up working on factory floors waiting tables in diners on interstates and highways. And so you know she doesnt take any lip.   Sarah says that her grandma was the person that all the women in the family would come to when they had problems. Nonetheless by the time Betty was 30 years she would been married seven times. Most of those husbands had beaten or abused her. One had even shot her in the shoulder. Sarah told us about this one time when they were together and her grandma kind of popped her jaw in and out. Like clicked her jaw. And then said matter of factly ...   That was a gift from one of my sweethearts.   Mmm.   You know it is heartbreaking to me to think about her enduring something like that. But I also kind of thought like What a bad bitch you know? But as far as you know ever letting on like just by an inch that she had been hurt or had any sense of victimhood is like no.   She said that was just totally taboo. But Sarah says there was always this one moment where she would get to see what was happening underneath. It was when theyd be driving to the groceries and her grandma would pop in a cassette tape of Dolly Partons Coat of Many Colors.   I just like never saw this woman crack and that song -- damn!   Can we play it?   Sure.   We sat and listened to it in the living room.     Coat of Many Colors is of course about ...     ... a little girl who is so proud of this coat that her mother sews for her from scraps. That is the only way that she is going to have warmth in the winter. She is proud of the coat. It is beautiful to her. And when she enters school she is shamed for it.     It is about poverty yes. But it is also about a little girl who is being told to be ashamed and she is saying I refuse to be ashamed.     Thanks. Sorry guys. It just brings back so many memories.   What does it -- what do you think of?   I think about my grandma sewing. Sewing my dresses. And you know kids making fun of it. And I think that is why I became such a badass because you know it is -- it is hurtful when people make fun of you. And my way to react was to knock the hell out of them you know? Youre crying too. Thats my story.   When Grandma Betty would listen to Dolly's music Dolly was singing the song she did not have the space in her life to sing.   It is hailing outside.   Is it?   Hailing?   Ooh welcome to Kansas.   It is sunny and it is hailing?   That means we are a month away from tornado season.   And then towards the end of the interview she surprised us and told us something else. She said that after her seventh husband died Arnie -- he was the one guy who treated her well by the way. After he died she decided to sell the farm. And then as she is packing up her stuff moving all the things out ...   And we had 50-gallon barrels that we burnt trash in.   And I think an old bathtub.   And I took my nylons and my tight-fitting bras and threw them in the barrel and threw a match.   She burned her bra!   Did you really?   I really did.   Thats legit feminism then. Thats by the book.   Yeah. That is the way it was. Hi Charlie.   Hello Charlie.   Charlie is Sarah's cat and she sort of walked in to be like Okay you all. Interview's over now. And as we were walking away I kept thinking clearly the lenses we have to see each other the words that we use to describe each other they are just not good enough.   And maybe Dolly moves in that space where those words fail.   My friends call me the Dolly Mama you know? And I am gonna write a whole book on just sayings and just how to ...   By the way after our Kansas adventure we went back to Dolly one more time and I took that question that I asked her and reframed it in light of something that we had seen and that Sarah Smarsh had told us. That there are the feminists in theory but there are also the feminists in practice.   And she puts you in that category.   That is the one. Thats me. That is me.   Like its about how you live.   Yes that is a good way to say it. I think that is a good way of saying it. I live it. I work it. And I think there is power in it for me.   By the way the idea that feminists burned their bras? Total myth.   Did not happen.   Never happened.   They almost did.   They -- yeah they ...   But they could not get the fire started. Is that right?   No it was they needed a permit to light the bra on fire and they did not have the permit.   Really?   And that is why they were like Oh I guess we cannot do that. So they just threw the bras in the trash.   Oh!   Never set it on fire.   Wow!   Grandma Betty's the only one.    Excellent.   I am gonna go burn bras right now.   Okay.

No it bridges -- it bridges out from biography and it goes into some strange kind of mental imaginary places that I am excited to see if people stay with it.
