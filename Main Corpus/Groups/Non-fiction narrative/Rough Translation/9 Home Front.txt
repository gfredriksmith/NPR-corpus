 You are listening to ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. John Wong  was a college student at UC San Diego when he enlisted in the Marine Reserves the summer of 2001. He graduated boot camp the week of 911.  That was a bit of a shocker.   Like planes stopped flying. The people that were supposed to come for the graduation could not come.  His parents lived close by. So days later they were able to take him out to celebrate.  I am not exactly sure why they chose Applebee's. I think it had just opened up. And it was just kind of like oh let us try something new.  So there he is in his new uniform khaki shirt olive green pants. And he is flipping through that huge menu they have when another diner got up from his table...  And just said you know I do not want to interrupt your dinner. But I just want to say thank you for your service. I kind of stammered out a your welcome or something like that. I felt like an imposter like I am just wearing this costume. And it was not until the second person really struck in my mind because it happened not too long after that first person. I think we were still - I still had a menu in my hands. I remember he wore a polo shirt tucked into his jeans for some reason. And this person actually put their shoulder - it was an older man. He put his hand on my shoulder as he was kind of leaning in to say thank you.   John was 19. It was the first time he would ever felt so on display. But it was also the first time that many service people around the country were hearing this phrase thank you for your service. It was not commonly said during Vietnam. John heard it from five different people in the time between salad and dessert.  By the time that dinner ended I realized that I was in a different world that there was a difference between what I was with my military ID in my pocket and what people around me were. I did not have a sense at that point - I did not realize that I would never be able to go back to that other side.   There is a name for the divide that he felt. It is called the civilian-military divide - the civ-mil divide. A while back we asked you to tell us...  Hi ROUGH TRANSLATION.  ...If you would ever felt that divide in your lives.  Hi ROUGH TRANSLATION.  This is ROUGH TRANSLATION.  Hey Gregory.  I am Gregory Warner.  Hi NPR.  Usually on this show we are telling you stories about cultural disconnects in other countries stories from far off places that hit close to home. But today we are doing something a little different. We are introducing a series of stories about a divide right here in the U.S..  I heard your call-out..  For the civ-mil podcast...  Which was a question I had never been asked before...  How do you bridge the civilian-military divide?  In the last 20 years and two wars only 1 of Americans have served which if you just think about that for a second these were some of our longest and most expensive wars and yet fought with the smallest percentage of our population. When we asked you our listeners for stories of the civ-mil divide most of the people we heard from were military. And you told us how acutely aware you are to be part of a tiny minority of people who volunteered for a job that most people do not sign up for.  This is me. This is me. This is so me.  I think we live in sort of increasingly isolated tribes in America.  I generally do not talk to civilians. I just yell at them.  When my husband decided to enlist the response from all of our friends and family I mean it was shock complete shock.  People can forget that we have been at war for 20 years because they were never at war in the first place.  The first thing I tried to do when I heard about the show was reason with myself that I have got to have some friends and some connections of people who are not in the military. And I came to the conclusion that I really do not.  The civ-mil divide in the United States how you are dealing with it why it is there and what it might mean for all of us. Your stories when ROUGH TRANSLATION returns.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I am Gregory Warner. My co-host on this series reported for 12 years in Iraq and Afghanistan. He is now the vets correspondent for NPR Quil Lawrence. Hey Quil.  Hey Gregory.  So you pitched us this series on the civ-mil divide. And the series has a name.  HomeFront.  And it is home-slash-front. So what like...  That is right.  What does that mean?  Well the idea is that home and the front did not used to be so separated - I mean in times of war anyway. Everybody at home had someone at the front. And you can trace that all the way back to the end of the draft.   The draft lottery - a live report on tonight's...   The director of selective service is going to establish tonight a random selection...  So every major war in American history was fought with a draft up through Vietnam.   In 1970.  And when you have a draft you have millions of families wondering if their son or their brother or their dad their friend is going to be called up. And practically every American family is touched by the war.   September 14.  There are 366 numbers to select one for each birthday in the year plus one for...  October...  That all changed after Vietnam because now it is an all-volunteer force. It is a choice. It is a choice that very few people make. Mostly the people who enlist they already have a connection. They know someone already in the military. It is usually family. And instead of being a shared experience for the whole country it is become almost a family tradition which means that more than ever before in America we have a kind of warrior class.  I did not come from a traditional military family. But my brother joined ahead of me. And I said I will be damned if he gets to hold this over me the rest of our lives.  Bjorn Hanson  is a listener who sent us this voicemail about being a reservist.  I was told I was going to Iraq. I deployed 2007 to Baghdad and came home in the summer of 2008. Within weeks of coming home we were being asked if we wanted to redeploy.   He ends up going to war in early 2010 returning in mid-2011.  In time to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary.  Here's the thing about fighting a 20-year war with 1 of the population people like Bjorn end up deploying again and again.  Which is such a different experience compared to our predecessors in World War II Korea Vietnam or even the Gulf War where service members so often did their tour and got out.  In 2015 and then again in 2018 Bjorn got calls to prepare to deploy. He did not end up going to war then. But he says he still feels the civ-mil divide every time he gets one of these calls whether he is sent or not. He finds himself mentally checking out of civilian life. And that takes a toll.  The cycling back and forth by the same people is a burden that is tough to comprehend.  Then there is Fernando Rivero .  The civ-mil divide to me is...  He is a Navy reservist I know from Afghanistan.  ...There is just fewer people that know somebody that is in the military.  When he is not on active duty he is a Hollywood producer. He told me the story from when he was single but hoping to settle down and raise a family.  I may be gone for six months or a year. And girls by and large were like yeah I do not know if I can deal with that. It was kind of a nonstarter.  If he was just back from his deployment...  They sort of back off you know like you had a disease. And I do not want to get it. Or I do not really know how to deal with it. Like sometimes there was just sort of an uncomfortable incuriousness. Like I really do not want to know more about this because it is not interesting or I cannot relate to it which is isolating you know?  Isolation is something I hear a lot from veterans. They feel isolated and alone when people do not ask questions. But it is also possible to you know ask the wrong question.  She was frozen. She looked astonished with the question.   Then the conversation came to a screeching halt. And we all sort of looked at each other like where do we go from here?  My husband and I have had so many conversations about how challenging it is to make friends in the civilian world.  I try very hard not to ask questions because I have learned that they will share what they feel comfortable sharing.  Dan Price served in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne.  So I was warned ahead of time when I was getting out of the Army that civilians would ask this question.   They would ask if you have seen combat if you have been shot at.  Dan has kind of a measured way of speaking about this because he does not necessarily want to give the true answer which is that he never came under direct fire.  If I tell them that it is that mild then I miss all of the anxiety about going out on missions and then all of the sadness of missing family events. I mean it was not trivial just because I did not get shot at or I did not shoot back.  The majority of vets never got shot at and never shot back.  It was still very intense. And sometimes when I end up going into that it makes me question whether or not I actually did anything.  A random question from a stranger could make him doubt his years of service and his family's sacrifice just chatting with his co-workers could be a minefield he said. Until he solved this problem of talking across the divide with a kind of PR strategy. He is got prepackaged answers and jokes.  When I get asked if I have been shot at I say not by anything bigger than a rocket.   Most of you who responded to our call-out were military. But civilians also told us stories of awkward prematurely halted conversations. People on both sides seem to worry what the others would think how they might be judged from across the divide something that Raeanne Lambert thinks about pretty much every day she goes to work.  I am a civilian physician who works for the VA. And there are some visits - it comes to the point where the patient asks are you a veteran? And I kind of dread that question because I know I am going to disappoint them with my answer.   Because no matter how much they like me or how caring I was - and I really do care - they are going to realize that I cannot possibly understand. I cannot really get it.  That phrase...  You do not understand.  ...So many of you said it.  Some civilians do not understand.  You will never understand.  People who do not understand.  But at the same token you have to understand.   Some of you told us that that divide between civilians and military was not always a bad thing. Sometimes it could be leveraged for special perks.   My name is Caitlin Sheehan . And I am a therapeutic backcountry expedition leader for veterans with disabilities. I am a veteran. And it is not something that people assume because I am a very petite very bubbly smiley gal.  Caitlin she wanted everyone to know she is a vet.  When I first got out of the military I had a license plate that had one of the medals.  It is one of those custom license plates you can get that says veteran and expeditionary forces medal on it.  I got it so that I could speed with abandon and without any accountability.  When she did get stopped by police she could usually get out of a ticket as long as the cop did not make a different assumption about veterans.  The officer would ask me who owned the vehicle? And I would say I do. And they would say who else is on the title? I just - I remember this one time this officer asked and I looked right at him and I said well sir would you believe they let these ladies play military these days? And  he went bright red. And I think out of embarrassment guised as patriotism you know he let me part without fine.   Getting out of a speeding ticket sounds pretty benign a small privilege extracted from the gulf of misunderstanding between civilians and the military. When ROUGH TRANSLATIONS HomeFront returns veterans tell us about the danger that can come when that misunderstanding is exploited in more serious ways after this break.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION's special series HomeFront. This is the first episode of the series where we ask you to tell us your stories of navigating the civ-mil divide in your personal lives. You told us how it makes it hard for you to talk to each other or make friends or stay rooted in civilian life. But next we are going to tell you about a moment a few years back that people in the military are still puzzling over a moment when the usually private misunderstanding between civilians and the military was thrust out into the open.  It was kind of this thing like well did you hear that? Did he just say what I think he just said?  At a White House press conference.   Who are these young men and women? They are the best 1 this country produces. Most of you as Americans do not know them.  So this is in 2017. And what is happened is that four American soldiers have been killed in West Africa. And the - President Trump ends up making some condolence calls.   We have some breaking news to report to you right now. President Trump finally...  On one of these calls he allegedly just told this widow well you know your husband knew what he signed up for...   The president to be so insensitive. Not only...  ...Which some people saw as really insensitive. And that is when Marine General John Kelly who was Trump's chief of staff at the time convened this press conference.   Most Americans do not know what happens...  And he basically says you know I do not think most of you know what happens when one of our service members is killed overseas.   Their buddies wrap them up in whatever passes as a shroud puts them on a helicopter as a routine and sends them home.  And he starts talking about how you pack the body in ice.   Packed in ice typically at the air head. And then they are flown to usually Europe. So that is the process. While that is happening...  John Kelly is telling this to the White House press corps. Many of these journalists know that Kelly's son was killed in Afghanistan. He is a gold star father. He got that visit from a casualty officer. And this press conference is the first time he is spoken so publicly about it.   Let me tell you what my best friend Joe Dunford told me because he was my casualty officer. He said Kell  he was doing exactly what he wanted to do when he was killed. He knew what he was getting into by joining the - that 1. He knew what the possibilities were because we are at war.   I mean it was just amazing that he spoke about this.  And to a lot of the civilian journalists in the room it felt like Kelly in sharing this very personal experience of his own was reaching across the divide.  Yeah. I mean he is trying at the beginning of this press conference. That is what it felt like at first.  But then it is time for questions.   I am willing to take a question or two.  And Kelly makes a request.   Is anyone here a gold star parent or sibling? Does anyone here know a gold star parent or sibling? OK. You get the question.  Thank you General Kelly. First of all you have a great deal of respect. Semper Fi for everything...  He says all right. If you are a gold star family member or you know someone then good you get the first question.   But then...   Any other - someone who knows a gold star...  ...He takes some more questions. And it becomes clear that these are the only people he is going to allow questions from.   Take one more. But it is got to be form someone who knows - all right.  To this day I talk with military people who say oh yeah the John Kelly presser. I mean they see this moment as a very dangerous precedent where a White House official says you are not allowed to question him if you are fully on the civilian side of the civ-mil divide. I do not know if Kelly realized how this would sound. But some saw him as chipping away at this basic tenet of our democracy that civilians are supposed to oversee the military.  At the end of this press conference Kelly makes one more remark that seems to really dig in this divide. He says you know we in the military it is not that we look down on you.   We do not look down upon those of you that have not served. In fact in a way we are a little bit sorry because you will never have experienced the wonderful joy you get in your heart when you do the kind of things our servicemen and women do not for any other reason than they love this country. So just think of that. And I do appreciate your time.   We have to - as veterans and service members and military families we have to reject that gut reaction immediate instinct to say oh you could not understand.  Kayla Williams is in Iraq vet. She is also an assistant secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  When I first got out of the military I definitely bought into believing that nobody could understand what I went through if they had not worn the uniform. And I came to reject that idea and believe that civilians have an obligation to try to understand. And that is the only way we are going to bridge this is to try to meet one another halfway.   What Kayla is saying rings so true for me. I am a civilian. I never served. But I cross this divide all the time. It is one of the reasons I pitched this series is to sort of show civilians and veterans this crossing is possible and it is necessary.  And so that is what we are going to be doing with Quil Lawrence on this feed for the next two months. We are going to tell you stories about ordinary people who cross into unfamiliar territory...  I got no phone number. I got no website. I have no Internet.  ...Who feel completely unprepared for the task ahead...  And I am a military guy. I do not know squat about companies. I do not even have a business degree.  ...People who show up where they just do not belong.  I cannot remember if she came in on rollerblades at that time or not. But she had a habit of rollerblading down the hallways of the Senate office buildings because it is very smooth.  And yet all of these stories manage to show us...  I used some of my best lines on Alicia . I told her I would die for her.  I will die for you - it is like you are a soldier you will die for anyone.   ...In a marriage in a business meeting in a war what is possible when we cross this divide.
