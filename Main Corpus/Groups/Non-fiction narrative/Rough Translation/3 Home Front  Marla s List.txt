 You are listening to ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. In April of 2003 a few weeks after the fall of Saddam Hussein Marc Garlasco arrived in Iraq on a mission to investigate war crimes for Human Rights Watch. And kind of as soon as he gets there...  You know people kept speaking about this one person. They are saying oh you have got to meet Marla. You have got to meet Marla. I cannot wait till you meet Marla.   And it was funny because you know I have no conception who this person is. I do not know if she is you know some bigwig or if she is some State Department person or who it is. They keep talking about her in the vein of you know oh civilian casualties and whatnot. Yeah yeah. She is really important. You need to meet her.   And then one night he is at a party.  And all of a sudden this California blond incredibly young just flits across the room - meeting everyone speaking to everyone. And at some point she comes up to me. And it was not hi I am Marla. Hi. Nice to meet you. It was Marc how are you? So nice to see you. We have got - I have got work for you. Your skills are so important to us and are really going to come into play. And there is a meeting I need you to go to tomorrow with the U.S. military. And I will let you know the specifics about it. And it is just great to have you here.  You have been recruited.  It was not a request. It was this is  what you are going to do. And I went to the meeting the next day.   This is ROUGH TRANSLATION's HomeFront our series with Quil Lawrence. I am Gregory Warner. If you heard last week's episode you remember that when Marla Ruzicka first showed up in Iraq and Afghanistan before that she was not exactly the kind of person who anyone thought they had to meet. She had no job no budget no apparent role in a war zone. If you did not hear that episode it is called Marla's War.   I work for an organization every day...  Marla started out as a staunch and vocal antiwar activist.    No blood for oil.  But her experiences in Afghanistan spending time with the victims of war changed her mind.   I think it is actually a luxury to be against war because war happens. And I think we have to change war. We have to change the impact that it has on civilians.   To understand how Marla set out to change war's impact we have to tell you not just about what she got done but what she got so many people around her to do - people who she enlisted in her mission sometimes before they would ever met her before they would heard her name certainly before they realized how they fit into her plan.   Like my mom called me an operator.  How would you define this term operator?  Operator it is like  mover shaker. Hell yeah I am an operator - like the biggest operator you will ever meet. But like I am proud to be an operator if it is an operator for other people.  Today we are going to look at how Marla operated in a war zone. We are going to meet three people who she recruited - a Pentagon weapons expert an Army lawyer and a general - to rethink the military's balance sheet of war. And we will hear the toll that that would take on her.   Here's Quil Lawrence.  Marla had an incredibly simple message.   Does not matter if you were for or against the war - innocent civilians should not be harmed in conflict. And when they are you must investigate the case. And you must help them reconstruct their lives.  She rejected the idea that war is hell. And innocent people get hurt. And there is nothing you can do about it.   What they call collateral damage - a word I hate because when you go out door to door you meet the families. It is not a number. They are people. They are families. And they deserve...  In 2002 after Marla got back from Afghanistan she convinced the Senate to appropriate millions of dollars for Afghan victims of war. Shall I bring the box over here?  Yeah sure.  OK cool.  .  And as soon as the war started in Iraq she turned her attention to civilians there.  OK.  When was last time we went through this box?  I have not gone through it to be honest.  Tara Sutton was one of Marla's best friends in Iraq. She is now the keeper of Marla's list.  Oh. This is a list of all the cases that she - you remember she did the survey.  Yep.  This is it.  Marla needed evidence of civilian casualties in Iraq so she could get them compensation. So she hired a team of Iraqi researchers.  She got all of these people to spread out across the country go to every single hospital.  They collected not only people's names but their number of dependents they had the cause of injury.  OK. Cause of injury shrapnel shrapnel break shrapnel shrapnel burns break leg...  Yeah.  ...Eye neck bullets missile attack where it took place.  Marla was not just documenting the names of Iraqis who were killed or injured.  Abbas Illaoi age 56 gender male marital status married occupation businessman supporting 16...  Wow.  ...Dead.  She was also keeping a detailed account of how she was doing. Course I remember...  Yes. Look at this. It is like...  ...How it is singed.  ...Oh. Thursday no cigs like Bridget Jones - she always kept a little tally of you know one wine one cigarette.  She kept a diary of her own struggles and her own mental state.  I think that so many people who struggle with mental health have an extra layer of sensitivity.  It was only later that she would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder.  She really felt the pain of everybody because she was in touch with her own pain. She did not really have skin in a way. When she was in those - whether she was manic or she was depressed I think that she struggled immensely. And that is why she could feel so much for other people. She was just like I try. Every day I try. Every day I wake up and say I am going to be a better Marla.   We have worked on a case for three months with the little girl Iat 5 years old. A tank ran over her car killing her mother and father. But when we presented this case to the military they told her to go to...  Marla had told me that the Iraqi civilians she would met felt like the Americans who were supposed to be liberating Iraq just did not care about them.   So they just kind of feel like well do we matter? And that is how many people felt under the former regime. And that is what we are trying to change. We want Iraq to get off to the right start. We want people to feel that nobody operates with impunity.  This is from an interview I did with Marla in 2004 and I was joking with her about it.   Honey you have gotten really good at this.   Sorry.  That was so smooth and solid.   No...  She sounded so different from the anti-war activist who I first met in Afghanistan. I mean phrases like make sure Iraq gets off to the right start - you can hear that she is been practicing this around Washington. But it was never just a line with Marla. I mean she believes it. She believes that Americans civilians and military wanted to do the right thing in Iraq.   The overall impact that this has the U.S. not going out investigating these cases is something that comes back to the impunity question. They think that people can get away with anything. When they feel that they are operating like that we have a major hearts-and-minds issue that is going to be very damaging to rectify. We can start to rectify it and make security for Iraqis and American soldiers much better by setting up a clear system of compensation.   Marla was making this case to the U.S. military. And the U.S. military will tell you they do more than almost any other military on Earth to try to kill just their enemies just the people they are aiming at. There is informal lingo for this. It is pretty dark. They call it putting warheads on foreheads. And one person whose job it was to put a warhead on the right forehead was the guy we introduced at the top of the show Marc Garlasco. Would you object if I described you as a gifted ballistics and munitions nerd? Is that fair?  I guess that is generous.  Before Marc took the job investigating war crimes for Human Rights Watch he worked at the Pentagon.  So I was chief of high-value targeting and my job was to locate track and kill Saddam Hussein which we did not do a very good job at.  I have seen Marc go to a bomb site and tell you based on some scrap of burnt metal what kind of round was fired and who fired it and from where. And when he was at the Pentagon part of his job was to look at proposed targets and try to estimate how many civilians might be accidentally killed if you dropped a bomb there.  And the rule was if on any target you had 30 or more anticipated civilians that were going to be killed that you had to get national command authority. So either President Bush or Secretary Rumsfeld had to personally sign off on those attacks.  Marc like Marla thought that America should do better than that.   A week after leaving the Pentagon he was in Iraq in the crater of a bomb that he himself had targeted. When Marc learned that there was an Iraqi village that was surrounded by bits of unexploded ordnance little bomblets that are just waiting to go off it was actually Marla who told him exactly where to go and who to talk to in the military to get those bombs cleared up.  I went in to the demining guys - to the U.S. military's demining guys - and said hey I was just out at this site. I have got the GPS coordinates for you for a strike. And the guy's like who the hell are you? I said oh I am with Human Rights Watch. And he was like Human what? I explained look. I have got the coordinates for bomblets that are in a civilian area. And he is just looking at me like I have no idea what to do with you. And I said to him Marla sent me. And he said oh well why did not you tell me Marla sent you? And that was it. You know she was an opening. She opened doors.  So she had schmoozed this guy or...  Marla schmoozed everybody. Let us face facts. Marla schmoozed everyone.   She would recruit anyone she thought would help her cause whether it was Marc or the demining guys or really anyone with boots on the ground. One time Marc is out in Baghdad and an armored vehicle pulls up and this soldier shouts down at him you have to leave. It is too dangerous.  You got to get out of here. You should not be here. I screamed up. I said you know hey we are here to do interviews. You know we are here with Marla. And he is like oh Marla's here? Like all right no problem. You know we will create a security cordon for you. And you know just let us know when you are done. Marla had an ability to co-opt people and to pull them into her sphere and to explain to them this is the right thing to do and so we are going to do it.  And Marla changed how Marc thought of his job. In fact when he would meet Iraqi civilians who needed help he would sometimes give them Marla's business card along with his own and tell them look. Human Rights Watch cannot really help you.  I cannot do anything for you but there is this person and I am going to put you in contact with her and she is going to be able to help you to meet with the right people in the government so that you can get what you need.  By this point Marla had founded an organization she called stands for the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict.  I understood you know the humanity of what Marla was doing because even if you could not get people help you were still there for them.  But this job that Marla's taken on keeps getting bigger and bigger. Casualties are mounting. She is knocking on more and more doors. Then she is trying to bring in more allies from the military to help her.   I mean I train my locals. I train them how to do it and stuff but they cannot like walk up to a military guy and be like dude  you know I am having a party .  For Marla parties were where she got people to work together.   I wanted everyone to talk to each other and I wanted everyone to like each other.  Where she kept track of what people were working on and how they might help her. And it is also where she recruited people to her side. And that was work.  And I remember I would rub her head. Like she would put her head in my lap in the living room and I would like rub her head and rub her shoulders and like just kind of try to get her not to go out. I was just like Marla just stay here. Like just do not - you do not have to go anywhere. Like just stay here.  But Marla had more people to meet and more people to recruit. That is when ROUGH TRANSLATION's HomeFront returns.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION's HomeFront. I am Gregory Warner. The evidence that Marla gathered of civilian casualties in Iraq and her advocacy on their behalf helped her convince the Senate to establish a fund for Iraqi civilians hurt in war. And that money went to provide people with medical care and to help them start businesses and other things. But distributing that money took time and she was meeting families who needed more immediate help. The military was there on the ground and she wanted the military to notice these casualties and do something about them. And then she found someone in the military who was noticing it and who was doing something which brings us to our second Marla recruit.  Jon Tracy. I was a captain in the U.S. Army.  I never knew Jon Tracy's name at the time because Marla never used people's names. She always had like some descriptor for them. So she used to just call him my JAG.  Lawyers in the Army are called JAGS. It stands for judge advocate general.  She met JAG Tracy. I remember her always talking about him . She would be like I am going jogging with my JAG. And I think they really hit it off - right? - because he had such a humanitarian heart.   JAG Tracy.  Yeah.  I met him. He is the claims officer for compensation. He is a judge advocate general.  Where is he from?  He is from Virginia.  Does he have an accent?  And he is my friend. No no.  Every single time I would say you know my name is Jon. If you really want to be military about it you can call me Captain Tracy. She was like no no Your title is JAG Tracy.  It is funny. You were like if you really want to be military about it. But she did not want to be military about it. She was doing her own thing.  That is right yeah.   The JAG Corps was created in 1775 by George Washington. So for as long as the U.S. has had an Army the Army's had lawyers. But Jon surprised his friends when he enlisted in the Army after law school.  I do not like the idea of saluting. I do not like the idea of uniforms. I do not like the idea of being told to make my bed every morning and having it inspected.  Jon's brother and father had served and he found he hated working at law firms. He liked the idea of having an adventure. And besides surely the Army would not send lawyers to a combat zone.  I do not know what lawyers would do. So what am I going to be worried about?  I mean for basic training they put him up in an Econo Lodge.  The day that we were supposed to do the obstacle course there was a light sprinkle. So they canceled it and we all got the day off. It was not until near the end of basic course that I was told where I was going.  He was going to Baghdad.  And then when I finally got there those first few weeks it is just people coming to say hey a Humvee ran into my car or this or that. Oh this will be easy. This is not that hard of a job. You know I just look at the car. He brings me a bill from some mechanic. It says you know it was 400 to fix this. And I give him 400 and everybody's happy.   Many JAGs in Iraq were based at Baghdad Airport and not interacting much with ordinary Iraqis doing things like helping soldiers figure out their taxes or their divorces. But Jon was stationed with a brigade in downtown Baghdad. He discovered that most of his time actually was spent doing something called foreign claims - paying people whose property had been accidentally damaged by the military. Jon found he did not mind this work. He is handy with a spreadsheet likes to get things done.  I thought if this is the next 12 months then how bad can this really be? But slowly as you know time progressed throughout the summer and more and more people were coming with these combat stories it changed the dynamics.  See - the thing about the Foreign Claims Act which goes back to World War II it has something called...  The combat exclusion which basically says this statute does not cover anything that is quote unquote related to combat.  So on that first day you get these 40 cases. And 35 of them are coming in and saying you ruined my car. And you could say all right you know prove it and we will pay for your car. But if they came in and said you injured me or you killed a member of my family you could not do anything.  That is exactly right.  Jon hated having to turn people away. And he remembered that there was this other way the military could compensate people. It was not as well-known as Foreign Claims. In fact in his JAG training class Jon had only heard it mentioned once in passing.  Like a little sound bite sort of amount of time spent on what the military has called solatia - the solatia program.  Solatia is the Latin root of the word solace and console.  With solatia the idea was a particular unit could take some money and offer a nominal amount to the victim of a combat operation as a mere sign of sympathy and nothing more.  Solatia had a monetary cap.  Twenty-five hundred dollars for a life 1500 for property damage and 1000 for personal injury.  Those were the nominal amounts. But the Army had not even set aside money to pay them. So Jon got creative. And he ended up leaning on a friend of his in the brigade who managed the budget for reconstruction projects like rebuilding wells and the Baghdad Zoo. And he asked him how much he had left over each week.  And I got the remainder basically. He would look at me and say well this week I can give you 8000. And the next week it would be I can give you 11000.  And what was your demand each week? How many...  Growing.  ...Thousand dollars' worth of - did you need each week?  Way more than that.  Jon did not just find a way to get the money. Two days a week he would go to an Iraqi government building with his translator Zeynab to hear people's stories. In fact just like Marla was keeping her list Jon was entering these names in his spreadsheet - the woman whose husband was killed in his own store by stray bullets or the couple whose three children were killed in the back seat when they did not stop their car at a checkpoint.  We would show up and start seeing people at 9 a.m. But we would be out of money by 15. The most difficult part of the job was - between my translator and I we would have to prioritize about what we felt most deserved the money and pay those people and then keep telling the people on the lower list try to come back early the next week. Try to come back early you know the next day I am out here. And we will see what we can do. But that list just kept growing and growing.   Jon felt like the cleanup crew for a war that was getting deadlier every day.  I mean when you open the door to your office and you see a line of 80 people sitting in the hallway there is a certain level of frustration that overcomes you where you do wish - like I would much prefer to be at Baghdad airport you know working on somebody 1040. That seems like an infinitely better life.   These are boxes of misery - file after file documenting death and injury.  So when CNN called and asked to film him doing his work he did not call his boss or the media relations office and ask for permission to speak to the media.   How much is he looking for?  Twice a week Captain Jonathan Tracy a military lawyer meets with those seeking money for damages including deaths caused by U.S. troops.  And was that a small act of rebellion on your part?  I mean I viewed it somewhat like that.  The way that Jon tells himself this whole story that he decided to take this small risk it is missing one crucial detail which is that the person who told CNN about him and gave CNN his cellphone number was Marla who Jon had not yet met though she would heard about him. And maybe she would intuited that any military lawyer who was patient enough to spend two days a week sorting through combat stories to pay condolences might also be frustrated enough to break press protocols. The day after CNN came to film him Marla showed up in person.  I was near the stairs. And she was jumping up it - I mean you know taking three at a time and had this big huge smile on her face and just did not look like anybody else looked inside the convention center or inside Iraq for that matter.  Marla's been collecting her list of claims - this big bag of file folders.  I said why do not you just come into the office? And we can talk right now and see what you have.  But then she sees this line of Iraqis waiting to tell their stories to Jon.  And so when she turned and she saw all those people I believe she said something like holy s. I am not cutting. So let us meet some other time. And I said well OK. But it is perfectly fine for you to cut. I mean I am going to get to all these people one way or the other. But she refused to cut in the line.  When Jon and Marla finally sit down together he realizes that she is listening to stories like he is. But while he can only help people who find a way to come in to his office Marla and her team are going out to hospitals and bomb sites around the country. And they are starting to compile a much fuller account of civilian casualties.  Meeting with all of these people in their living rooms and talking to them - I was definitely inspired by what she was doing and what she was putting herself through. And I wanted to provide any kind of support that I could.   Once she is teamed up with Jon Tracy Marla's not just making a list. She is actually getting those people money from the military.  Eventually I got to the point where I trusted them. And I would give the money to Faiz. And then he would go down and give it to the family.  Faiz Ali Salim is Marla's right-hand man. He is managing her organization hdad. And he is also her driver and her translator. And Jon Tracy kind of ends up deputizing both Marla and Faiz.  I think what surprised her the most is when I explained to her this is what I do and this is why I am allowed to do it. And the shock that she had was - is well then why are not they all doing that? Why is it that - you know at the time there was 27 brigades in Iraq approximately. So why are there not 27 lawyers who are paying every cent that they have?  Did your bosses or your colleagues - did anyone ever say to you hey this is great work that you are doing you know listening to all these stories and...  I mean not too much. A number of them knew what I was doing and figured oh yeah that is good. You are out there winning hearts and minds. But I do not - there is no threat of negative ramifications if you did less than what I did. In a lot of ways you are sort of on your own. You make your own job.  Marla needed Jon Tracy to make good on the promises she would made to people to get them help. But Jon realized he also needed Marla.  There was definitely a level of darkness that surrounded what I was doing and where I was doing it and how I was doing it.  But Marla would tell him you are not the cleanup crew. You are doing important work.  She was constantly calling Zeynab and I angels. I tried to disavow her of that.  Marla would greet you with a barrage of compliments about how amazing you were all the time.  I just remember her coming to me and she would sort of go like you are so amazing. You are so beautiful. You are the prettiest girl in Baghdad.  You are incredible. You sound wonderful. You are so handsome and smart. I know that you are doing this great work. I am doing this cool work too. You know how you can help me? And suddenly you were just doing whatever it was that she needed.  And she made you feel a lot better after she was around.  Marla gave Jon Tracy a sense of mission he was not getting from the Army. Did you ever feel like you needed to give her that encouragement?  I mean it is probably selfish to say but no because I knew one dimension of her this super confident super positive and super loving person and I just absorbed it. But I never really thought to give it back to her because it looked like she was overbrimming with that.  These were her appointments. Appointments for Thursday 24 of March - please confirm. Like this is just - this is just a diary of tragedy. Eleven-year-old kid - leg amputated and shrapnel all over body. This one says teenager around 18 was injured at a checkpoint by U.S. Army. She was severely injured in the skull. She needs plastic surgery. What made her so depressed was like every single one of these stories was then like I have to solve this problem you know? I mean no wonder she would drink.  There was always kind of this concern about have you guys seen Marla? Did she look OK today? Did she have breakfast? You know just simple things like that.  It became clear to even people who were as kind of oblivious to this sort of thing as I am that she had an eating disorder as well. She never ate anything but salad. And then like I would wake up in the suite that we were sharing at that time for example and I would come out of my bedroom and she was you know still sound asleep in hers. And I would go to the kitchen and I would find like a pack of cold cuts with like a giant bite through the whole thing like an enormous mouse had nibbled on - like through all 10 slices of salami or whatever it was.   I mean you know that eating disorders are really really common in like high-achieving young women who put a lot of pressure on themselves.  Cat Philp who had met Marla in Afghanistan - when she sees her in Iraq she is just surprised to see how much weight Marla has lost.  She would said to me that anorexia was her only friend...  Whoa.  ...Which is a really hard thing to understand when you have never had anorexia the idea of a disorder being your friend.  Why do you - do you have any idea what she meant?  I suppose it was kind of a comfort thing because - so the thing was like there was no friend that was there all the time. And even though she would like call me and email every day and stuff I was not there.  And it was sort of amazing to watch her you know fall apart every night and then rebuilding herself every morning and then fall apart again you know? Like she would go through the day holding on to the idea of like I am not going to like get so drunk I pass out. I am not going to you know - and then she would do it. And then she would wake up again and try all over again.   It took my toll on me. You saw me when I was not healthy. You saw me when I just was so obsessed with work. I was in the care of myself.  But Iraq keeps tugging at her.   You know part of it is my priority and my relationship I have with the families. And there is just nothing like being in the field. You just cannot do what you can do in the field anywhere else. And you are depressed. You feel worthless when you are not there you know? Just - because you just cannot do the same stuff there.  Marla also worried that she was not getting the traction with the military that she would hoped for not just in compensating people that were hurt but in keeping a full record.  They were just like we do not count. We do not count.  Despite all of Marla's appeals to the Pentagon the U.S. military was still publicly saying that it did not count civilian casualties.  Well why do not you count? Why do not you count? You count everything else. That is what she said. You keep track of every bullet you know? Every bullet every missile is accounted for. But yet oh we shot somebody at a roadblock or we destroyed their house. We do not count that.  But was it true that they were not counting? That question brings Marla back to Baghdad one last time when ROUGH TRANSLATION's HomeFront returns.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION's HomeFront. I am Quil Lawrence. A few of Marla's friends did a kind of intervention. We asked her to stay out of war zones and to take care of herself. Her friend Cat Philp a journalist with the Times of London traveled with her almost like a chaperone back to Marla's home in California where Marla got diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started taking medication. Then Cat got sent out on an assignment. But then they meet back up at Cat's apartment in New Delhi. It is late January 2005. And Cat remembers the two of them having this really leisurely morning sitting around drinking coffee and catching up reading old newspapers and feeling far away from the war in Iraq. And then Cat turns the page to a photograph.  One particularly striking photo of a little girl covered in the blood of her parents both of whom were killed and crying.  It is a story about another Iraqi family killed at an American checkpoint.  And then Marla got up. And she looked at it and she went oh my God have you seen this? And I went I know. It is horrible. The parents were killed and that little girl - it is unbearable. And she went no no no. And she would read the text.  The caption of the photo said that the troops after this tragic accident had written down the names in what is called a spot report.  They would filled out a form with the casualties. And I still did not get it. I was like yeah OK. And she went that means they keep a record. There is a form. There is an actual form. And she went but this is what they have always denied they have done. And that was kind of the kernel of an idea that she carried back to Baghdad with her that after all this time that she spent looking into the casualties and the records of the casualties that the military were keeping the numbers all along which they would always denied.   So youre going to Baghdad now?  In like 12 hours.  In like 12 hours.  Twenty-four hours - I will be at Baghdad. I will be on my way to Baghdad. Got to prep for my Bag  debut. I have to you know get the clothes right.  She says she is got a plan in Baghdad. She does not say much about it but she tells Cat she is going to try to get the numbers of civilian casualties.   I am going to try to do this checkpoint stuff. I am going to try to see if they give me the documents do the best I can.  Which brings us to Baghdad in 2005 and our third Marla recruit.  My name is Karl Horst. I retired from the Army in 2013 at the rank of major general.  General Horst was a brigadier in charge of security for all of Baghdad in 2005. This is a time when the violence is staggering.  It is just a damn dangerous place.  So the general was surprised to say the least when he got an alert over the radio from one of his troops at a checkpoint.   They said there is a civilian at the checkpoint wants to talk about civilian casualties.  He goes down there and he finds...  A young Caucasian female blonde hair which you do not really see a lot of those in Baghdad.  It is Marla who proceeds to tell him about her organization CIVIC. But she is not just talking about her work. She also wants to hear about his.  She was very much in transmit. But she was also polite enough to switch the transmitter off and go to receive mode. It was a dialogue about this situation. And what struck me about her was her sincerity about what she was doing. And let us be honest she was an American. She was from our tribe.  He felt as so many people did when they were talking with Marla he wanted to continue the conversation.  I gave her my cell phone number. I said look if you get in trouble I want you to call me.  She does call him. And he invites her to the dining hall on base where she asks him point blank...  She says well you know how many civilians have you killed? I said I do not know. That is not a data point that is important to me on a day-to-day basis. I said you know I can go back and look in the logs.  He is going to check the logs - the logs of the spot reports the form that Marla realized existed when she saw that caption on that photograph in the newspaper...   ...Which means that Marla's hunch was right. The military was compiling civilian casualty data. This data was not being widely shared even within the military. So for instance while Jon Tracy could request a particular spot report to verify a claim that he was investigating General Horst had the rank to be able to walk into his office and get a complete tally of the casualty report numbers for his region.  Yeah we tracked every action that happened particularly when people would blow through a checkpoint or something like that. You know that was a major report.  Had anybody anybody in
