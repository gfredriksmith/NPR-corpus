 You are listening to ROUGH TRANSLATION from NPR. I am Gregory Warner. And today a story from Uganda about a woman who has elevated insults to an art form that even the president of her country Yoweri Museveni has not been able to ignore.   Yoweri they say it was your birthday yesterday - how bitterly sad a day.  Now before we go further a language alert - this episode includes language that is vulgar and is sexual in nature. It is by far the most explicit episode I have ever worked on. It might be the most graphic thing in your podcast feed right now. And so it goes without saying some of you may not find this appropriate for kids or safe for work. But we have left this language unbleeped because this episode is all about the art of the inappropriate and the role of incivility and put-downs in politics in a country that prides itself on being highly proper and where being seen as vulgar can have severe consequences which brings us back to this birthday poem about the president's birth to his late mother Esteri.   Yoweri they say it was your birthday yesterday - how painfully ugly a day. I wish the lice-filled bush of dirty pubic hair overgrown all over Esiteri's unwashed chuchu  had strangled you at birth strangled you just like the long tentacles of corruption you sowed and watered into our bleeding economy. I wish the infectious dirty-brown discharge flooding Esiteri's loose pussy had drowned you to death drowned you as vilely as you have sank and murdered the dreams and aspirations of millions of youths who languish in the deep sea of massive unemployment and underemployment in Uganda.  Uganda is a very conservative and very Christian country. A majority of Ugandans say that they would approve of the Bible being the law of the land. During the AIDS epidemic President Museveni organized abstinence pride parades. And more recently his government proposed a ban on miniskirts and the death penalty for being gay. It is a country where you get political power by claiming to defend morality. The author of this poem Stella Nyanzi was put on trial and sentenced to 18 months in prison.   Yoweri they say it was your birthday yesterday - how traumatically wasted a day. I wish the poisoned uterus sitting just above Esiteri's dry clitoris had prematurely miscarried a thing to be cast upon a manure pit prematurely miscarried just like you prematurely aborted any semblance of democracy good governance and rule of law.   This is NPR's ROUGH TRANSLATION with the last in our series School of Scandal. I am Gregory Warner. Today we have an origin story about how an elite academic queer feminist scholar became a populist hero in a deeply conservative Christian country. Stella and people like her are spearheading a shift in how the art of politics is waged in other African countries. She turned crass insults into a merciless force. But this is also a really intimate story about the price of that both to Stella and to her family. ROUGH TRANSLATION - back after these messages.   We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I am Gregory Warner.   Am I hearing crickets on your end or is that just audio?  You might. No there might be crickets and I cannot believe you can hear that on WhatsApp.  We first heard about Stella Nyanzi from NPR's East Africa correspondent Eyder Peralta. Eyder first met Stella before she would written the birthday poem. She would already spent time in jail for other poetry she would written about the president.  One of the first things she told me was like where can we go where I will not be poisoned? We drove to a cafe on the rooftop of a hotel. I order coffee. She orders some tea.  So what records? Is it this or that? Or...  No this records. And then she looks at my left hand where I have - I have what used to be a sixth finger.  Hey you have a little finger - another one.  I do.  Was it operated or not?  It was.  Cut it off.   Did it have a bone? I have always wondered do they have bones inside?  I do not think it had a bone just tissue.  Just flesh - sorry I am just rude again. But...  And that was like the thing that like - that I was always self-conscious about. Right? And the idea that she would pick up...  She sort of smelled it.  ...On that immediately. She smelled me.  She smelled it on you.  Right right. She is very purposely trying to put you in an uncomfortable spot. I mean that is what she does in her activism and that is what she was doing right there.   Stella learned her curiosity about the human body from her father a successful doctor and a district medical officer for the region. He used to take Stella on walks and quiz her about anatomy. And her dad always emphasized that Stella and her three sisters were special destined for great things. Stella's youngest sister Sheila remembers this phrase that her dad used.  He always said oh  you know? We Nyanzis do not do that. And you had that pride of - excuse me I am a Nyanzi.  You did not wear jeans or drink from a plastic cup. Quitting was not allowed nor was being shy. And the sisters were expected to have respectable careers. Sheila the youngest became a corporate lawyer while Stella became a research fellow at the Makerere Institute of Social Research or MISR housed at one of the most prestigious universities on the continent. But she used that respectable post to research something seen as taboo.  Having a scholar in Uganda working on homosexuality during that very homophobic time queering what MISR. I had queers you know sashaying into MISR any time.  President Museveni he has said we know people who are rumored to be gay. And I think one of the things that Stella Nyanzi did was she documented that gay people do exist.  Like homosexuality is not just a foreign import. It is something...  Right.  ...That - there are real flesh-and-blood Ugandans who are gay and lesbian.  Yes. And that is - and I think that is huge. And it is coming from a university that is respected.  I am read in like medical anthropology journals. I am doing culture health and sexuality. And in my own area at that time - sexuality - there were not very many Africans writing about African sexualities and contributing into these spaces.  Stella told Eyder this really was her dream job. She felt free to research what she wanted and she had the respect of a tenure-track academic with invites to conferences and media panels and a nice office and a salary to raise her three kids as a single mom.  I come in thinking permanent and pensionable right?  A permanent and pensionable job.  And for me it is like liberation. The dream was to be like la professeur the go-to professor for African sexualities specifically Uganda.   And then one summer day in 2014 when her father was in his late 60s he had a stroke. It came upon him gradually as some strokes do. And as a doctor he not only realized he was having a stroke he was able to call up the nearest clinic and tell them exactly the anti-clotting medication that might save his life.  My father knew. He is educated. He is gone to Michigan for crying out loud.   And he went - he went she says to three different clinics and they did not have the medicine for him.  He died that night of a heart attack in the backseat of a car still searching for that medication.   I am like how does a medical doctor die? He has all the knowledge he needs. He just needs the government to provide services for hospitals. I think in that moment I realized we are impotent as the middle class.  Stella calls herself middle class because she grew up with formal dinners and a library with works of Nietzsche. But now she felt like a fool to think that their family's education or their accomplishments or their status could protect them from the country's problems.  I knew it as a fact. I thought my dick was so hot. I should have been part of the struggle for a long long time. But I think for me that is when I - when it comes home that Museveni's not good for us he is bad. How can Daddy die because there is no medicine?  And exactly a year after her father dies for the lack of a vial of medicine her mother collapses in her yard and she dies because there is no ambulance to come pick her up in time.  And for me - people say I am insane. But I hold Museveni directly responsible for my father's death. Did his murder my father? Of course. Did he murder my mother? Give her an ambulance. She was there languishing. There is no ambulance.  We reached out to the Ugandan government several times for comment on this story. They did not respond.  But Stella is not the only one drawing a connection between the endemic corruption that Museveni's regime has enabled and the poor state of the country's health care. One report that came out around this time from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS TB and Malaria it found that 70 of Ugandan clinics they visited had run out of key medicines. And that is even though the government had been given the money by international donors to buy these medicines.  Stella's sister Sheila watched how the death of her parents changed Stella.  My father died like a common man. He was not common man. And that was what really fueled Stella.  Stella had always been antiauthoritarian. There is a tree in their grade school called the punishment tree. It has many of young carvings on it. The tree was a place where kids were supposed to stand in shame but Stella turned it into a platform. But then after her parents died something changed.  The two people she feared are dead - Daddy Mummy - everybody else not even herself. I think her sense of self-preservation departed.  The breaking point for Stella came after something seemingly small a dispute with her boss at the university one that will be probably familiar to many in academia. The university wanted her to teach classes. She said she would been hired as a researcher not a teacher. They said she was not publishing enough to be a researcher. It went on like this and eventually she was suspended.  And she is told by the university that she will no longer have access to her office - that they are going to take everything out that they are going to change the locks and she will not have access to this space that she really loved.  And she pulls out all her middle-class connections to restore that post. She even hires a lawyer to sue the university.  I brought letters. They said why did not she write letters? I did. What did not she try counsel? I did. I tried so hard and nobody cared.   And so early one morning she shows up at her old office with padlocks and a bucket of red paint. She would invited journalists to come film her.  And she starts her protest by just painting like some of the offices red.  She barricades herself with the padlocks behind the burglar bars that separate her block of offices.   Why is no one taking...  You hear the administrator telling her you know like we can talk about this. You do not have to do this.   You are right. You are right.  ...University I am protected.  This university...  You are right. You are right.  People are trying to talk her off a ledge right? It is super chaotic. She is moving back and forth like along this corridor.  Police show up to cut the locks. One of the biggest Ugandan TV stations NTV starts airing all this live.  They are airing this protest and more police arrive. They start cutting the chains.  As they got there I was like fuck it. I am finished. I am finished.  Right? And she knows that she does not have much more time. And she is live on television.  At the time when mothers and children are having breakfast.  Whatever she does right now will livestream into hundreds of thousands of Ugandan homes.  And then you know - like you know my brain works in like these amazing ways. Schwee .  That is when the bra comes off. And everybody pauses.  Stella is topless on national TV. And her sister Sheila is watching.  So Makerere - Makerere was an absolute shocker for all of us.  So you had not talked about that with Stella?  No. But I know why she did not say to me anything - because she knew I would restrain her. I am her only brakes in her life.  So you would have told her what? Like fine - lock yourself up in the office but do not take off your clothes? Like I mean where would you have braked her?  Um - I think the execution would be different. Clothes I do not - they are her clothes. It is her body. It is not mine you know? So I do not have a right over that.  To Eyder's surprise it was not her sister's nakedness that bothered Sheila the corporate lawyer. Even though Uganda is a conservative country there is a tradition both here and on the continent of women particularly mothers using nudity as protest.  And these protests they go way back. Some researchers have found examples in the 17th century in what was now Nigeria. Women protested the brutality of the ruler of the oil empire.   And Nigerian women used it again against the British in the '20s. Women in Soweto protested naked against the apartheid regime and Stella Nyanzi's protest came just about a year after a group of women in northern Uganda stripped naked to stop the government from taking their land. But to Sheila there was an important difference between all these protests and what her big sister had done in the university. These are usually groups of women.  Why did you go alone? So I think from a strategic perspective I would have said to Stella - you know what? - bring more people on board. Execute it with numbers to give it credibility.   I mean even Stella's friend Dr. Sylvia Tamale who was the first woman dean of the law school at Makerere and who had studied these kinds of protests she begged Stella to put on her clothes. And then a while later Tamale gave a lecture about this incident. And she wrote that in this moment - and I am quoting her - she says I was shocked and horrified embarrassed and ashamed. I thought my friend had completely lost it. The immediate reaction was that this professor this you know - Dr. Stella Nyanzi had gone mad. And people commented on her breasts.  My breasts are special. They are just long and ugly and fat and they have veins. And when you are angry they look angry. When you are happy they look happy - like you know breasts with special expressions.  They made cartoons that showed her on top of her boss in bed and he is in a stupor. The caption is how Stella got her keys back. And I think if there was supposed to be some greater politics or philosophy to this it was lost.  If the motive was really about having an office then we failed. Oh poor Stella you failed. No do not misread me.  Her protest she says was not about getting her job back. It was more like an expression of rage and grief at being powerless on the heels of her parents' death because they were ignored.  What was the motive? Everybody had ignored me. I pushed and pushed. I tried so hard and nobody cared. But that day everybody paid attention. They acted and I do not care. They listened. They stopped. They looked. They discussed. They . They misunderstood. But they listened. They got it. Do you get me?  Stella in that moment topless on TV declared herself a word in the Luganda language. She calls herself a nalongo a mother of twins - which is true. Stella has an older daughter and two twin boys. But a nalongo in Uganda is also a title. And in fact once you give birth to twins there is this very elaborate ceremony that happens.  .  They also spend the whole night singing these just incredibly vulgar songs. Hamida Namatovu Chuwanoka is an expert in these ceremonies. She conducts them herself and she sung one of these songs to us.  .  The new mom of twins is allowed to steal. In fact it is an honor to be stolen from by her. And she can curse. The ceremony celebrates the art of cursing.  The words were very very vulgar. Like where she says she might not  is like vagina . It is so big it would burst like a sweet potato.   She is saying a vagina so big it would burst like a baked sweet potato.  A thing that was not clear to me when listening to the nalongo thing...  This by the way is our producer Tina Antolini.  ...Is a big vagina a good thing to have or is it a bad thing to have?  Well - so for this it is a very good thing to have. In this ceremony a big vagina is celebrated. It is something to be proud of because there is so much pain in childbirth that pushing out one child is hard enough. To push out two is almost superhuman.  The nalongo ceremony with its songs and its rituals is meant to neutralize the vagina power. Without which ritual it is believed that all kinds of curses would be unleashed.  The twins will curse your family and the girls will not get married and the matooke plantations will not have food and you will have insane people and your men will not erect. So Stella the academic is like what a bunch of hogwash. But Stella the performer knows that to protect herself she is got to claim her nalongoship  and do the nalongo thing.  But if Stella did not believe the tradition she instinctively understood the effect it would have on her audience watching over breakfast. In fact Stella in her university protest proclaims herself not just a nalongo.  She is saying nalongo owenene which the translation is the mother of twins with the big vagina.  .  Hamida thinks that in that moment Stella went too far.  .  The sort of ability to be vulgar and ability to go beyond societal norms that is supposed to stay within that ceremony.  She broke with the tradition.  That was truly the moment that Stella Nyanzi became a huge deal in Uganda.  She gets all this attention on social media and she starts using it to vent her frustration with the president and the first lady.  They are so used to policy critiques. They know it is coming. They are prepared for it. They do not give a fuck. They have money invested into normalizing critique and unjust zombifying . Is there such a word as zombifying? Like we are dead to the critique of the university guys and World Bank and foreigners and experts.  At this point Stella gets really bold.  She writes about the first lady Janet Museveni that she is not going to be another Ugandan licking her boots. Stella says she is going to lick her clitoris.  And this is coming at a time when the president is warning against oral sex saying that the mouth is for eating.  She also calls the president matako butako a pair of buttocks.  Matako butako like it is not a pair of buttocks. It is - like you are just - you are nothing more than just a pair of buttocks. Like if it is shitting all over the country it is just a pair of buttocks.  She gets even more attention and then she runs away to direct that attention toward a real cause.  Which is that during the 2016 campaign the president and the first lady promised all girls would have pads in school.  Because if you are poor and you cannot afford pads you miss a lot of school. So that is the campaign promise. But then after the president wins his fifth term the government says well they do not actually have money to do this.  And Stella Nyanzi sees an opening. She goes to her Facebook page which now has thousands of followers. And she says hey guys the government is not doing this. Like I am going to deliver pads to girls.  And so many people respond. Stella and her sister Sheila who is organizing this collect thousands of pads.  And the day that she is going to deliver pads to a school in the first lady's home territory that is when she is arrested not for delivering pads but for insulting the president.  For calling him a pair of buttocks.  I mean I do not know if it had been a man if it had been someone with particular clout it would make sense. But ah who is that just laughing at the king?  Now if the president's aim with that arrest had been to shut down the joke it did not work. Stella's arrest prompted headlines around the world. The hashtag PairOfButtocks started to trend. But Eyder believes that was actually part of the government's strategy.  To say they were arresting her for delivering pads would be admitting that this woman did what you could not do. And not only did she shame the president she shamed his wife.  So arresting Stella for shaming things she wrote about him was actually the president's attempt to shame her.  Right - by morality because it works in Uganda.  And Museveni had used this strategy in the past when he was under attack for corruption or government failures. He would take that moment to propose these moralistic laws like that ban on miniskirts or the death penalty for LGBTQ people. And even when these laws were never expected to pass they worked as a distraction. And so now he was turning the tables on Stella calling her shameless and bad for Uganda. And Sheila was furious at her sister. Why did she hijack the pads campaign by again calling attention to herself?  And she laughed and said no I do not want your corporate nature I do not want your diplomacy I do not want your anything Sheila. I do not want to sanitize this process. I want it to be as dirty as you know the people we are speaking to because they play dirty. We want to play dirty you know? She always says  fire for fire an eye for an eye.  The official charge against Stella for the buttocks line was offensive communication also cyber harassment because she had written it on Facebook.  This is not the best thing that I have written or the worst thing I have written about the president.  It says something about Stella's opinion of her own work - that she would have preferred to have been arrested for a more eloquent use of vulgarity than this one phrase because she took pride in elevating these street insults to the level of poetry which is why the most painful moment of the trial for her was hearing her own words read aloud in court by the detective on the case.  It is terrible. He is reading pussy and calling it pus-y . You know he is calling cunt candy.  Like cunt he calls it candy. And he is reading so badly and he is calling pubic lice public lice. Like come on. You are doing injustice to this thing.  Even as they are putting her on trial for vulgarity she feels like they are vulgarizing her words.  Then I understood they do not get it. Like at one point I got so sad. Like they would never ever understand the symbol.  Would Ugandan's understand that she was trying to show contempt for a government that had shown contempt for them? Or would she just be seen as attention seeking and a bit mad? Stella after this became even more outspoken. Not long after she wrote that birthday poem that we quoted at the beginning of the episode and that was treated very seriously. She was sentenced to a year and a half. And as Eyder went back and forth to Uganda reporting this story he started to notice a shift.  The last time that I went to Uganda the immigration guy asked me what are you here for? And I said oh I am here - you know I am doing a story about Stella Nyanzi. And he says what do you think of Stella Nyanzi? And I told him oh you know I think she is interesting. And he says she is not interesting she is brave. Right? This was a government official saying that. And that was not what you heard of Stella Nyanzi when she was protesting against her boss at the university. But when her target went to the president that changed things. That changed the way Ugandans viewed Stella Nyanzi - and not just her nakedness but also her rudeness.  After the break the price paid by Stella's children and how Eyder comes up with a desperate plan to meet Stella behind bars.   Wait. That is not a chicken. That is a cock.  That is coming up when ROUGH TRANSLATION returns.   Hey. We are back with ROUGH TRANSLATION. I am Gregory Warner. Back at the end of last year when Eyder Peralta pitched us this story Stella Nyanzi was still in prison for that birthday poem that she would written to the president.   I wish the lice-filled bush of dirty pubic hair overgrown all over Esiteri's unwashed chuchu had strangled you at birth.  That is the one. But while Stella was in prison her reputation was growing internationally.  Academics are writing essays and papers about her. Mona Eltahawy who is this prominent Egyptian American feminist dedicated a chapter in her book to Stella. And she paints her as this kind of naked and vulgar revolutionary who is a model for a new way to take on strongmen. And this is especially true in a continent that is full of authoritarian democracies and strongmen who hold elections that they never lose.  But people were not hearing from Stella herself. The prison was not allowing journalists to visit her. Eyder knew very little about how she might be faring behind bars.  So I was in Uganda in December and I wanted to see her in prison. But I mean one of the big problems was that if you go in there and they ask you what you do - right? - you have to say you are a journalist.  You do not actually have to tell the truth to Ugandan prison guards. But as an NPR correspondent we are not supposed to lie to a government authority. So Eyder and his producer Halima Athumani came up with a plan to distract the guards from ever asking them why they were there.   It was around Christmas holiday time and we thought we would take her a chicken because live chickens are allowed in the prison. And you take them live because there is no refrigeration. So the prisoners can receive a live chicken keep it there until they are ready to eat it.   But that is not a chicken. That is a cock. We take chicken. We take some chocolates.  They just want to make it seem like a social call for Christmas. But they also take secret recorders disguised as pens.  You can hear us getting patted down. You can hear our conversations with like the guards and like us walking in and then them telling us to wait. Right?  Sorry. They do not know what we are doing.  And incredibly this plan seems to work. They are not asked questions that they would have to lie to.  We have not been here too long.  But just as they are being led in to visit Stella...   ...They turn on what Eyder now believes was some kind of radio interference to block recordings.   So we do not have tape of this prison encounter. Eyder says it took place in the office of the director of the prison. Stella came in carrying a little mat to sit on.  There was a bunch of chairs there but she was not allowed to use those chairs. We were told to sit down in the chairs and she was told that she had to sit on the floor.  Why was not she allowed to use the chair?  That is the way they treat prisoners there. It is a way to humiliate them.  And so how did Stella seem to you?  I found a completely defiant human. She showed no chip in her armor. So she told us about you know her time in solitary which was - it had to have been pretty horrific. But you know the part that she talked about then was her defiance of it which is that you know she used her excrement to write on the walls that she used you know her hands to try and chip away a message on the walls.  It is in front of the prison director that she is saying all this. She is saying that she scratched her poems onto the prison wall with her handcuffs. She would write freedom is more than liberty just as she would once left carvings on the punishment tree in grade school. And again in front of the prison director she told Eyder how she instructed other women prisoners how they could break the rules against masturbation.  She showed no weakness at all. Right? She did not show that she had any fear of the situation that she was in.  The first time that Eyder met Stella back in 2017 in that cafe where she would pointed out his sixth finger she talked a lot about her mom and the kind of defiance that she would learned from her.  She went to court and told the judges I refuse to give my husband a divorce. But you are saying he is an adulterer. I love my adulterer. And the court case just failed.  Stella says her mom did love her dad. But she was also being strategic. She knew she would have more rights as a married woman than a divorcee.  I think her mother was also insisting on respectability in the most unrespectable way right? She was insisting that this marriage be kept at any cost.  Like she has all these moments where she did crazy things. And maybe it is the gene or the exemplar I got from her.  And just as her mom stayed in a bad marriage because it would give her more power Stella stayed in prison. She refused to apply for bail. She believed that it made the president look weaker for having arrested her in the first place. She was not going to take what she called the middle-class way out - paying money for freedom. But outside the prison her sister Sheila had urged her to apply for bail. Bail meant not missing another Christmas with her kids.  Stella does not understand that her consequences have visited on all us. When she protested in Makerere I lost my job. I did.  Do you really think she does not know that?  She did not give a damn for lack of a better expression. I do not know how you say that in English without reducing the weight of it. She is so driven with the ultimate she does not care for what happens along the way.  Sheila had also taken in Stella's daughter Baraka and the twin boys. And she told Eyder go talk to the kids and you will understand what I mean.  Go talk to them. They are never inside the house. They are always outside. Go find them. So we leave this big house go outside. And Baraka is there.  We are fine. Well if you are asking like - OK no. We are not fine. We are surviving. Yeah.  Baraka is 15 now but she was 12 when her mom was first arrested for stripping at the university. And her mom gave all the kids a speech.  Yeah she gave us a speech you know? You guys will survive. And like you know at that moment when she was telling us this we were like yeah we got this. But you know when you are actually like faced with the situation it is not something you are prepared for.  Before her mom went to prison Baraka was on the swim team and she remembered how her mom would go to all her meets and scream so loudly poolside to cheer her on. When her mom went to prison Baraka quit swimming because she knew it would hurt her.  So the swimming thing was like that kind of like revenge-ish .  Do you guys think all of this is worth it? I have asked her that question too. She thinks it is. Do you guys think it is worth it?  No.  No.  No?  No.  All of you? No?  No.  Even for what it might mean for the country?  She as not owe it to the country she owes it to us not the country.   It was two months after this interview that Stella released a book of poems smuggled out of her prison cell. It is called No Roses From My Mouth. And in it there is another birthday poem. This one is called Missed Birthdays.   My daughter turned 14 years three days into my imprisonment. I failed to fulfill a promise I made her. Her first cappuccino in life I had planned to go to Endiro Cafe in Kisementi to sit and chat with her for hours. Instead I spent that Saturday on the floor of prison surrounded by 63 other prisoners.   Three weeks after that book of poems comes out Stella is released from prison.  I have messed up my kids' lives so many times. How will they - when will they catch up? Where will they catch up with school?  And in this interview she does with Eyder she looks and sounds very different than when he met her sitting on the mat in prison.  She is constantly fainting. Like she just seems to lose control of her body and she collapses. And this is - there is nothing physically wrong with her. So it is trauma. And she is really collapsing everywhere. Like she is trying to get up some stairs and she faints. She paints at the sound of sirens.  When she does fall it is her daughter Baraka who is there to catch her. Baraka is not only constantly by her mom's side she is almost her personal assistant fielding calls from journalists and scheduling her mom's days. And she is not going to school.  I think it is scary that they have grown so much. I think in fighting the regime I have lost them. I lost their innocence. I lost their hugs. So what am I saying? I do not know what I am saying about the children.  So you have to reconnect.  I do. But I think that the person they want to reconnect with is not there someone else is - a very broken person a very angry person. I am now a very bitter person. But the problem is my sort of bitterness now is I will be smiling at you and planning to dig this fork I am eating with - I am eating with a fork and I am eating with you. And I am planning to do something with my fork to you and I am smiling and eating and you are eating and you are thinking I am your friend and then I will k
