  Hey this is Jad. Radiolab is brought to you by the John Templeton Foundation harnessing the power of the sciences to explore the deepest and most perplexing questions facing humankind. Learn about the latest discoveries in the study of hope and optimism intellectual humility and freewill at templeton.org    Oh my god. I weso thisI had...  Hey I am Jad Abumrad.  I am Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab.  And we have another story for you. Another adventure. Uh courtesy of who else?  Well reporter Latif Nasser.  So I the the way I first learned about this story is that I saw that there was this article trending in this online publication called The Players' Tribune which is like in like a kind of athletes' magazine.  Which of course you subscribe to.  Which of course I subscribe to because I am the like scrawniest  I am the like least athletic. I am the only scrawny couch potato basically. But anyway thething that jumped out to me about this article is that it is a sports story but it is it is actually so much more. Like it it is a story about voting. It is a story about cyber bullying. It is a story about you know sticking it to the establishment. It is asports story but it isone that feels like it could only have happened at this very specific moment that we are living in right now.  Yeah I mean I do not know if we can always paint sports as a microcosm of society but in this case it is undeniable that it was.  So the whole story starts with this guy Greg Wyshynski.  What are you guys talking about today?  Hockey stuff.  Oh sweet.  Greg is a hockey journalist.  Senior NHL writer for ESPN.  Known to his legions of fans as Puck Daddy.   Yeah.  Is that a self-given name?  No.  He got it from his editor when he first started blogging about hockey.   The other option at the time was Zamboni Pony.  Oh.  Which would have been a horrible name and I I I very much avoided an entire you know ten-year run of people calling me the Pony.  That is true. Right. But now...  I I I...  Yeah.  I have my notes. I am ready to roll now.  Okay. Well let us just jump in then.  Yeah so...  We are live. Happy happy...  This story really begins on the podcast that I did with a gentleman by the name of Jeff Merrick.  You are in the wrong industry but...  Basically a couple hockey writers.  Just shooting the breeze on hockey.  Well you know what I just see we are in we are in the hockey industry and as you know the hockey hockey industry is about making money making new fans turning heads.  Okay so this is uh November 2015 uh just a few months before the NHLs you know big mid-season spectacle.   The All-Star Game.   There is a sense that I have about this game that that that is worrisome and and and it is hard...  So this year yet again the NHL...  For the hundredth time in the last 15 years.  Was changing the format of the All-Star Game.   Hockey is typically five-on-five three-on-three however is supposed to be you know way more action a lot more scoring a lot more fun. But for Greg and Jeff...  Heres where Im at...  Who are you know these hockey purists they are like yet again the NHL is just changing things up to get more eyeballs on this game that by this point has just become  A watered down half speed...  Joke of a game.  It is not a game. It makes a mockery of it but the...  So the two of them as many die hard hockey traditionalists do go off on the NHL and eventually that leads them to talk about the other what they see as the other really dumb thing about that year's All-Star Game.  Fan voting.  Fan voting has long been a part of the game.  As a kid there was nothing else better than grabbing the little punch card at a game and knocking out the little circles and and trying to grab like 30 of them to make sure that you know Kirk Muller gets a spot in the All-Star Game or whatever.  But over the years the NHL had started reducing the number of players that could get voted in. One year they were even accused ofturning off the vote when they did not like where it was headed. And anyway this year the NHL had limited the votes so much that the fans could only vote in four players a captain for each Division the Pacific the Central the Atlantic the Metropolitan. But four players all you could vote in.  That just seems to run counter to what the All-Star Game history tradition should be to what we really want with this All-Star Game which is fan engagement at the end.  I just hope that everyone that somehow a collective and maybe we can lead the charge here on this one.  And at that point they started thinking What if we use the little voting power that we do have to mess with the All-Star Game?  Wwe need somewe need someone in there who normally would not be in this game.  Like as a joke we should vote somebody in who just does not belong. Hmm. And Greg's like...  I like that thought.  Okay. But who?  Who would fit the bill there?  And as Greg was thinking about it he thought you know what would be funny? You know what would really mess with the NHL is if we thought in a player...  A player who could not really keep up.  Could not really shoot could not really handle the puck.  The slow guy with the bad hands.  Could not do anything.  Let us let us let us really you know drop a stink bomb in the room.  And then it hit him.  The perfect guy.  A Goliath of the league. John Scott.  Oh my gosh. John Scott All-Star.   So John Scott...   Was a behemoth.   He was the guy that would only play between like five and eight minutes a night.   Could not really shoot.   Could not really skate.   And on top of that when John Scott was on the ice.   The only thing he was good at...   Was knocking other people senseless.   In hockey terms.   John Scott was what you would call...   An old fashioned goon.  Oh yes . Oh my God. That is the one. He is the one. He is the guy.  From that point on there was no other answer to the question. Like that was the guy that it would have to be.   John Scott is the one.  And what started there as a tiny joke between two guys on a podcast would end up twisting the fate and fortune of one of the most feared loathed punishing players in the National Hockey League.  Yeah.  You would be quiet. Yeah.  Changed some things for his family too.  Be Soft.  Hello?  Hey. Okay. I am calling you from my cell phone. How is this?  Oh much better.  So this is John.  Yeah we are good. Morgan gave me the thumbs up.  All right great.  He knows.  Okay. So-  Oh yeah my my daughter's here too so if there is like sounds it is just my daughter cruising around.  No that is cute. I love it.  Okay good.  Okay. So I think to really understand what it was like for John to be on the other end of this to be like you know like the butt of a joke you need to understand what hockey meant to John. Like what it meant for him to be playing in the NHL.  Like everyone has their dreams. Like when you are a kid especially in the states it is football baseball. In Canada when you ask a seven eight-year-old wedo those projects in class where do you want to be when you grow up? And I think 90 of the boys are like I am going to be in the NHL. And I always said that my parents have all that stuff all over the walls and stuff. But yeah I always dreamed of playing in the NHL. I think everybodythat was their big dream. So yeah.  So John has this classic Canadian hockey kids story.  I put on skates when I was three my dad built the rink in the backyard.  Played all the time.  Every single day morning noon and night. And you would just go to sleep and your gear and wake up and just jump right on the ice. Skate until seven or eight at night and you would just jump in bed go to sleep.    You just kept it on to save time . So...  But the thing about John was that even as a kid...  I was a monster. I I came out of the womb 24 25 24.5 inches long and I was 11 pounds 12 pounds. I was huge. School pitchers was a joke. Everyone thought I was like a teacher's assistant when I hit like grade 7 8 9 because I was so tall. Andwhen you are young and you are that tall you have zero zero coordination.  And so John was never the top guy in his team.  Never the fastest never the most skilled. Never you know the best at anything. I just kind ofsorry my daughter just started playing the piano beside us...  Yeah...  Is he okay with it?  Are you okay with the piano Latif? I can...  Kick her off.   I will get her off the piano.  Okay. Yeah that would be great. Sorry.   It is cute for a little bit.    That last question was...  All right we are good.  Thanks.  Thanks.  Yeah.  So youoh yeah. So well there is something you said that you...  Here let me let me put her to bed one second. Sorry Latif. I am gonna throw her upstairs in her room.  Cool. No no no. Take your time. Take totally take your time.  Yeah. I will I will keep you on the phone. It will take two seconds. But even if she cries up there alone she will be fine.  Ill follow you is that okay?  Yeah. She is just saying a little squirrely. Good questions there Latif are you from Mississauga?  Yeah I am from Mississauga.  So you are in Boston New York now or...  No so so. Yeah I am calling you from Boston. My cell phone is Boston. Imy job is in New York but I actually live in LA.  Oh wow. You are just like all over the map.  Yeah I am well notI mean I feel like compared to you you have been all over the map for real.   All right. Let me put her right here. You go to bed. All right. Now she is done. Perfect.  Oh my God. What kind of kid do you have? You can put her down so easily.  She is like the best kid ever. It is great. I do not know how we lucked out with her but she was our number five and we needed that.    If she was anything but perfect we would be in trouble. Alright we are back. All right let us let us get back.  Okay. We are back. We are back. We are back.  Okay. Okay. So to jump back in. John plays throughout his school years. By the time he is getting close to college a lot of his friends are getting you know offersscholarships to different you know big time schools University of Minnesota Boston College places like that.  For John there was just no interest. Like coaches thought he was too big to play would not be able to keep up out there on the ice. But eventually he did get one offer to play for a mid-level university Michigan Tech.  And I just figured I would in all honesty I would finish college and get a job. That would be it. I would have gotten an education for free and you know I play hockey with the guys on the weekends but that was that would be the end of hockey.  But then a couple of things happened. First...  At school I kind of always noticed him...  He met Danielle.  Because he was about two feet taller than anybody else on campus.  They were both engineering students started dating senior year.  You know we kind of hit things off and the rest was history.  And the other thing that happened was...  I got this opportunity to go play for the Houston Aeros Minnesotas farm team.  A minor league team.  It was not crazy money. It was 30000 or 35000.  He talked to Danielle about it.  He was like well let me give this hockey thing like a go.  Like this is the only chance I am going to get to be able to say I played pro.  And the way that I kind of looked at it was Oh okay. It is just like a little head start. And then once I graduate like we will both get our jobs like our real jobs and move on with our lives.  So John moved down to Houston.  I did not have any expectations. I just worked my tail off. I was a bad skater. I worked at skating I was a bad passer. I would work at passing after practice but  He says no matter what he did he would not get any playing time.  Well I was always a step or two behind. I was I think the ninth defenceman on the roster and you only dressed six for a game. So I never played the first I think month of the season.  But while John was in Houston he noticed that there were these other big guys on the team and they were getting playing time.  And they kind of took me under their wings and they said Hey listen...  If you really want to get noticed down here if you really want to go to the NHL you should learn how to fight.  It worked perfectly because Ithat is what happened. So for those of you who do not follow hockey too much I have guys on my team...   Who make 10 million 9 million 8 million and they are paid just to score and they are paid to perform and play well.   But there are also guys out there...   Who their job is to...   Pester annoy and we call them the rats the pests.  And you can hear these guys like when they are Mic'd up.  How are you even here? Like 10 guys here right now!  Running their mouth.  What are you doing out here?  They try to get under this star player's skin.  The ugliest guy in the league. Ugliest.  They will jab and poke at these star players but sometime...   They will use their stick to hack at them or they will check them into the board.   Like theyll try to really hurt them.   So in order to deal with pests you got people like John who are called enforcers.  So basically my job is to make sure those pests do not pester my top guys. And so when we would go into a game I would know exactly who to pinpoint because you know you do your scouting and I would go up to those guys and I would say hey listen if you are going to do that I am going to put my fist through your face. And more often than not just the fear of the retribution if they did something would would stop them.   But if they did do something my job was to...   Beat them up.   I was a heck of a fighter when I made it to NHL.   So John would take care of the pest.  If they would not fight.   I would usually grab their tough guy...   And beat him up.   If we were playing flat and we did not have energy...   Or if it was a really bad hit I would just grab that guy and I would...   Beat his doors off.   It is funny through all my career I really hated fighting. There was days where I would not sleep at night just because I knew I was going to get into a fight but you just do your job. And Ithink I did my job well.  Well enough that John was able to make a career in the NHL.  It is everything you dream of as a kid.  It was kind of like a leap of faith and it worked out great.  So by this point Danielle and John had gotten married.  You know we had bought our first house.  Soon after had their first two kids.  It was just so beyond anything weor I ever expected.  Well tell me tell me all the names of all the teams that you played for.  Oh my gosh I am embarrassed. I so...  So in 2008 John started playing in the NHL for the Minnesota Wild. After that he played for Chicago and New York and Buffalo and San Jose. And and throughout his whole career as an enforcer there was this shift going on in professional hockey.   A lot of the hockey establishment and the media execs in the league we are pushing for the game to be more high scoring.   To be more about skill and speed.   A lot of people started coming out and saying there should not be a place in this league for fighting.  And I was the easy target.   They went after me. And they said Listen we do not need guys like this in a league.   Their sole purpose is to punch people.   And we are going to eliminate players like this.  Which is one of the reasons why...  Oh my God John Scott All-Star. Oh.  For guys like Greg Wyshynski and Jeff Merrick voting John Scott into the All-Star Game was not just a hilarious joke about a big guy who could not skate but it was also a big fat middle finger to the hockey establishment.  So I will I will just do the whole the the big point...  Do it. Do it.  I waswe were on the road and we were on the bus heading to a game or a pregame skate.  It was December 2015 John was playing for the Arizona Coyotes.  And a guy on my team Anders Lindback ourgoalie he was sitting beside me and he is like Hey you are you know you are in. It was like 56 plays or something you know of of the fan voting. And I was like Oh you know that is great. People think it is a joke. They are going to vote for me a little bit and it was it was nothing serious. So that is how I first heard of it on the bus. So we go to therink we do our skate. Literally after the skate he checks his phone again and he is like Holy cow man you are like top 25. It happened that fast and then the next day I was top five and then like the day after that I was number one.   So it is like a...   Mega story.   It was unbelievable how quickly it grew.    Which meant that John would be...   A team captain at the All-Star Game.   And for the fans who were voting for John there was definitely a bit of like Oh you shrunk the number of players we can vote in.  Oh Yeah Oh really. Well we are going to make our votes count then.  Here's Johnny. But I think for a majority of voters voting for John.  Let us be honest  It was just really simple.  The reason John Scott's leading the voting is because its funny.  John Scott is not an All-Star.  He has one goal over eight games. He barely plays...  Like in the three-on-three format where there were supposed to be a bunch of speed and skill. Would not it be funny to see this big   Arizona Coyote's goon.  ogre.  Fighter with no skills  Objectively bad at hockey   I do not know what he is doing in the league.  Make a fool of himself.  Oh I hated it. This is not funny anymore. I get it. Like I am this terrible player who you guys think it would be fun to watch me you know fail in this game. But I just figured it would end on its own. Honestly I thought it would last a few days and people would get you know the enough of it and it would go away. But it just did not.  And as for the NHL.  They were they were pissed . I mean to put it frankly. I definitely got the sense from some of the people that I speak to on a regular basis at the NHL that they were really angry that this was happening.  And why like c- c- can you get any more specific about like why this would have been an embarrassment to them? Like what is it exactly that they were so sensitive about?  They are sensitive about the fact that the All-Star Game is something that a lot of old-time hockey people and there is a lot of old-time hockey people that run the national hockey league see as something prestigious one of the ultimate honors for a player. And so this was not something they wanted to happen and it was happening and they did not really know what to do about it because they did not have any fail safes in place to prevent it from happening.  After one day of John Sitting on top of the All-Star vote.  We are just like lying in bed. The kids are sleeping...  John gets a text message. He gets out of bed goes over to his phone starts reading it and he is just standing there for like for like a while.  Selfishly I am just want to go to bed but then you know I can tell something's just got him stewing over there and it was hisPR guy from the Coyotes.  They they thought it would be a good idea to release a statement and they wrote up this statement for me and it basically said Thank you for the support. I do not want your votes. Please vote for other guys on my team.  Basically his own team is saying...  Step away from the All-Star Game.  I saw him like respond Yeah that statement's fine. And then delete it and then just sit there and look at it. And I just remember asking like Do you do would you want to go? And he is just like...  Well yeah I think because as a kid II watched all the All-Star Games. It was so fun to watch and II would dream to be in it.  yeah.  And I am like Well they want you to release the statement release the statement but make sure that it is true.  And so John ends up writing a statement that reads quote It is nice to be thought of by all of the fans. And for that I am truly flattered and grateful. And while I would love to experience an All-Star Game I think a few of my teammates are a bit more deserving of a vote. And so it is sort of like I would go if I get voted but there is other people who deserve it more.  I said Yeah sure. Send it out. I was not totally on board with it but I just wanted to appease thehigher ups to hopefully help them.  But even after that it was still John Scott number one vote getter.  Oh by far. Yeah. It is funny. They stopped showing how many votes the players were getting. They took that option off the website because I think I was ahead by so many.   It is like you broke the website.  Yeah. And so theytook that away. And then the NHL they really tried to strong arm me.  Oh yeah. What happened there?  So I was in my bedroom and Arizona and they called and it was one of the higher ups in NHL and he just you know wanted to know how I was feeling. It was getting really close to the end of the voting. I just said Yeah I I you know I I want to go to the game. I think it would be fun. I think it would be good for everybody involved. And he is like Really? Are you sure? Like You think you will be able to keep up? You think you are good enough? Like uh You are not exactly a skill guy John. And they started that way and I just kind of brushed it off you know I was like Ican skate pretty well. I am a good decent hockey player. And he goes Well you know what what do youhave you talked to your dad? What do you think... First he goes Are you is your dad alive? And I was like Yeah he is alive. Like What do you think he is going to think about this situation? You know you think you are going to make him proud? And I was like What! like I do not think that has anything to do with this.  And I kind of brushed that off and at this time I am getting a little angry because I am just like Man like it was Let me flip and play. And then he is like Well what do you think your kids are going to think when they look back on this? Do you think they are going to be proud of their dad who went into the All-Star Game this way? And as soon as he brought my kids into the equation I just like lost it and I kind of snapped back at him. I am like You are being a real bleep and bleep and bleep and bleep. And we went back and forth and he started cussing at me. And  and then like I finally like snapped back into like Holy cow. I am like yelling at one of the head guys in NHL. I should like dial it back and I apologized like Sorry. Like You you know you pushed the wrong the button. Like Let us talk tomorrow. I will let you know if I am going to go or not. Ileft it like that.  So John slept on it. Woke up the next day...  Called the the dude the next morning and I said I am going.  After the break. We will see you at the game.  Maybe we will.  Yeah maybe.  Maybe not.  Maybe not. Yeah.  Mmh.    Three two one Jad.  Robert.  Radiolab.  Back to hockey.  And reporter Latif Nasser.  Okay so about two weeks before the All-Star Game John is just getting ready for practice and the GM of the team comes up to him.  Been talking to me all the time throughout this All-Start stuff and I thought it was just going to be another conversation about that. And he pulls me into the stick room and he is like Yeah I am I just traded you to Montreal. And I was like Are you effing kidding me? What? And he is like Yeah it was a hockey move. We you know weneeded a little defensive help and we traded you to Montreal for this guy. And I said This is an effing joke are you kidding me? And he said Sorry. You know the deal's been done. I was like okay whatever super shady to be traded right after I am finally in the All-Star Game. It is like you know if it smells like ayou know walks like a duck talks like a duck. It is theit is fishy.  We called John's former team and the NHL about this. Neither wanted to talk. Nonetheless what happened next is that a short while later John is in the locker room...  Gathering my things trying to say goodbye to the guys and he pulls me aside again.  And the GM tells him Actually Montreal team we just traded you too. They are now going to demote you.  They are sending you to Saint John's Newfoundland their farm team.  You are in the minor leagues now.  Go through the trainer get your stuff ready you are leaving today.  According to the terms of the trade he had to be on the plane that same day.  And that is when I was just like I was done. I was like Okay I am done. See ya. And I just checked out. I went likefound somewhere in the rink. I called my wife...  Who by the way was nine months pregnant with twins.  I get the phone call from John. In those situations he is kind of a man of like few words.  He tells her we are in the minors now.  And I am like All right we will be fine. Plan C where is the minor team? Like How do I get there? You know? And he is like Yeah it is literally on the other side of the world.  It is North America's easternmost city.  Like you could not go further from where I am at right now and still be on this continent.   And I said Sorry I have got to go. Can you please handle all of this? Take my two kids take the two kids in your belly take all my stuff pack it up. Like I have to leave. It is so bizarre to have to say that to her and like there is nothing I could have done. You just say I am sorry I have to go.  And I was just thinking to myself Okay you know like just trying to hold on to hope like we could make this work. Let us see where it is at. And I am like looking at flights and like I pull up Kayak and I am seeing like the flights and it is like 16 hours of travel 14 hours of travel 18 hours of travel. And like the prices for like a ticket is like 1600. Like it set in. It really all hit me at that moment. And I just like sobbed.  I composed myself got my gear told the GM to go you know wherever. And I jumped in the car packed up my shit and went to St John's.  Youwant to talk about John Scott. So we need and have the debate.  No I guess so.  The floor is yours.  Quiet.  Canadian legend Don Sherry on the hit TV show Hockey Night in Canada.  Anyhow you jerks that put him up forto be in the All-Star Game. What is your done you you have taken this kid who was doing pretty good playing six minutes playing 12 minutes it did not matter in Arizona NHL contract. What you did was you are talking putting him in the minors now. Lots of funny. I bet you are very proud of yourself because the NHL this year is going to be terrific and you are goingyou tried to ruin it all and you ruined this kid he is in the minors never to come back. I bet you should be ashamed of yourself. You should be ashamed of yourself. That is it.  I saw this news hit and my first reaction was you have got to be kidding me.  Again. Greg Wyshynski who started the John Scott for All-Star campaign.  It was weird. Oh man that they just make this problem go away.  But was there part of you who was like Oh my God like Istarted this this is on me.  No because at that point you know there had been criticism of us for having this campaign and obviously when John Scott came out  I was like You guys ruined my career this sucks. And sort of poo-pooed off the bat made you feel like maybe you have done something kind of bad to a dude. But the campaign had kind of taken on a life of its own and at that point John Scott said he wanted to be an All-Star wanted to represent a certain type of player.  My role is like almost extinct. I am like the last of my kind out here and like it would be cool to go out with a bang.  All of his friends were saying you should do it. He wanted to do it because people are telling him not doing it  Right. No and and I mean it necessarily that you know that it is your fault or anything but in a way that like youjust and not that you could have foreseen it but like you started the train. Was there part of you that was like Oh my God. Like if I had not said that one thing on my podcast like this guy would not have had to uproot his whole life.  No I mean again like I I feel like it was the National Hockey League at this point that was standing in his way.  Now whatever you think about the initial prank or John being demoted this is the moment Greg says when the crowd mood totally shifted.  Complete outrage.  This is trash  Like complete outrage.  This is garbage. I am not going to go about it on a rant about democracy.  It became protests online.  This is a lousy thing to do.  Sweeping through the hockey world. Like look the fans voted this guy in the NHL is doing all it can to keep this guy out and that is not right.  You want to change this contact your favorite sports writer in your city. Since the NHL is so damn image-conscious why do not you put pressure on your favorite reporter to stick up for John Scott? I can only imagine how John feels right now.  Well pissed off. Sorry for yourself. Then you feelyou get sad. Do I even want to play hockey? Do I even want to dolike Ido I just quit hockey and go work? Likeyou think about all these things.  But now that you are in the minor leagues are you allowed to play for the All-Star Game?  That is the thing. No one knew.   He says right after he was demoted to the minor league.  People started to you know read through the bylaws read through the books.  Trying to figure out like can a minor league player play in the Professional NHL All-Star Game. And it turns out...  There was no rule.  That even remotely addressed the situation. Like it was totally unprecedented.  And so the pressure stayed on the NHL knew that if John Scott was not in the All-Star Game there is probably visions from the NHL of protest signs along the glass...  Oh wow.  Of fans out the outside the arena holding a rally because John Scott was snubbed.  And according to Greg hockey fans are notorious for throwing jerseys onto the ice in protest causing scenes...  Andeventually the National Hockey League had to acquiesce. They put out a statement. They made a statement saying hey if John wants to go he can go.  But John says at this point  I told everybody I am not going. Like the  all my friends the teammates I am like I am done. Like this is a boguslike I do not want to do this.  He says between the fans making fun of him and the League demoting him the whole thing was just too humiliating.  But I was just like John you may regret this. I know you want to like run away and hide right now and like going in front of all these people is the very last thing you want to do but you might regret it.  She was like Let us go. It will be fun for the family. The kids will love it. I would love to see you go and prove these people wrong. My wife was building me back up and slowly but surely I was like Okay you know what? Fuck this. Let us do it.   January 31 2016.  Nashville was a complete circus. It was unbelievable. I was obviously the big story so the moment I landed there is reporters everywhere asking me questions.  John would be representing the Pacific Division in the All-Star Game.  And we had to play I think it was the central who everyone said they were stacked because they had all the stud players on their team.  Players like...   Matt Duchene.   James Neal all of these much younger much higher paid players. And then you hadJohn.  I knew everybody was staring at me and I am weird about my hair cause I am going bald and I am skating around like I wish I would have grabbed my hat. I was like Dang it.   Everything is buzzing.  Danielle's in the stands with their two little kids.  Everybody's looking for him to fail.  Yeah. This this dummy's going to make an ass of himself.  And before the game the coach comes up to him.  The coach asked me if I wanted to start and I just said No please let me stay on the bench.  And the coach is like All right but you are going in early. So John's teammates skate out to center ice. He is sitting on the bench butterflies in his stomach.   Ref drops the puck.   Right away 26 seconds into the game.   John's team goes down to 1 - 0.   It was it was like a terrific goal. Like it was a pass to a one-timer shot. Like it was a goal that All-Stars make. John's coach looks at him and says Scott you are in. Remember this is three-on-three. There is a ton of open eyes.  There is nowhere to go. Like there is nowhere to hide.  And John says that skating up to center ice. He just kept thinking Do not mess up. Do not mess up. Do not make a fool of yourself.  And that is all I was thinking about.  Ref's got the puck holds it above the center ice.  I do not belong here. They think you are a joke. Do not screw it up.  Drops it.  Once the puck drops you just kind of you knoweverything else goes away and you just start playing hockey. This was like going back to when I was younger. I was not the best. I was not the fastest but youyou know you just start playing. And that is what I did.  This time John's team took possession of the puck.   Burnsy had the puck. And we are going up the ice.  John and his teammates charge across center ice. They move into their opponent zone. When...   Brent Burns passes the puck to John. John manages to control it. He is kind of up against the board. So he is using his body to protect the puck trying to figure out what to do next.   When he makes his nice little backhand pass.   Burnsy had the puck on the right wing and all of a sudden I noticed  Between two of the defenders there is this nice little lane right to the net.  I went to the net.   Burns spotted John.  And he put the puck right on my stick.  John just like a few feet from goal and the goalie's actually out of position.  I had a wide open net and I shot it.   And I missed the net.  Like a like a wide open net.  But the goalie was luckily sliding back into position.  And so the puck hit the goalie bounced off the goalie and...   Into the back of the net.   It was awesome. Like I was so jacked up. I had goose bumps like after the goal. It was so neat. It was cool.  Everybody went nuts. That was the neat thing. The crowd I did not know how they were going to react. Usually they boo me because everybody booed me and theywere all for it.   The weird thing about the mass is too it is like how quickly everybody can go from hating you to loving you. It was such a sense of relief for me.  The huge monkey was lifted off my back because I was like Okay I did something for the team. I did not mess up.  He is going to relax and have fun just like be himself and play.  Which he did.   He laid out this guy Patrick Kane.   And then the two of them...   Dropped their glove...   Pretended to have a fight.   He got a couple of nice passes.   Had a really close shot on goal. He was just kind of doing everything.  And every time John Scott was on camera or touched the puck the crowd would come to life.  Greg Wyshynski was actually their reporting at the game and he was down in the tunnels interviewing other All-Stars.  And what happens when you are down in the bowels of the arena is that the All-Star Game's on TVs but there is a delay between what the broadcast has and what is happening on the ice. So typically you will hear something happen in the game before you actually watch it on TV. And I remember hearing this gigantic roar from the crowd and then everybody kind of looked over at the TV and watched the All-Star Game.   So what happened what elicited that roar was that it was getting to the end of the game tight game. John's team was up by one.  We were in our zone playing defense and all of a sudden...   Their team shot it.   We had a save and Burnsy got the puck behind the net.   And I just blew the zone. I skated to the zone as fast as I could because I knew he was going to get it. He saw me up the middle and he...   Fired a nice pass and I corralled it and took off down the center of the ice.   If I had someone hounding me  But Johns so big he was able to keep this defender off of them. So it was just John the goalie and the net. He gathered the puck.  I ripped the shot top corner on the goalie.   And it went in.    It was amazing.  No goalie deflection no lucky bounds just a solid skill shot.  There was this sort of this moment of just laughter. Laughter from the players being waiting to be interviewed. Laughter from the media downstairs. Just unbridled joy and watching it all happen.  I was just like Is this even happening?    Like it started to just be like could I it is like I could physically see the smile on his face from up in the stands.  The guys on the ice jumped on me. They were like Holy cow this is unbelievable.  The final chapter of the John Scott story at least as it pertains to the All-Star Game is this really beautiful thing. And so so there is the scene in Star Trek  The Wrath of Khan     Where it looks like the Enterprise is going to get away having defeated Khan but Khan is still alive.   And he is going to try to trigger the doomsday device on his ship to kill everybody.   Okay.  And so ashe Enterprise is flying away you see a bloodied Khan say...   Hell's heart. I stab at thee.   And I thought of that scene when the voting for most valuable player at the All-Star Game starts.  To explain at the end of the game there is one final bit of fan voting. Fans are gonna choose the MVP of the NHL All-Star Game most valuable player. And the fans in the arena and watching on TV they would text the name of the person they want to a number or they would go on Twitter and use the special hashtag and type the person's name. Any case..   Right as the voting is about to begin the NHL puts up a bunch of names of players on the jumbotron. Says Here are your choices. And John Scott's name was not listed among the three MVP candidates on the jumbotron.   The fans saw that I was not on there and they went nuts they started to boo...  Loudly. Visibly you could you know feel it around the rink. I felt it was the last gasp of all the people at the NHL that tried to keep John Scott out of the All-Star Game. It was their last chance to get him.  Like Khan trying to get Captain Kirk that is what he was trying to say with the analogy. Anyway what ended up happening is that during the voting thousands of people wrote in their own choice and when it was announced...   It is funny I did not hear it because on ice level you do not hear what the speakers are playing because they point the speakers to the fans. So I did nothear it until like somebody who is like Hey like go and like get your trophy. And I was like Oh oh weird.  John skates out to the center of the ice laughing looking a little scared.  Holy Shit. I was just like the MVP of the All-Star Game.     And in what was the teary-eyed Disney family sports film moment...    He was hoisted onto the shoulders of his teammates and paraded around like he was a Rudy.  Greatest sports movie ever.  I wanted to go down by the ice so that the kids could see John and people were trying to help me down the stairs and like parting the seas so I could get down there.  Mykids were down at the bench with my wife and it was so weird like it was literally like Disney wrote a script and it is like Okay now he kisses his wife.  He kissed me and our eyes locked and it was just we both were kind of like shaking our heads like wewere at both a bit speechless.  Now he grabbed his kids.  He scooped them up.  In this clich fashion I grabbed my kids and skated on the ice.  It was like Daddy you stink. You smell bad. And like every time like I would just look at him and I am like Can you even believe this is happening? And it was No like I just cannot.  And as they came off the ice there were crowds of people waiting to ask them questions take pictures with them.  But we had a flight the next morning at like 00 AM.  He had to get back to the minor leagues. And before that they still had to have these babies. So they rush home to give birth to the twins.  Four days after the babies were born I went back to St John's.  Oh my God.  Yeah.  I feel like that was really the beginning of the rest of our lives.  John finished out that season played one last NHL game and then retired. He and Danielle live with their five girls in Traverse City Michigan. But the legacy of his All-Star appearance lives on in two ways. First the day after the game it was announced that John Scott's helmet the helmet he wore during the game would be flown to Toronto where it will be put on display at the Hockey Hall of Fame. But the other thing that happened with just in time for the next year's All-Star Game the NHL created a new rule known as the John Scott rule which states that any player who is voted to be a captain in the All-Star Game then gets demoted to the minor leagues will be disqualified will not be allowed to play. Effectively ensuring that never again will the fans have quite the power to overthrow the system and vote in a John Scott.  Reporter Latif Nasser.
