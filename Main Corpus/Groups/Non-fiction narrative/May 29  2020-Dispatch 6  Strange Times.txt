    Hey it is Jad. Radiolab. This is dispatch number six.   Okay. Calling. I am initiating the call.   Okay.     Hi can I speak to Mark please?   This is he. Hello hello.   Hi Mark. This is Jad. And I am also here with Molly from -- from Radiolab.   Hi Mark.   Molly nice to meet you.   Hi.   Thanks for taking the time. We are ...   Okay as I mentioned last week we have all been thinking about time these days. And in this dispatch two completely unexpected time wormholes that I fell into while reporting about the coronavirus. And just trying to get through this great pause that we are all in. The first -- first wormhole deals with a guy as much as anyone has really helped us understand the enemy that we are up against. His name is Mark Denison he works at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville Tennessee.   Well all right. Thank you again for making the time. It is super appreciated.   Yeah.   So yeah you know we just want to ask you some questions about your background questions about the drug. I got Molly to come on because Molly is much smarter about these kinds of topic areas than I am and she is been following your work as well. So I guess ...   Well it is just those words alone We have been following your work. Are like words I just have never heard before.   You are having like a bit of a rock star moment yeah?   Yeah. Well it is not my goal. Definitely not my goal. But ...   Yeah.   You know it has been a -- it has been a sort of a little bit of a down the rabbit hole through the looking glass that sort of experience.   What makes the moment so looking glass-y for Mark is that he is been studying coronaviruses for 30 years. This thing that we have all just woken up to which is actually a very ancient virus by the way his lab has been studying it for three decades which in human corona time feels like an epoch. His lab was the one that figured out one of the really novel parts of the coronavirus family which is that they have got a built-in fact-checker that allows them to fact-check the copies that they make of themselves as they get made which is what has allowed them to grow big and become complex. His lab figured that out in 2007. Seven years ago they figured out how to trick that fact-checker and disrupt the virus's ability to make copies of itself which has led to a drug ...     ... you have probably heard of.                 Remdesivir in preliminary data has been found to shorten recovery times from COVID.     Under certain circumstances it shortened hospital stays by up to four days.     I have studied it for seven years. I know it is really good at killing coronaviruses. In every coronavirus we have tested in every animal we have tested every aspect of this says this is good this is good this is good.   But he says right now the drug ...   It is an IV drug and so it can only be given to people in the hospital.   You have to be in the hospital to get it. And if that is the case you are probably already sick. So we started talking about all this and it quickly became clear that this guy who is been studying this ancient virus for 30 years it is like he is been plucked out of obscurity and his sense of time has had to radically change. All of a sudden he is under a lot of pressure people are pushing for results. His lab at Vanderbilt was one of the few facilities in the world that can work with the virus so he is fielding calls from dozens and dozens of scientists and companies who are like Hey I have got this compound. Can you test it against the virus? I have got a potential vaccine. We need your help running this experiment 'ecause we do not know how to do it.   You know yes we feel the pressure.   It is like the world is suddenly asking him to go way faster than he thinks he can go.   I understand this is very different. This is outside of any scope of anything any of us have ever experienced in our lives. But a couple things. One is -- is I have sort of been telling my people over and over again this is too urgent to go fast.   Why would not you say it is so urgent that we have to go fast?   No I mean for multiple reasons.   For one he says just there is some basic limits. Like if you are experimenting with the virus in the lab you have got to grow it in the lab and that takes time.   You know it takes two days or three days in culture to grow. If you are testing it with a drug it may take longer you know? The What have you done today? is -- is really it has to be What have you done this week and this month? Which is sort of counter to the -- the speed the need for speed. And I just -- I just tell people that I will never make them accelerate their work to match a deadline that the virus biology will not allow. Yeah so you are not just kind of going in and doing experiments.   But then we start talking more about the lab itself the BSL-3 biosafety level 3 lab which he runs at Vanderbilt University. This is where they do the experiments on these dangerous pathogens. It took him two years to just set up the lab to begin with because it is got to be built in exactly the right way with the right air condition units that always suck air in a certain direction and the right rooms within rooms within rooms to make sure everything is always contained inside. It is one of the most regulated places on Earth. And he says when you are in that kind of space it forces you into a completely different time-flow.   Work at BSL-3 is hyper-methodical. You do one thing at a time. Like you take a flask and if you open the -- you open -- you do not do anything with your hip or your elbow or your other hand or your head. You know you do everything with an intentionality that is very -- it is sort of anti really how we train to kind of move forward fast and do lots of things in a day. You take a flask out you move it to the incubator you set it down you go back and you close the incubator. Everything is written down. You follow the guidelines you follow them one step at a time. Your phones -- you cannot answer a phone. You cannot respond to an email. The world sort of comes to a stop while you are working in there.   And you have to do that because it is so dangerous?   Yeah. No one can tell you to speed up when you are in the BSL-3.   You said about eight inches from my mouth right? Should I just hold it like that?   No one can tell you go fast.   Maybe just a little closer to your mouth?   Okay.   There was something about the way Mark talked about the BSL-3 the way people have to move and operate in that place that made me want to talk to someone from his lab who worked there.   My first name is Andrea. My last name is Dutch. It is Prousers which nobody can pronounce here. My husband always says Trousers with a P instead of a T.' So Prousers.   And what do you do at the lab?   I direct the coronavirus antiviral research program.   What is an average day like? Can you walk us through it?   Yeah. Yeah. So first of all we usually -- we prepare a lot outside the room because everything that goes into the room can never come out. I leave a note on my door that I am going to the BSL-3 and what time I am going there because if I am not back in about six hours somebody needs to come check on me.   All right it is Monday morning. I am walking to the BSL-3.   Walk down the hall with our cart.   I got my stuff loaded onto a cart.   With our supplies.   Spent most of the morning making the dilutions this drug that I am testing against SARS COVID-2. And I am ready now.   Do you ever get scared of the viruses you work with?   When we got that shipment of SARS COVID-2 so the current coronavirus from the CDC I did shake a little bit opening that box. You know it was -- it was a big deal. When I approached -- I cannot really go into too much details.   I am here now.   Cannot tell you where the BSL-3 is because it is about a security issue.   Does your husband know where it is?   He does not. No absolutely not. He does not need to know.   Letting myself in. Now I am in the ante room which is where I get dressed and put on my PPE.   And so in the ante room we take street clothes off cover ourself in Tyvek head-to-toe.   I am putting on gloves.   We wear two pairs of gloves.   Second pair of gloves. And then I am going to put on my clapper which is my respirator. Turning it on now.   Wow you are totally enclosed.   Which I like.   This is the sign that it is working correctly.   I feel kind of like an astronaut when all that is said and done. So then once I am all suited up ...   Now I am ready to go in.   I -- I let myself in and then -- and then I start my work. I set up my workspace.   All right I am gonna take the blowers out of the freezer right now. This is SARS COVID-2. It is in a small tube.   I check if there are any lights flashing. I need to be aware of everything that goes on around me because we have redundant safety mechanisms but if they are failing I need to know about that.   And I am going to put it in the micro-centrifuge the centrifuges for a little bit.   It is very important that you are always aware of where you are. Is there somebody behind me? Is there someone next to me? Who might I potentially bump into?   All right. So that is the sound of the micro-centrifuge being done. I am going to take it out now and set up my assay. I am gonna dilute the virus further.   You move your head you look around you are always aware of where you are whose path you might be blocking. We are bigger than we normally are because we wear all that equipment.   Oh yeah.   All right I have infected these cells with virus now and now I am gonna let it incubate for about half an hour.   Always know where your hands are. Every time you touch a tube there might be a little bit of virus on our gloves so we always have to be aware of what we touch and what order we touch it in.   All right. Now I am going to qualify the number of infectious viral particles in a mixture.   So whenever we open a tube of virus it is inside of our safety cabinet you draw up some volume you put the volume in the next tube that is already open because I do not want to have to worry about having the liquid in my pipette tip and then have to open the tube because it could create aerosols. We are very concerned about aerosols which are tiny little droplets that could land on other things and they could contaminate other things.   Wow!   So we put it in the tube and then we move it kind of in the same line in the same direction.   Basically what I am doing here is looking at a dense sheets of cells.   Andrea says just to be allowed to walk in the room it takes six months of training.   We have all kinds of protocols for everything. Everything is very protocol-driven.   To learn all the rules ...   How to move ...   ... how to do things in a precise order.   One thing at a time methodically.   At first she says it is kind of stressful but then a funny thing happens. There comes a point where the thoughts in your mind just settle.   It is -- it is kind of a place of zen. Because you are focused you are alert I am just in the now. My heart rate lowers. I do not have many thoughts. In fact it is not a good idea to think about other things. The only thing I can do is -- is listen to the music and the music is sometimes inspiring me to kind of bob my head a little bit without moving my hands involuntarily of course.   In the zen space do you -- I am wondering what your relationship with time is?   It is funny because the clocks in there keep dying. I think it is something about the -- the airflow and the battery keeps corroding. So ...   Oh my God time does not work in there!      Sorry? What?   Time does not work in the BSL-3.   Yeah exactly. I do lose time. You have to really find your zen space. I say that because when you are in a respirator with your head and there is an eyelash that falls in your eye there is nothing you can do about it.   Oh wow!   Or there is a lock of hair just poking in your eye every -- every few seconds.   What do you do in that situation?   I think it is a Buddhist principle kind of acknowledge it. I just tell myself Yeah this is really annoying. There is nothing I can do about it. So I will just focus on my work.   It is a profound profound mindfulness.   It is funny because I was saying to Jad at one point. I was like it is like we have -- when you started describing the lab earlier in the conversation it reminded me of this feeling that I have had of like it feels like coronavirus has asked us all to be very present.   Yeah.   Like there is really no future.   Yeah.   That we are planning for.   Yeah.   The way Mark puts it coronavirus has its own time. It is ancient. It is been around for millions of years circulating in bats now it is in us. And how we feel about that whether we think the pandemic is over and we can all go back to our lives or whether we think it is only the end of the first part or whatever does not really matter because it is got its own time.   This gets to kind of a -- it feels almost like an existential kind of a thing as well right? So viruses do not care and if I was going to have a title of an article it is that I do not care. Virus I do not care. I do not care at all. And I do not have thoughts I do not have feelings. You can project them on me if you want to but all I do is find another host and I get into their cells and I replicate. Let us say there is even -- there is even a half a billion people that have been infected let us really project out. Well there is you know 7.2 who have not been. This is a brand new virus in humans. This virus has never been humans before. I can anthropomorphize again thinking about it. Okay well I can go here. I can go in this tissue. Oh I am doing anthropomorphism again. The virus is exploring it and what it is telling us it is telling us about the difference in children and adults. It is telling us about the difference between pretty old people to really old people. It is telling us about our immune system. But outside the virology it is also telling us about the fragility of the global organism of humans being our political and economic and social financial cultural systems and habits that those are all being probed by the virus as well. And we are learning about how the -- how we are all interweaved and interleaved because it is breaking each of those parts and making us view them individually.   You know what is weird? It just occurred to me. Like there is been this inversion. We are now living in the place where you work every day.   Yes.    We are all living in the BSL-3 basically.   Without protection.     Let me reiterate without protection.   Without protection.   Coming up one more time wormhole totally different situation totally different location. That is after the break.   Science reporting on Radiolab is supported in part by Science Sandbox a Simons Foundation initiative dedicated to engaging everyone with the process of science.   Im Jad Abumrad this is Radiolab. Were back. Okay BSL-3 time we did that. Now for the second chapter Cow Time. Some context so this began in conversation with Molly Molly Webster she had been thinking a lot about all of these ideas and was sort of rolling them around.   Ive just had so many conversations with people about time in this moment. And like everyone trying to I do not know understand it or grapple with it. Or like somehow face it down in a way that they never have before. Like I can only describe it as like a slipperiness like you cant quite hold on.   Mm-hmm.   As we were talking ...   Can I tell you where my mind goes?   Yeah.   I told her a story about something that had just happened a couple days before.   Okay so my family and I went to this farm thats not too far from where were staying right now.   Mm-hmm.   Because all the parks were closed there was nothing to do with the kids. So a friend of ours was like Oh I know somebody who owns a farm. Its very close to you.   Mm-hmm.   You should just go there and walk around. Shed be totally cool with it.   Henry the hawk?   Yeah.   Jeff?  Jeff the hawk.   So the four of us went there.   Great moos!   I should say this was in Lebanon Tennessee appropriately enough. Huge farm. Cows goats donkeys sheeps theyre all kinda milling around. No fences. And ...   Yeah thats a good question Amil.   I was walking next to Amil my 10 year old.   If time is actually frozen how come it doesnt feel frozen to us?   And he was asking all these questions about spacetime.   Heres another question.   Yeah.   If time truly is a hologram ...   I think he had just watched a PBS show about this.   Holograms can rewind themselves.   True.   How come ...   He was like Why does time only go in one direction? Does time ever end? It felt like he was processing some stuff about this moment maybe. So I just asked him.   Hey I have a more ordinary question for you.   Sure.   How has time felt over this pause or whatever we call it where we had to go and start staying at home and move to Nashville and stuff? Has it felt like its gone faster has it felt like its gone slower? Or does it feel normal?   It feels like -- hmm. Hold on I have to think this through. Well like when were at home were really used to there. So like time goes fast for us because like were used to at home. But like when were here time goes slower basically because like we dont know this place at all.   Interesting. Yeah I think youre right.   He said that?   Yeah.   Wow. Profound little bugger.   As soon as we got to Nashville ...   Yeah.   So he kept riffing on this as we walked across this open meadow past a whole group of donkeys. Past some sheep. And then we got through the clearing and entered these woods which stretched for about two miles behind the farm.   Well dragonflies eat the mosquitoes I think.   Yeah they do.   Whatever eats mosquitoes is a friend of mine.   Frogs.   Go frogs!   And spiders.   Love the spiders.   So were about quarter mile into the woods I think. When ...   I do love -- ooh wow! Check this out.   Whoa.   Whoa. Its like a whole ...   When right there on the ground was this very big very dead cow. Just a skeleton but ...   Oh my God!   Completely intact.   Hmm.   Thats cool.   Yeah. Wow.   The skeleton was on its back legs pointed up. Birds hadnt scattered the bones but the ants had cleaned it so there was no flesh.   Thats a cow right?   That is definitely a cow.   Huh.   We just stood there and looked down at it.   Its funny you know its like your jido broke five of his ribs look at how many ribs they have.   They have a million.   Then we noticed that next to the big cow skeleton ...   Oh my God. A little baby skull. A baby cow.   Can I have it?   Well I dont think your mom would like it if you took that. Its so cool though. Wow!   You could take a picture of it.   What do you think happened to that little baby?   I dont know. Hold on lemme turn it over. Oh wow.   Oh my God its tiny. Poor thing.   So we were like what happened here? Was there some kind of birth that didnt go right?   He looks creepy though.   Yeah.   Like his eye socket.   But what was interesting was that he kept coming back to this question of like ...   Is that even a cow?   Yeah.   Are we sure thats a cow? Because you know skeletons all look alike.   Its funny though but have you ever seen a human skull?   Oh Ive seen that. Those are the weirdest thing Ive seen.   They dont look that different do they?   Well a cows skull is more like imagine like a human but like the head would go down and then they bring the mouth forward and ...   We started talking about design. Like if you take a human skull smush it pull the mouth out slope the nose? Cow. Which caused him to ask -- and I didnt record this part unfortunately -- Why are they so similar? Heres where you start to get to the time bit. Because I started trying to tell him about this idea that Id read about 15 years ago one of my favorite ideas ever.   It looks like thats working. I think -- I wanna see that its rolling. Im getting a meter but why is it not -- oh no no. Were rolling.   I learned about this idea from a guy named Sean Carroll biologist.   I am Sean B. Carroll Professor of Biology at the University of Maryland.   Okay so Sean wrote a book about 15 years ago called Endless Forms Most Beautiful. Incredible book. And in that book he tells the story of some research that he was involved in. Back in the 1980s ...   1983 1984.   He and his colleagues were working with some fruit flies and they discovered these genes.   We discovered these genes because messing with them essentially inducing mutations in them had such spectacular effects. For example ...   Theyd mess with one gene. Just one gene.   Legs would appear on top of the head. Or an extra pair of wings would form. And if out of 17000 fruit fly genes one mutation can eliminate an eye or one mutation can put legs where antennae used to be you can imagine geneticists said What the heck is that gene? Lets go find out.   What they would eventually determine is that there were certain genes within the fly that acted as kind of master builders. Each one would turn on a whole bunch of other genes and the end result would be a limb. Or a wing. Or an antenna. A whole body part. Which was cool. But it was just flies.   But within a year a couple teams of biologists discovered that these genes existed not only in fruit flies but in almost every other kind of animal.   Worms whales elephants stick-bugs mice.   Humans.   All of these different creatures seemed to have the same set the same master toolkit of these little genes.   That represents about 500-million years of animal evolution. And to see those genes pretty much in similar arrangements to each other across the animal kingdom blew everyones mind.   Yeah.   Everyones mind. I dont know anyone who could have claimed they saw that coming. Weve learned from looking at creatures from the outside. We look at their anatomy and we say Okay this is a mouse over here an elephant over here a fly here a worm. Externally they just look you know incredibly different. But to find out that there are genes building those bodies that they all have in common was a stunning discovery.   And the reason we all have these master toolkit genes thats because we all came from the same creature way back in the beginning.   Right.   And these genes have been preserved.   Right.   And how do you wrap your mind around that? That the thing that builds the butterfly wing could be the same thing that builds my finger.   Well I think you just start from the observation that you and I and a lot of other animals are built of repeating parts.   Wait wait. I think all of these are ribs too.   Your rib cage with all the different kind of ribs.   These right here? One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen.   Your fingers your digits ...   Why are our fingers different lengths?   That is a very good question Tej.   ... which are slightly different variations on the same theme. Your toes are the same sort of way.   We could collect a hoof.   You wanna take a hoof?   I wonder what it would be like having hoofs and no fingers.   Your spinal column with the vertebrae where theyre you know slightly different from your neck down to your lower back. Whatd be great was to have a snake skeleton right next to that cow because there youd see maybe two or three hundred vertebrae with ribs coming off of them right? If it was a good-sized snake. And you understand Oh okay so that snake is mostly a little head and a little tail with all of these ribs. You can build you know so many variations on the same theme.   So youre saying one way to understand why so many different creatures can be made with so few genes that we all share is that were all basically made of legos.   Thats right. Thats right.   It also makes sense why animals have basically the same parts of bodies -- they have the same body parts as us.   It -- God its such a crazy idea. So okay heres ...   It is! Its a crazy idea. But if you just kind of frame the question a different way which is if these bodybuilding genes are so similar how do you make different kinds of animals? And thats where a lot of the research then turned.   And the picture that started to emerge is that if so many creatures share the same set of master genes well its obviously about how those genes are used.   When you turn them on how long they stay on when you turn them off.   And tempo. For example if you have a gene that makes the repeating segments of a spinal column in humans and it is the same gene that does that in a giraffe well in a human there will be a switch that goes like this on ... off. But in the giraffe it goes like this on ......... off. In other words one of the big differences that explains the diversity of animals on this planet -- and this is what we talked about in front of that cow -- is time these simple differences in time.   What are they called?   Theyre called hox genes.   Yeah the hox genes so the hox genes can -- I guess you could say they separate animals by their rhythms.   Yeah.   I mean it does not really separate them because then we wouldnt be able to see these animals. I guess the way they construct us is all about rhythm.   Yeah its all about timing and rhythm right?   Mm-hmm.   I think thats one of the coolest ideas Ive ever heard. Dont you?   Yeah. For some reason its more understandable than spacetime.   Yeah for sure. Spacetime I dont think Ill ever wrap my head around that.   I mean like seriously.   Okay. Lets get going.   I wish I got to keep one of the bones.   Yeah.   They are cool.   Like there is something so interesting to think about how little changes of time create totally different endpoints.   Yeah.   You know so like a moment of time created a cow. The same thing with a different moment of time created a Jad. The same thing with a different moment of time created a tadpole. And then so youre like What does this change in time -- like what will it create?   Yeah.   Yeah how -- how will this moment of time essentially pressure humans to evolve in a different way?   Yeah.   The planets would be dead by now.   Do you see how its changed out here guys? And now its like more orange and yellow?   Yeah.   Than it was just not even that long ago?   Do you think those cows will let us come close?   Theyre not supposed to hurt anyone.   Were so human-centric that you just suddenly think I wonder what time was like for that cow and its calf?   Oh my God totally! And I remember we had to cross a creek to get back to our car. And about 20 cows live cows were in the creek. These were I guess the cousins of the cow that we had met. The former cow.   Dad I waved to the cows.   Yeah? Oh look theyre looking at us. Hey buddies. Buddies and ladies.   And they were all just kind of hanging out. They were looking at us and chewing really slowly.      And I remember being struck by just how slow they were chewing. And I just thought Oh the worlds gonna keep going. Cows gonna keep chewing its grass. Flowers are gonna keep blooming the rivers are gonna keep flowing. Theres a different arc to all of this. Something about time on a farm makes you think those thoughts.   Oh!   Karla when did time switch from slow to fast for you?   What do you mean?   You know how when we started -- when we got here and time was so weird. And it was ...   Its the same for me I guess.   It still feels that way?   Yes. It hasnt changed.   Huh.   I do feel like weve been here a long time though. Or like our house feels far away.   Yeah.   But I think because Im with my family Im with you guys it feels like theres a normalcy a comfort.   Yeah.   A big thanks to Amil and Tej and Karla for being that through line that runs through everything. Big thanks to my dad same reason. To Molly Webster whose thoughts inspired this episode and who helped me move through it. And Tracie Hunte for the production assist and Soren Wheeler for yet one more late night push in a string of late nights that has gone back a decade. I am Jad Abumrad. Thanks for listening.
