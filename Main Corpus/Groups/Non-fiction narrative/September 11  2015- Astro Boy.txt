 OK so I understand lots of kids want to be astronauts. It is like the top three or four things to do and I get that. But I really wanted to be an astronaut. More than that I intended to be an astronaut. I found out in fact in second grade that most astronauts were pulled from the ranks of Air Force and Navy test pilots and test pilots do not have very long life expectancies.   So I started studying flight crash escape scenarios. I read star charts built telescopes studied exploration theory. They had fitness regimes. I drank Tang slept with high lines - have spacesuit will travel - under my pillow at night to prepare myself for the call because these guys were supermen so I had become one too. And I tried - Lord knows I tried. But certain things - physics the calculus the chemistry they did not come easy to me. And I do not know when I decided I did not measure up but I just felt like it was not working. I could not be one of those guys. So I started looking for a backdoor holes in the system. Maybe they will need somebody like me someday. I would not say it out loud but somewhere in the back my head I figured it could still happen. The phone could still ring. A couple weeks ago I went camping on a trail and at night looked up at the sky and it was ablaze. And I imagined 7-year-old me that little kid reading Encyclopaedia Britannica about rocket ships with the flashlight - that kid looking up at the grown man I have become and I wonder if that kid would be pissed.
