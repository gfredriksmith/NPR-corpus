   Your voice. And individual singing style.    I am Simon Adler. This is Mixtape a mini-series about how the cassette tape changed the world.   Gotta admit growing up cassettes were not a huge part of my family's life. But   My family did have a giant VHS camcorder. Massive.   My mom carried it around everywhere.        So we ended up with a pile of tapes.   And years later she asked me to digitize those tapes and I decided to make sort of like a one-hour highlight reel of our family. And I remember there was this moment where the weight of that hit me. Like huh. Like what do I put on this? Like which vacations? Theres my familys road trip down to Alabama which has my brother coming of age so it would be good to get him in there. But I do not know. Telemark Wisconsin in 1991 just captures a more vibrant version of my parents. Speaking of my parents like my mom did all the filming so how was I gonna get her in front of the camera? And like my dad he got sicker over the years. Do I do show his body changing or just kind of skip over that?   These are not earth-shattering questions. Very ordinary actually. But it just made me think a lot about like what version of the past is true? Because I knew that no one was gonna go back and watch the original raw tapes so any choice that I made on the highlight reel that was just going to become the de facto version of my family's history which gave me pause.   Okay so why am I telling you this? Well it turns out that this trap I would found myself in that we are all living in all the time I would argueit was created unintentionally by one man. A man who oddly enough you can hear singing in the background of many of my family movies.  Jingle bells. Jingle all the way.     That song in the background.  What fun to ride and sing in a one-horse open sleigh.  That guy right there.  Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way.  Mr. Bing Crosby.  Oh bring us some figgy pudding oh bring us some figgy pudding.  The voice of Christmas.  Oh bring us some figgy pudding and bring it out here.  Now I like Bing Crosby but whether you do or do not we are all living in his world the world that he created with a magical device and America's worst enemy.   But just for context in case you dont know who Bing Crosby is ...  One two  I mean it is very hard to think of a bigger star.  Collegiate collegiate. Yes we are!  This is historian Mark Clark.  And think Michael Jackson plus George Clooney.   On the road  Imagine one guy being the best-selling recording artist   The enchantment of Paris  The number one movie star ...    And the highest-rated show on radio.  And this is archivist Robert Bader.  Wonderful  There is nobody who could compare today.  Marvelous  I mean according to one source in 1948 if you turned on the radio there was a 50 percent chance you would hear Bing.  It is amazing!  Vaya con Dios  Half the songs on the radio were him.  So who is the king of all media? It is Bing Crosby.   So that is the backdrop. Our specific story begins with his weekly radio show.   The Kraft Music Hall.   Imagine you imagining the two who love me. And starting on the family tree.  Okay. And Kraft Music Show is that the same Kraft as Kraft macaroni and cheese?  That is right.   Okay.  Kraft sponsored the whole thing.  And so here's theand so this is a live show.  All through the day ...  He sings he interacts with people.  You know when we stop to think that in every corner of    They would do comedy skits.       Long story short this was a massively popular show.  Fifty million people a week we are tuning into the Kraft Music Hall. Fifty million people in the '30s and '40s is a stunning stunning percentage of the population.  More than a third of America.  It isit is just a crazy number to think about.  But here was the big problem while the audience was happy and NBC who was broadcasting his show was definitely happy. Bing was not.   His whole life was just wrapped around always working.  He had to perform two live radio shows a week act in all these movies ...   And on top of that he is also got other stuff going on.  Like a family.   Hang on. Check if you want to switch to a different microphone. I do.  Okay click that.  Okay I am clicking it.  Okay can you hear us?  Can I what?  You can hear us?  Oh I now hear you. Ah!  This is Mary Crosby who is a celebrity in her own right. But for the purpose of this story is Bing's daughter from his second marriage.  Okay.  How old was yourwas your dad when you were born?  I think he was like 54.  Long after the Kraft Music Hall.   Yeah. And he was semi-retired when we came along. So I was fortunate enough to actually have him be just Dad. He taught me how to hunt and fish and play baseball and ride horses. And he used to sing little songs. He would take songs and then makerewrite lyrics to them.  Down in the lob-lolly man its sure golly ...  And then sing them at the dining room table.  Like this never before released parody about a bird hunt he went on.  Bubba beg your partner cus we didnt get our limit but who gives a damn  So we were a very connected family. It was not big Hollywood parties and none of that. When those pointers get the sent then youre in the main event! Shooting quail in Sedgefield Alabama! Yes man.  But back when he was doing the Kraft show ...  What I know about his first family is that they had a very different life because he was working non-stop.  So he wanted to scale that back and he wanted to try and be better for his kids for his personal life.  And so he decided the simplest and easiest way to do that was just pre-record the Kraft Radio Show. That way hed only have to perform it once not twice once for each coast. And because it wouldnt be live the pressure would be way down.  Something like that.  Got it. Okay and like Bing walks into I do not know the corner office in LA where the head of NBC Studios is and says Dude I need to be able to record this. What does the NBC exec say back to him?  Well if you want to know the truth then it is much less dramatic. Bing did not go have that conversation he sent his lawyer.   Fair enough. What did they say back to the suit representing Bing?   They all look at him like he is crazy. You cannot not go on the radio live. You are Bing Crosby. You have to be there live.  At this point pretty much all radio was live. Almost nobody pre-taped. Or I should say pre-recorded to vinyl or shellac records.  Remember this was back in the days of 78 RPM.   And so the sound quality was not as good as a live performance.  Oh listen to the tale of the stalwart male who lost his well-known nanny.  I mean here's a recording on a 16-inch transcription disc the type they would have been using at the time.   So much that his handicap stayed at 30.  You would hear clicks and pops.  And now here ...  The same when she starts on her travels. Lazily flows from her...  Is what Bing would have sounded like live.  Slowly her length she unravels  I mean it is just better. It sounds like Bing is right in front of you.  Deep in the country shell tarry not knowing which way to go  Whispering sweet nothings into your ear.  Til the enchantment of Paris  And so NBC was freaked out.  It was this fear that if they record these shows nobody would listen.  And so the network simply saidNBC simply says No we are not going to do that.   So Kraft said no and Dad was totally frustrated. He walked out of the NBC show over the recording dispute.  Took his talent and relocated to this small scrappy media start-up ABC.  ABC was perfectly happy to have Bing Crosby pre-recorded. They were just perfectly happy to get any stars on that network at that time.    It was the exact same show.    Only difference was it was pre-recorded. But when it aired ...  The ratings are considerably less and they go down during the season. And interviewing people the sort of Nielsen ratings at the time said you know the sound     Just does nothe just does not sound as good.    He sounded far away.  This was a problem.  After youve gone and left me crying  And this could have been the beginning of the end.  After you go theres no denying  But then Bing gets a lucky break courtesy of ...   America's greatest enemy.   And ...   One of its greatest audio engineers.       This is Jack Mullin. He was an audio engineer. And this is him speaking to a room full of audio engineers back in the 1980s.   In 1943 as he explained to the room ...   During World War II he was stationed in the UK working for the signal corps.   Doing some kind of technical work involving radio transmissions.   One day he is soldering some cables or something and he is listening to the radio.   The thing was is that ...   The BBC went off the air ...   At midnight. Andand he and his colleagues they wanted to continue to listen and so what he would do is he would tune through the dial.   Lots of classical music.   And he says he was always amazed at just how clear the sound was.  This was a real puzzle.   They sounded live.  But we found out later of course what it was.   Fast forward two years the Allies are slowly marching across Europe and Jack is there with them. When they took a new town hed sweep in and collect whatever machinery or devices the Nazis had left behind.   And one day just outside of Frankfurt Jack bumps into this British officer who is all excited about this tape recorder he is just seen.   Because again Jack was an engineer. He knew that tape recorders sounded terrible.   Says Cheerio hops in his Jeep.   Those late-night German radio broadcasts were ringing in his ears.   So he ends up at this improvised radio studio.  Just a house really.  So he comes into this living room.   And he shows Jack thisthis big tape player. It was called a magnetophonon. And it looked like one of those reel-to-reel tape machines you see in studios sometimes. Did not look that different from other tape recorders he would seen.      He is utterly amazed at the quality of what he is hearing. He literally cannot distinguish it from a live performance.   And when the war finally ended...  He managed to get back to the United States with two of these machines.  Again Robert Bader.        And about 50 pieces of tape.   Now as for what made the magnetophone so good sounding it is a little bit technical but basically what the Nazi engineers had done was taken all the different advances in recording technology from around the world and put them into one box. For example theythey had something called AC bias where you insert super-high frequencies into recordings to smooth out the sound. They had these reliable motors for the reels which produced a more consistent sound. And Jack wanted to understand all this stuff.  So Mullin comes to Hollywood and he wants to get some research and development funds and really work this thing out. So the first place he went was the movie studios and he did some demos.  October of 1946 he gets a bunch of Hollywood execs into an auditorium. And there on stage is the MGM Symphony Orchestra and Jack along with his magnetophone.   The orchestra starts to play. Jack records them as they are playing on his magnetophone. And thenfoom!drops the curtain. So now the execs cannot see what is happening on stage.  The music stops.   From behind the curtain the execs hear Jack or someone say to the orchestra...  Okay boys. Thats fine. Let us do another take. One two three four. They start playing again.   And this time in the middle of them playing they raised the curtain...  And it is not the musicians playing.  No. The musicians were all walking around smoking cigarettes and shaking hands and talking to each other while the magnetophone is playing back what they had just recorded.  And everyones jaw hits the floor.   Bing's radio producer witnessed that demo and said I gotta bring you to meet my boss because he is gonna want to be in on this. And that is how Jack Mullin met Bing Crosby.  Dad was given a demonstration and he immediately saw the huge potential of these new machines.  Bing famously said What do you need to make this thing work? Jack says 50000. And you know I am doing the movie version of this and Bing turns to some guy and says Hey write him a check you know? But basically that is what happened.  We are in the money we are in the money...  So Bing started recording the Philco Radio Time with Jack ...  On the two magnetophone machines that he had using this stack of tapes he brought back from Germany.   So they just got rolling right off the bat.  And season two the ratings shoot back up. Bing was back. But that was just the tip of the iceberg.   Yeah it justlike the whole world changed.  I mean you could point to this moment this collaboration between Jack and Bing and the Nazis as the beginning of modern media making. As well as I dont know the turning upside down of what is real. Which for a moment at least would send Jack and Bing in very different directions. That is after the break.  Collegiate collegiate. Yes we are!  Collegiate nothing intermediate.  No man  Things we never were and were having any use for red hot flannels  This is Romeo from Ypsilanti Michigan. Mixtape a special series from Radiolab is supported in part by Science Sandbox a Simons Foundation initiative. The Shanahan Charitable Family Foundation. And the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.        Where the blue              I am Simon Adler. This is Mixtape. Okay the magnetophone this device allows Bing Crosby to pre-record his show in such high quality that when he broadcasts it out to millions of Americans ...  It will sound just like it is live.  But that sleight of hand according to historian Mark Clark there was only the beginning of what this tape made possible.  Because you can edit it. and so suddenly now you do not have to be so constrained.  Wait so theyso was there no editing before the magnetophone?  Film of course does this long before right. This whole notion of editing and cuts and so forth that all pioneered well before this in film. But whats new is that you can do it with sound and not just images.  Which is a deceptively huge shift. Whereas with film you can literally see the jump cuts happening in front of your eyes with audio that was all invisible.  You can cut those pieces of tape and splice them together  Anyway you want. And no one was the wiser.   And Bing Crosby started taking advantage of this. This is some raw tape from his family archive that I dont think has been ever publicly played before.  Heart and soul. I fell in love with you heart and soul. The way a fool would do madly because you held me tight and stole a kiss in the night.  He would do a rehearsal run through. And then he would then do another performance and both of those were recorded.  And so if something like this happened ...  Look at me. Wait a minute. Time. Wrong words. Go back a little John.  I lost the place here.  It was no big deal.  Ah! Ahem.   They would grab the take of this song from the rehearsal and splicer it onto that authentic feeling introduction we just heard.  They were able to combine that. And so you could make the best possible show out of two different shows.   But ultimately Bing wanted even more flexibility.  Ba-ba-ba-da-bee-da-da   Like in this New York show broadcast in June of 1948.    Where Bing has a comedian on Fred Allen.   I mean Fred Allen is trying to make a joke about how there is not actually an audience there and Bing sort of bats it down.    I mean there was no audience. And yet you hear an audience that is not there laughing at a joke about an audience that is not there. I mean to be fair while they were recording there might have been a few people standing around so there might have been a tiny audience. But thats kind of the point. That then as well as now some 70 years later theres no way to know what was actually happening.    Thats right. It can create essentially a lie.  All those ... all those things. All those things I have ever. All thewhat the hell are you playing? That as not the melody. All thoseall those things youve ever pined for gee Ive...All those things youve always pined for gee Id like to see you looking swell. Baby...  I think he did not see a conflict between live and on tape in terms of authenticity.  Again Mary Crosby.  In terms of him making jokes he only saw the freedom and the reach and the possibilities.   Now I cant really hold this against Bing. Here at Radiolab we do stuff like this all the time. But Jack Mullin   In at least one moment felt differently.  Good morning. This is Eve.  Hi Eve. Simon here from Radiolab.  Hey Simon. How are you?  I am okay. How are you doing?  I am doing fine thanks.  So this is Eve Mullin-Collier.  And you are among many things the daughter of   I amYeah of Jack Mullin. Yeah. I am sitting in one of his chairs and I just said a little Hail Mary to call me which is something he would have done.  According to Eve the appeal of the magnetophone to Jack was not really about the flexibility but how it could capture the sounds of real life. She says her dad was always really obsessed with recording things.  You know as a elementary school kid he made his own records. You could buy blanks apparently at the store and record your own disks. And he was super interested in photography. He started producing documentaries on film.   Like this travelogue from 1928.   Accompanied by records for sound which included himself narrating.   Yellowstone when it only had a dirt road. And talking with Eve and watching some of these clips the sense I came away with was that he was trying to capture something real and true. Like what it was actually like to walk through a bombed-out city. Or stand on the bank of a mountain lake.   And that the magnetophone to himwell it could reproduce real life better than anything.   It was authenticity through the fidelity of the recording.  They were in fact the only sound recorders in the whole United States that performed with such fidelity. There was not anything that sounded as good as my two little German machines.  And according to Eve he loved that machine.  It was on multiple times a week he was playing something on that particular machine.  And at a certain point working with Bing Crosby he became uncomfortable with how his machines were being used.  I remember him telling me about when this was all really new.  Mm-hmm.  There was a comedian that came on the show and told a joke and the crowd just cracked up. They just laughed their heads off. But they could not play that joke on the air.  The joke was a little too blue.  But the producer came in and said I want that laugh. Save that laugh. That was a great uproarious laugh.  Pretty soon the producer was asking Jack to keep a whole library of laughs   Like 12 laughs. You know one through twelve.  That they could use wherever they wanted.  They would think Oh that is good for a laugh number three.  This all came to a head in 1947.  I kind ofI sort of hesitate to mention this one. But one day  She says Jack was there recording the show. A comedian comes in and tells a joke thats just not funny.  And the producer came in and said Hey I want you to use laugh number three after this joke. And it did not warranthe thought the joke did not warrant that boisterous of a laugh. He thought that that was wrong. That was the wrong thing.  She says she is not exactly sure why that particular moment stopped him in his tracks but maybe it was a question of degrees. I mean it is one thing to take a chuckle and turn it into a belly laugh. But to completely invent a laugh when there was no laugh before?  You know it was leading the audience and it was not honest. He was big onyou know he had high regard for purity and authenticity in sound of course but in joy.   She says as an example   He would not touch the family movies that hed shot of her and her siblings.   Those were off limits.   Yeah those were all just raw. All the home movies were just raw things.     It is interesting to me that you arethat the family footage that your dad took he never edited.  I do not know. I think it was important to him and to us. He did you know oh once a month or so he would pull them out and we would watch like when we were babies.   And he would tell stories. That is how he grew up. Everybody sat on the front porch telling stories.   That still is kind of what spoke to his heart.   And so in that moment when the producer told him to put in that laugh Eve says Jack would have pushed back. And said No. And while yes this moments small it was the start of something massive    This pseudo-reality we inhabit today.    I mean every time we pull up Facebook or Instagram to post something we find ourselves torn between I guess you could say Jack and Bing. You know between wanting something real and true. And then on the other hand wanting the freedom the flexibility to edit ourselves into whatever version we want. And what we often end up with is this cut off over dubbed mixtape of an identity where even we forget where the manipulation ends and the real begins.   Where the blue of the night meets the   Next week  I remember him like exclaimingbeing super excited about cassette tapes.  Oh really?  And thinking oh my gosh this is like the perfection of all of this.  We fast forward to the cassette with the story of what happens when this identity manipulation gets weaponized.
