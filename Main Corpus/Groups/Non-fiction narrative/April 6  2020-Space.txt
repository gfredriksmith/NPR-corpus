   Hey everybody it is Jad. Okay I want to announce something that is kind of new. You know we have been making Radiolab for a long time almost 20 years. And one of the questions that we get almost more than any other is which of your episodes are kid-friendly? Which episodes can I listen to with my kids? And it felt like a really important question to answer now that so many of us are isolated in our homes and having to figure out home schooling. I am certainly in that situation. So we wanted to -- we wanted to help you guys out. So we launched a new podcast it is called Radiolab For Kids. Basically we went through our entire archives gathered together some of our most favorite kid-friendly episodes and put them all in one place. You can go to Radiolab.org and subscribe to it there or you know wherever you get your podcasts search for Radiolab For Kids and you will find it. And we are gonna keep adding to this feed. And just to kick the whole thing off I thought I would play one episode that is in that group that we have curated. This is one of the first Radiolabs I ever made and the reason I wanted to start with this one is you know it is funny I have been having a lot of conversations in the last few weeks with my oldest kid who is 10. He is been asking me a lot of questions about space and black holes and I found it to be a really comforting topic of conversation right now. And I do not know why maybe it is something about the scale. You know we are in this moment where we are thinking about shifting of scales giant pandemics sweeping the globe how humans are so tiny and powerless at times. And all of this can be very scary. Here's a chance to take some of that same way of thinking that same way of shifting scales but apply it to something that is much more about wonder and discovery. So hope you enjoy it. Here's an episode all the way back from the beginning of Radiolab. It is called Space.     Some people go to therapy some to church. Others come here to the northwest corner of a parking lot on Fire Island where most nights you will find a handful of people looking up.   I come down here quite often. It is a great place to stargaze. You got the sound of the ocean in the background with the crashing waves. It just adds to the relaxation of it you know?   The night I visited this guy Ron was about one of 20 enthusiasts huddled over astral maps staring through telescopes of all sizes.   This is quite a -- quite a telescope you have got.   Some so big you needed a ladder.   Wow that is a big cluster of stars.   Yes it certainly is.   Do you get attached to certain stars?   Oh yeah. Yeah you do. You begin -- you know the first ones you ever found and stuff like that.   Do you remember your first?   Yeah Albireo was one of my -- I really like. Ron's gonna show it to you I think.   I did not catch your name actually.   John. John.   What it is is that to the naked eye Albireo just looks like a really faint single star but when you look at it through a telescope ...   Just have a look in there.   Yeah yeah. Oh my God they are so bright! Like little flashlights.   Through the telescope Albireo looked like a headlight bright and flat and close. Very immediate. But that was nothing compared to what happened next. A woman walks up points her finger at the star ...   Okay. So is that -- is that the one up here?   ... and touches it.   That one right there.   Touches the star.   That is really cool.  That was one of the coolest things I have -- describe what you just did please.   I turned on my green laser and I pointed it at the star.   It was one of the coolest things I have ever ever ever seen. Her name was Linda. She had a pen that was a laser and when she turned it on a focused bright green beam of light sprung from her hand to the star like a long green finger. She literally touched the star. And for a moment I forgot the ground underneath my feet and that that star Albireo was 50 million light-years away. It seemed right there.   So tell me -- I mean what do you see when you look up? Besides you know nebulas and stars and star clusters but what do you sort of look for exactly?   Well you can really see sort of like where you are in the universe or at least in our own galaxy. And it makes like a very interesting perspective for yourself you know and like what life is like here and what life must be like in other worlds and whether or not there is other planets out there with people or different life forms that we cannot even comprehend.   This is Radiolab. I am Jad Abumrad. Today on the program we are gonna project our minds out there to the great beyond and ask some basic questions. Here to help as always ...   Hi.   Is Robert Krulwich.   And in this hour we discover how big -- oh sorry. And in this hour we find ourselves in space. We discover how immense how huge space is and then we ask ourselves Now where does that leave us?   We are a speck on a speck on a speck on a speck.   And as astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson will remind us later in the program it is difficult for little specks like us to find walking talking intelligent specks somewhere else in the universe. But say what you will we are trying.   Speaking of which let us begin by rewinding the clock back to 1977.   Okay.   This was a big year for the space program because in August of that year NASA launched a spacecraft carrying a gold record. You remember this right?   I do. I remember.   The record carried a message from us to them. Our story. Now it was Carl Sagan ...     Who led the team that made the record and that team included -- actually it was headed by Annie Druyan. I visited Annie at her home in Ithaca New York and we sat in the backyard near a waterfall in the same spot she says where Carl himself would sit and become so absorbed in what he was reading that he would not notice a deer standing right next to him.   My name is Annie Druyan and I was honored to be the Creative Director of the Voyager Interstellar Message Project which began in early 1977.   Now how did this come about? I think about the project now and it is so exciting to think about. I mean it is such a romantic idea. Did you know that at the time?   Absolutely. We felt first of all that this was a kind of sacred trust. That here we were half a dozen very flawed human beings with huge -- huge holes in our knowledge of all of these subjects building a cultural Noah's Ark. It was a chance to tell something of what life on Earth was like to beings of perhaps a thousand million years from now because the -- the Voyager engineers were saying this record will have a shelf life of a billion years. If that did not raise goosebumps then you would have to be made of wood. It was also the -- the season that Carl Sagan and I fell so madly in love with each other. And here we were taking on this mythic challenge and knowing that before it was done two spacecraft would lift off from the planet Earth moving at an average speed of 35000 miles an hour for the next thousand million years and on it would be a kiss a mother's first words to her newborn baby Mozart Bach Beethoven greetings in the 59 most populous human languages as well as one non-human language the greetings of the humpback whales. And it was a sacred undertaking because it was saying we want to be citizens of the cosmos. We want you to know about us.   Tell me about the moment you fell in love with Carl Sagan. You said it was during the Voyager compilation.   Yes it was. It was on June 1st 1977. I had been looking for some time for that piece of Chinese music that we could put on the Voyager record and not feel like idiots for having done so. And I was very excited because I would finally found a ethnomusicologist composer at Columbia University who told me without a moment's hesitation that this piece Flowing Streams which was represented to me as one of the oldest pieces of Chinese music 2500 years old was the piece we should put on the record. So I called Carl who was traveling. He was in Tucson Arizona giving a talk. And we had been alone many times during the making of the record and as friends for three years and neither of us had ever said anything to the other. We were both involved with other people. We would had these wonderful soaring conversations but we had both been completely just professional about everything and as friends. And he was not there left a message. Hour later phone rings. Pick up the phone and I hear this wonderful voice and he said I get back to my hotel room and I find this message and it says Annie called. And I say to myself 'Why did not you leave me this message 10 years ago?' And my heart completely skipped a beat. I can still remember it so perfectly. And I said For keeps? And he said You mean get married? And I said Yes. And we had never kissed we had never you know even had any kind of personal discussion before. We both hung up the phone and I just screamed out loud. I remember it so well because it was this great eureka moment. It was just like a scientific discovery. And then the phone rang you know? Like -- and it was Carl and he said I just want to make sure. That really happened. We are getting married right? And I said Yeah we are getting married. He said Okay. Just wanted to make sure. And the spacecraft lifted off on August 20th and August 22nd we told everyone involved. And we were together from that moment until his death in 1996 in December.   Wow talk about romantic my God!   It was so romantic. And part of my feeling about Voyager obviously and part of what I was feeling in the recording of my brain waves my heart my eyes everything in that meditation on the record. I had asked Carl whether or not it would be possible to compress the impulses in one's brain and nervous system into sound and then put that sound on the record and then think that perhaps the extraterrestrials of the future would be able to reconstitute that data into thought. And he looked at me on a beautiful May day in New York City and said Well you know a thousand million years is a long time you know? Why do not you go do it because who knows you know? Who knows what is possible in a thousand million years? And so my brain waves and REM every little sound that my body was making was recorded at Bellevue Hospital in New York. This was two days after Carl and I declared our love for each other. And so what I often think is that maybe a hundred million years from now you know somebody flags that record down and I always wonder because part of what I was thinking in this meditation was about the wonder of love and of being in love. And to know it is on those two spacecraft. Even now in my -- whenever I am down you know I am thinking And still they move. 35000 miles an hour leaving our solar system for the great wide open sea of interstellar space.   Billions of years from now the sun will have reduced this planet to a charred ashy ball but that record with Ann Druyan's brain waves and heartbeat on it will still be out there somewhere intact in some remote region of the Milky Way preserving a murmur of an ancient civilization that once flourished on a distant planet.   Two hearts on a wing. Very nice.   It is lovely right?   Yeah it is. Although there are six plus billion earthlings right now and the best thing I think about Earth is that we are so various.   Right.   So you are gonna get six-plus billion versions of being an Earthling.   Yeah like if you were Annie Druyan and Carl Sagan what would your recipe of us be? So we asked a bunch of people.   Who?   Comedian Margaret Cho you know her?   Uh-huh.   Neil Gaiman this graphic novelist. Michael Cunningham an author. The very famous chef Alice Waters. They all sort of you know told us what they would send. I will play you one. Not gonna play all ...   Yeah just one. I do not want to hear them all.   It would take too long. You can hear all of them on our website actually Radiolab.org. But here is one guy we asked. He is a composer.   This is Philip Glass speaking. The reason I have chosen Bach is that he had the ability to do two things at once. One was to -- to deal concretely with the language of music almost you could say grammar of music. At the same time while he was doing a lot say with one part of his brain he was able to create music that we empathize with. He takes you by the hand as it were and walks you into states of being that you did not even know existed. Bach goes out in the spaceship. Whether anybody can hear it or not we will put it in the spaceship. But I would also recommend strongly that we bring music in from other world traditions whether it is from Africa or whether it is kind of a throat singing that you might hear in Siberia or in the Arctic or wonderful flute playing that you might hear in South India. I was in India in 1966 or '67 and I was in a small village in the Himalayas called Kalimpong on the border of Bhutan and Tibet. And a friend of mine a rug dealer I had been in his shop numerous times to look at his rugs ran out of the shop and said Oh Mr. Glass come with me. I want to show you a picture. And he had gotten ahold of a film clip of Gandhi. It was a march he took in the '30s called the -- it was known as the Salt March. The English had put a tax on the use of salt. Thousands and thousands of people joined him and they walked into the sea and they took their garments put them into the water and harvested the salt.     And I saw the picture of this tiny little man really surrounded by thousands upon thousands of people leading this march. And it was so moving. I think what you have to do is get that piece of footage. It articulates in this very simple act how societies change how people that appear to be powerless and insignificant can bring about huge changes.   Jad here. Robert and I will continue in a moment.     This is Radiolab. I am Jad Abumrad.   And I am Robert Krulwich.   And this hour were talking about space sending stuff into space little messages in bottles or capsules as it were so that the extraterrestrials of the future might one day find it.   If there are any.   Well yes. Yes. But surely there are. I mean someday Anne Druyan's space capsule is bound to run into someone and they will know about us.   Well I -- just a second here. I know that the Anne story was beautiful and that you are in some kind of romantic haze ...   But hey!   But if you would just get a little more cold-hearted here about solid facts you might feel differently about this whole thing.   What do you mean?   Well what do you think is the likelihood of Anne's message of love ever being read by an intelligent alien somewhere in the universe?   I see where you are going with this. What do you have to ask that question? I mean it is just a gesture. It is like a romantic thing.   No no. This is an attempt I think to be fair to her to have a real conversation. She wants someone to hear about this but the chances are so remote when you consider the vastness of space. Suppose for example you wanted to visit just -- I do not know make it easy the very next star to us okay? Actually that is too lucky. To meet a civilization I think it would be so odd to come out and find one in the very first stop. Let us go four stars out to a star called Zeta Tucanae.   I see. You have been digging up on this.   I look -- I admit I looked it up. If we increase the speed of the Voyager capsule Anne Druyan's message from 35000 miles an hour that is how fast she was going right?   Yeah that is right.   Increase that speed to say a million miles an hour how long do you think would it take for you to get to Zeta Tucanae?   300 years.   Mm. 30000 years.   Seriously? Whoa!   This Jad Abumrad is a 1200 generation trip. Do you know where the Abumrads were 1200 generations ago?   Where?   They were living in a cave beating on a drum. That is what they were doing. So imagine a space trip in which you have to go forward 1200 generations. That is a long trip.   You are such a downer.    Well you think that is tough? Listen to this. There is a whole 'nother problem we are gonna have to deal with.   Oh boy.   Not the problem of distance. In this case there is a problem of time. We have one of those too. Every civilization has an arc. You can think of it in threes.   Step one.     Step two.     And step three.      What the hell was that?   Well a million years ago we were practically apes.     We would hardly begun to have conversation. Now we have technology. We have radio and TV and the universe can hear us.     But how long will it be do you think before either from global warming or from some kind of war we are ...     The way the news has been recently? Days weeks.      In any case.   I am gonna guess like a hundred million years or ten million years but that is still a flash of time in a universe. Now suppose instead of one civilization let us have two civilizations another one out there.   Mm-hmm.   If they arrive on Earth ready to talk and we are oh ...     ... then there is no way to have the conversation. Or on the other hand if they arrive on Earth after ...     ... then there is nobody to talk to.   I see.   And in a 14-billion-year universe with each civilization lasting you know only 10 million years what are the chances of two civilizations lining up in perfect synchrony so they can have a conversation? It is almost mathematically impossible.   Yeah fine fine. But you have to keep something in mind though right?   What?   As a rule people who make the argument you are making right now pessimists as it were as a rule those people are usually proven wrong It is -- that is always how it goes. Let me play you something.   Well in the history of human navigation lots of things have seemed too lonely and too far away until someone did them.   This is the guy who produced the Voyager record. His name is Tim Ferris.   I mean settling Polynesia in canoes navigating by the stars and the currents alone and hitting a tiny island after crossing hundreds or even thousands of miles of open ocean that is a pretty lonely scary thing to do and yet thousands of Polynesians did it. So I do not know what our future in interstellar space flight will be but it is -- it is important to keep in mind that the record of people who said that this or that journey of exploration is impossible or ill-advised historically those sorts of predictions have not fared very well.   Yes so you just hold your horses right?   Well I mean look Tim is talking about the Pacific Ocean which is big but I am talking about the universe here. Mine is a much much bigger space and therefore a much much much bigger problem. And when I want to ask questions about space ...   Yes.   I usually go to this guy.   See now I realize what is happening here. I hear you through that speaker but not through my headphones.   Who is this?   This is Brian Greene Professor of Mathematics and of Physics at Columbia University.   Are we -- are we on? Okay.   So Jad I said to Brian if we have got a spacecraft crawling through this vast vast empty universe how long a trip is it for just to start from wherever it is now to the -- to the end of the universe? And by the way what is -- where is the end of the universe?   That is a very natural question. You know in most environments you can walk for a while but then you hit the end you hit the end of the city the end of the state the end of the country. But when it comes to the universe we believe that there is probably no edge. There is no end. Now how do you picture that? Well one possibility is that maybe that the universe just goes on forever.   Mm-hmm.   Space may just carry on you can just keep on going and you will just never run out of space. The other possibility is it could be that you walk off into space for a while and you keep on walking and after a while you realize that you have actually circled back to your starting point. Sort of like on the surface of the Earth you do not find an edge. You cannot fall off the Earth's surface because when you walk ultimately you will come back to your starting point. That idea may apply to the fabric of space to the entire cosmos.   Although the Earth analogy is a little insufficient because when I am walking in Central Park I am on the edge of the Earth because when I look down I see Earth but when I look up I see non-Earth I see gas around the earth. So I am at the edge.   Well ...   It is as if I were on a balloon. I am on the surface of the balloon looking out at non-balloonness.   Yeah that is where the analogy fails. If you are on the surface of the Earth you can jump off you can jump up.   Yeah.   So it feels like you are on an edge. But in the universe there is no notion of jumping off because there is nothing beyond the space that we inhabit. It is all there is and there is nothing outside of it.   And now to make things even harder for our little capsule traveling through space we now know that space that the universe and the space that it is is expanding constantly expanding. So imagine our little craft all alone in nothingness and every minute there is more nothingness and more nothingness and more nothingness and more ...   Has this always been happening?   We think it is been happening since the very beginning. So if the Big Bang was the origin of the universe then this expansion has been going on for 13.7 billion years.   So there is more space all the time?   Yes.   Does that mean that it takes a longer time to go from one part of the universe to another is that ...   Absolutely. Absolutely.   So when you say something like the universe is expanding what that seems to mean to you is that the empty spaces in the universe are getting bigger?   Yes. So the -- the intuitive but wrong picture would be that you picture the universe expanding into a pre-existing space a pre-existing realm that the universe is now filling.   Like a balloon.   Like a balloon. Filling say the room in which you are blowing it up.   Yeah.   But that imagery is wrong in the following way It is not that the universe is expanding into a pre-existing space it is that as the universe expands it creates more space. It creates the new space that it then in habits.   Does that mean that there is no middle of the universe?   Yes. The old idea was that there is a central point in the universe and the old idea was that we were at that central point in the universe. But in the current way and more modern way of thinking about the universe there is no center. The universe is actually expanding but it is not expanding from a certain point in space. All of space is stretching uniformly.   Brian Greene is Professor of Physics and Mathematics at Columbia University. This leaves us in a sort of strange position.   Yeah lonely position.   In the sense that we have this little capsule riding somewhere in a space which just keeps changing. We do not know where it is or where we are relative to other things and whatever we know is changing all the time. It used to be so different. Neil deGrasse Tyson who runs the Hayden Planetarium in New York City says once upon a time we knew where we were at least we thought we knew where we were and we were the stars.   Well before Copernicus the idea of our place in the universe was largely accepted to be the center. It looked that way for sure. You stand here on Earth and look up and the sun rises and sets and the moon rises and sets and the stars rise and set and the planets rise and set. When Copernicus came around he put the sun in the middle of the known universe allowing the planets to then go around the sun relegating Earth to the status of a planet being one of these objects that goes around the Sun.   Now that was a very dangerous idea at the time apparently.   Yes because that idea conflicted with all prevailing interpretation of scripture. It had deep societal ramifications and Copernicus knew this. He knew it so well that he said I am gonna make sure I am dead before this hits the bestseller list. So ...   You mean he did not want to publish during his own lifetime?   This book was basically published on his deathbed.   Copernicus was 1600s?   Oh 15.   15? Okay.   Oh yeah. 1543 I think was the pub date.   So now what happens? So -- so now we are no longer -- humankind is no longer at the center of things. Now what?   Well we are no longer at the center of the then-known universe.   Right.   The then-known universe was the objects of the solar system the planets. But you look up at the night sky beyond the planets what do you see? Stars. There is stars in every direction. In fact if you count how many stars are to your left how many are to your right how many are above and below -- it is about the same in every direction you look. Hey maybe even if Earth is not the center of the solar system the solar system is in the center of the rest of the universe.   Yeah.   Yeah. That is the ticket okay? Now we can dig out of this hole that Copernicus put us in.   Yeah.   Let us go ahead and do that.   So our group is king.   Oh yeah. Our little family of planets we are in the center. And so that prevailed for a while because it is a comforting concept not only for the public but for the scientists as well. It was not until the 1920s where Harlow Shapley then head of Harvard College Observatory noticed globular clusters. Those were more in one direction of the sky than the other.   Huh.   And he deduced that these things ought to know where the center of the gravity is rather than these measly handful of stars that are sitting in front of us around on the sky.   Oh you mean these big fat concentration of stars?   Big fat hundred thousand star beehive concentrations of stars. Star clusters. They ought to know where the center of the galaxy is even if these single stars do not. And so he deduced that the center of the galaxy was off in the direction of Sagittarius on the sky okay? So now people are fighting that people are fighting that but then all hell breaks loose because 1920s come in Edwin Hubble grabs the business end of the biggest telescope of the day and determines that these fuzzy things among the stars are not the same distance as the stars themselves. They are vastly farther away. In fact you know they kind of look like what this collection of stars might look like from afar. In fact maybe they are other Milky Ways maybe they are other galaxies maybe we are not the whole story.   Oh boy.   Man.   Meanwhile the sky keeps getting bigger and bigger and deeper and deeper and bigger and deeper and bigger and deeper. Yeah.   Man oh this was terrible for the ego.   I can tell you I am disappointed myself.   Oh man. And so now okay maybe we are in the center of the -- that universe.   Yeah let us hope for that.   Because we look this way we see about the same number of galaxies this way as that way as that way as that way. Kind of looks like we are at the center. And they are all receding from us. So hey we are at the center then. You know but now we are smarter than this now. We are saying we are not gonna fall for that okay? We have fallen for that one nine times already. We are not gonna fall for this again.   You mean somebody's sitting there in the corner thinking Every time we make ourselves the star of the show we are wrong.   We are wrong. So I am -- we are not gonna make that mistake again. And so you then apply Einstein's general theory of relativity and it says if you live in an expanding universe in this fabric of space and time no matter where you are it will look like you are at the center.   Which means what? There is no center?   Yes.   Every center is an illusion.   Yes. And so that is how we could look like we are at the center of the actual universe even though we are not because everybody sees the same signature of the expansion. Now there is an even stronger argument for -- than the numerics. Let us look at the ingredients of the human body. You learn from biology class we are mostly water.   Right.   But what is water mostly?   Hydrogen and oxygen.   Hydrogen. Hydrogen and oxygen. Let us look in the cosmos. The number one ingredient in the cosmos is hydrogen. Next in the universe Oxygen. Next on Earth and in life Oxygen. Next in the universe Carbon. Next in life Carbon. Next in the universe Nitrogen. Next in life Nitrogen. One for one you go down the list. We are not simply in this universe the universe is in us.   So we are not the center of the universe we are on the side. Then our gang is not the center of everything but it is just out on a wing and then a galaxy that we are a part of is one of many. And the fact that we are alive is maybe not unique.   I got something worse ...   How low can we go?   Oh we can go lower. You ready?   Yeah.   You want to go lower?   Yeah.   Okay. We may not even be the principal stuff of the universe. That is how insignificant we are okay?   What do you mean?   We have learned the universe has this stuff that has gravity but does not otherwise interact with matter as we know it. It does not shine. It does not reflect. It does not block. It is dark. It is called dark matter.   So how much of the universe is the stuff that we can either see or that is blocked but we can kind of detect?   Four percent.         What are you talking about?   I told you we are gonna sink low. You asked how low can we go?   You mean like 96 percent of the universe is missing?   96 percent of the universe is not us it is something else.   Is it your working bias that if I came to you with a new discovery in which we were less important or a discovery which proposed that we were more important that you would guess that my scientific discovery that said we are less important is more likely to be right?   No doubt about it. That is correct. Now you cal that a bias but I do not. I call that track record.       Okay? Track record. We have among our exhibits here our timeline of the universe that begins with the Big Bang and you walk the equivalent length of 100 yards and time goes by with every step you take. 70 million years depending on how long your legs are. 70 million years per step.   Yes.   Per step. And you do that for a hundred yards. And you get near the bottom it is a gently sloping ramp. You get to the bottom of the ramp and then you are reminded that 65 million years ago the dinosaurs were roaming the Earth ready to become extinct. And then you take one more step on this ramp and you reach modern-day. Well at the end of that ramp we have mounted a single strand of human hair. The left side of that hair cavemen were drawing cave paintings. The right side of that hair is this conversation right now. So we are a speck on a speck on a speck on a speck.   And the speck that you just heard talking who is over six feet tall by the way is Neil deGrasse Tyson astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City.   See that right there though is why I think a lot of people do not like science. Because any time that anyone normal wants to say that we are important ...   Mm-hmm.   ... there is some scientist in a corner who is yelling Bah that is just a speck!   That is you know science's preference but I do not -- I think artists Shakespeare for example who says what a piece of work is man how noble in reason and all. It seems like it is art's job to say that we are special significant glorious and it is science's job to say No we are not.   Right. Well -- well maybe art is where we should go next. Stay with us. I am Jad Abumrad.   And I am Robert Krulwich.   And Radiolab will continue in a moment.           This is Radiolab. I am Jad Abumrad.   And I am Robert Krulwich.   And this hour on Radiolab we are looking at space. More specifically our place in it our place in the cosmos.   It is big. We are little.   Yes. But since as you mentioned before the break sometimes artists have their own particular ways of tilting things back in our favor let me introduce you to someone.   Introduce yourself.   He is an artist.   I am Dario Robleto.   Dario Robleto.   An artist. Live in San Antonio Texas.   I ran into Dario actually New York at the Whitney Museum. He was 27 and this was his first solo show.   My first show here in New York first solo show at the Whitney.   Sculpture mostly. That is his main thing. But on a side wall he was displaying some photographs.   So tell me what we are looking at.   Which I asked him to show me.   It is a series of seven digital photographs framed on the wall.   Side by side seven photos all showing the same thing.   Tomato seeds.   Seeds.   That are at different stages of blossoming.   Think back to kindergarten. That is what these remind you of. The day your teacher came in and said Okay class we are gonna grow some seeds. These pictures are of that day. But more specifically the day the seeds actually grew. Because each photo -- and there are seven -- shows one seed tiny little seed poking its head out of a massive cup.   So what I did was these are custom-made porcelain cups. If you can imagine the size of a Styrofoam cup.   Dario made the cups put some dirt and a seed inside and then crammed the top full of cotton.   Cotton which is also another schoolroom element.   Final step When the seeds grew like right at the moment that they grew he snapped photos.   They are -- each one's at a slightly different stage of development but basically it is -- it is that moment when the leaves are pushing at -- like you know waking up from a long sleep which that one kind of looks like yawning and your arms go up in the air. Also I should point out that there is text printed right on the cups just as if you know a kid had written their name or something.   In loopy cursive.   Can you read me the names of the people on there?   Yeah. So we have M.J. Smith F.R. Scobee S.C. McAuliffe J.A. Resnik ...   Maybe you recognize those names maybe not. But here's the backstory as Dario tells it. It is 1984. Everyone's excited about space and NASA ...   NASA built this probe. It is called the LDEF. It stands for the Long Duration Environmental Facility.   This was a probe that was basically meant to store things for long periods of time. So it had all these compartments.   52 compartments I believe. And NASA for the first time opened it to the public.   It was brilliant PR. They said Okay America. We have got this probe with all these compartments. What would you like to send into space?   They kind of said you send in a proposal for what you would like to put on board ...   And we will consider it. People of all stripes sent in ideas Ant farms paint samples pond water.   All the way to a group of school kids got together and said Hey can we put some seeds on board? So and NASA's I think seeing the great potential in what these children proposed furthered the experiment a bit and put aboard a lot of seeds for the sole purpose that when they returned they would be redistributed to the classrooms as a cool you know space seed artifact.   April 6 1984 the probe filled with seeds and all kinds of things goes aboard the space shuttle.   It goes aboard on the space shuttle Challenger.   Launches successfully.   Probe is deployed from the Challenger and it was scheduled to be picked up on the next shuttle mission by the Challenger. Well the day on that pickup mission was the day the Challenger exploded.       In a flash seven people were gone and America changed its mind about space.   And the whole space program got put on hiatus for I think it was almost two years.   And meanwhile that little probe the Challenger had been on its way to get and which was only supposed to be up there for about nine months well it stayed up there.   This is a case where something literally got lost in space because this is ...   It was floating out there.   This probe designed for nine months ends up sitting in orbit for almost seven years.   January 19th 1990 the probe is finally brought back after seven years by another space shuttle mission this time without fanfare. Because all the kids that would have wanted those seeds were grown up. They did not know or care anymore. And the only people that did were collectors NASA geeks.   And ...   And Dario ...   I was able to obtain some of those seeds that went aboard that day.   Through an online auction.   Luckily they were vacuum-sealed the whole time but they were incredibly moody little seeds. They did not want to cooperate.   He planted the seeds in the cotton-filled cups and the seeds did break through the cotton like spaceships bursting through clouds. And right as they did he snapped photos. But then days later and suddenly they all died. All of them.   So none of these seeds are alive anymore?   No and -- and I wanted them to and like I said they just -- something just was not right anymore. I had originally you know wanted to take them to full bloom. It just -- it was not meant to be. But getting it here was quite a miracle. So I will take this -- this stage.   If you willfully invest in the illusion of a photograph as Dario does this stage means that the seeds and everything they represent the lives of the crew the hope of a class of schoolkids is frozen.   Alive again forever.   Forever. Then again this is just an art project. Sometimes reality does not cooperate because here's the sad coda to the story. It turns out the shuttle that picked up the probe in 1990 and brought it back was the Columbia. And just before Dario was preparing to show his pictures ...   Just by coincidence I had the photographs laid out in front of me going over some framing issues when the tragedy was first reported that morning.     To know suddenly the only two shuttles that these seeds ever had anything to do with were the two that we lost it really hit me hard.   Dario Robleto's an artist. Lives in San Antonio Texas.   Nobody promised that space travel would be safe or pleasant or easy or even rewarding. All that was promised was that it would be an adventure and sometimes we were in the mood and sometimes we were not.   Well Anne Druyan Carl Sagan's widow who began the show she remembers what it was like at the very beginning.   President Kennedy 1962 makes a speech which if you read about it in Herodotus you know that some Persian king decreed that we would walk on the moon.     It was the stuff of dreams.     Now of course it was in reality part of the worst part of the Cold War and the madness of the nuclear arms race but it brought out the very best in a whole bunch of people. And I remember feeling in first walking on the moon when Americans first walked on the moon you know I was enraged at my government's conduct in the world horrified by it. But I had to admit that it made me really proud. And then as soon as NASA became involved with the space shuttle we lost the grand purpose. And it was very much to me as a mother of two children remembering when they were young that when they would -- were toddlers and they were first learning to walk they would run away from me and encounter some frightening reality 10 12 feet away and then turn around and come running back to be around my ankles. And that is what the last 25 years of the space program has been like. A kind of retreat to our mother's skirts.   Yeah according to Annie Druyan somewhere around the space shuttle we lost our nerve.   Yeah although there is now a new generation of people who would be space explorers and who say in the loud as possible way We do not want to be sissies in space anymore.       That space prize?   Right.   He was at a conference in Oxford in England called TED Global. It was an audience filled with entrepreneurs and technologists and he said to them You know why I created this prize? You know what is really gonna get people interested in space exploring space taking risks in space again?     And here his instinct is kind of different from Annie Druyan's. What is gonna bring people back to space he says ...     Money.     Wealth? Asteroids?   Think how much you could make if you could own an asteroid.     Hold on. What are -- what a puts?   That is what you do to finance grabbing one of those rocks as he puts it.      But the key here remember is that you got to create a business. And to do that you need a business plan some reason to invest and build and do. For that he has actually kind of a cool phrase.     Which in ordinary English means that there is got to be some way to get entrepreneurs to spend money their own money on some kind of space stuff.   And how exactly?   Well his first notion was he would sell tickets to rich billionaires. He sold a seat on the Russian space shuttle the Soyuz for 20-million.     What?     Not any people I know.   Well -- but . Yeah I guess you are not gonna get a whole lot of people at prices like that.   Uh-uh.   So then he came up with a bigger bolder broader plan which was a prize.   A prize?   Because remember when Charles Lindbergh flew across the Atlantic?   No I do not remember. I was not born yet.    Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic to win a prize.   That is really why he crossed? Seriously?   Yeah for a cash prize.   Huh.   Peter thought Why do not I create a prize of my own? And he came up with the number 10 million bucks. That would be the prize.   Why 10 million exactly?   Because it was just big enough to be really attractive to young scientific teams all over the world 10-million and just small enough to be boring to conservative clunky companies like Lockheed and Boeing who would not ever think of anything interesting anyway.   He was trying to split the difference I guess.   Yeah. But you know Peter does not have that kind of money. He is not a government. So where do you get 10-million?     You know how rare it is to hit a hole-in-one on a golf course?   Yeah.   Well the insurance industry will make you a betting proposition. If you go to the insurance company and say I bet that I can go up and down in space twice in the same two-week period and they go No you cannot and you say Well I will give you a million dollars in premiums if you give me a 10-million insurance policy. He made the offer the insurance company said Well this is not gonna happen right?     And amazingly ...     ... just two months before the deadline ...         Plus he got tons of publicity. He incentivized young scientists all over the world. He did it with other people's money. But then just as he was finishing the presentation there was this guy in the room who got up and said ...     Said You know Peter Diamandis maybe you are not that brilliant. Maybe all you are is lucky.                   That was a little too enthusiastic.   Yeah.             Yeah but that is -- that is -- that was a cop-out answer I have to say. Because when those people he is referring to the people who crossed the Atlantic crossed the plains when they did all those things and then when many of them died I mean thousands of -- I do not know how many.   Thousands I am sure.   Anyway but when they died those early Americans they died alone. There were no TV cameras around there was no Scott Simon on the radio. They were by themselves.   I think you are right.   It was a completely different time.   When you make it sensational people will die sensationally. And then what is gonna happen to the money and the entrepreneurs and the businessmen?   Right. That is exactly right.   Businessmen do not exactly have a sterling reputation for sticking by their guns. If you have a small financial problem showing up in Brazil people all over the world pull their money out of Brazil. You get a total rush for the exits. Total collapse.   It is true they are always the first to leave. You know money and wealth it is good motivators to get us back to space but once you get there it is got to be about something more than that.   Like what though? Because I agree with you it is just ...   Well it is -- I do not even know what to call it exactly. But you certainly hear it. Take the last transmissions from the moon in December of 1972.   Uh-huh. Oh last time we were there.   Yeah the last time we were there. The voices you hear of those astronauts coming back when you hear them talking ...     You hear something else.                       I was strolling on the moon one day in the merry merry month of December.             The Last Transmission From the Moon produced by Barrett Golding for HearingVoices.com. Thanks to him.
