       Yeah so Peter.   Yeah.   Matt.   Yeah.   Where do you want to launch into this?   Yeah. We are gonna start with this call.   Tuesday August 8th 2017.   This is a call from Bath County Eastern Kentucky.   51 and 26 seconds.    It is a call from dispatch to ...   County four units four units to respond.   The Bath County EMS station.   These are the people that are dispatched to medical emergencies.   When I started I remember it was like one or two oclock in the afternoon something like that.   Tones went off for a unresponsive male.   So thats Scotty Whiteman.   Yup.   The other voice is Jay Fo.   We are partners in the EMS service in Bath County Kentucky.   Anyways call comes in.   First one of the day.   Scotty and Jay hop in their ambulance and they rush over to this apartment complex. Theyd been there before. Its this kind of squat two-story building.   Like a strip mall almost.   When we get there ...   Jump out put the gloves on enter this small apartment.   And immediately when they come in off to the left is the living room.   Law enforcement's there.   The chief of police was there talking to the two people that were alert in the house a woman and a guy.   Who are sitting on a couch.   And then if you look immediately to the right it is just like the kitchen is there.   And that is where Scotty and Jay see ...   Lying on his back with his arms to his side.   A guy in his mid-50s.   Completely unresponsive.   He was laying in water about three inches deep where I guess somebody in the house ...   Had taken the sprayer from the kitchen sink and had sprayed him down.   Trying to revive the guy.   Bring him back to life. And it does not happen that way.   So Jay and Scotty enter the kitchen stand over this guy.   He had not started turning blue yet.   And so I checked and make sure he was breathing. And he was.   But barely.   Hes taking these really low shallow breaths.   And then I pulled his eyelids back and checked his pupils.   Theyre tiny pinpoints.   He was overdosed. Pretty indicative of opiates.   So I says Okay so we ...   So Jay grabs his medic kit. He goes into his bag and he pulls out this nasal spray. It is a drug called Naloxone.   It is also commonly referred to as Narcan. And it is a drug that is known as being this Lazarus drug.   Yeah because it immediately throws an opiate overdose into reverse. And like brings people back from the brink of death.   So Jay crouches over this guy and he takes this nasal spray sticks it up one of the guy's nostrils sprays it. Takes it out.   Waits a beat. Does the same thing to the other nostril.    Back awake within seconds.   The guy opened his eyes.   Thought what is going on?   I grabbed a towel and started drying him off.   And then I pushed him up so I could sit him up.   Got him up.   Got him onto the stretcher.   Loaded in the truck and we take off to St. Claire hospital.   Scottys up front. Hes driving the ambulance.   Jay's in the back with the patient.   Everything was good with him.   Everything was routine.   When all of a sudden ...   Scotty hollered through the window. He yelled at me I do not feel right.   I can remember a weird taste coming into my mouth and a real odd smell hitting my nose.   What are you tasting?   I cannot describe it. It was just -- it was like chewing on steel.     Scotty while hes driving he gets on the radio.     Hollering at the next county over saying Hey I need help.     I need you to send me an ambulance.       Made it to the bottom of the ramp. Put the truck in park.   Jay jumped out of the back and ran up to the front.   Went through the passenger side.   Got to Scotty.   He was already slumped over.   Unresponsive.   It was that quick.   Like he was out cold.   Huh. Not waking up anything?   No no. He is not responding at all.   So whats -- what is happening?   Well this is -- like this is the thing that I do not know was so shocking to me is that when Jay then checked out Scotty ...   He had pinpoint pupils snoring respirations.   He seemed to have the exact same symptoms as the patient in the back of the ambulance who had overdosed.   Wait what? The exact same symptoms?   Yeah. Thats what it looked like to Jay.   Well how can -- how does that even happen?   Well so -- so Jay explained it to us like they -- he says if you wind back they had gone into this apartment to treat this guy who was on the kitchen floor.   The guy was wet.   And he says he believes that when they were helping him up ...   Scotty had rubbed against his skin to skin contact with his forearm.   And Jay says he believes that what likely happened in that moment is that whatever drug this guy had taken had now gotten onto Scotty's arm absorbed through his skin into his system and then like 15 minutes later had caused Scotty to pass out.   Wow. Thats -- thats really strange.   Yeah it seems like a really unusual thing to happen. But the thing is like I guess what is even weirder is that like this was not the first time I had heard this story.   Right. Like Peter's been following this for awhile.   So yeah I have been keeping a list of these types of incidents and what I found is this was not an isolated incident. These types of things are happening a lot.     There have been cases reported in North Carolina Florida ...     Rural Ohio. Rural Pennsylvania.   From an accidental drug overdose.   West Virginia.     Texas California.       Massachusetts.       Vermont. New Hampshire.     Nebraska.         There is been over 100 reported incidents all over the country. So I mean I have been reporting on opioids for -- for a number of years. And I guess as I was watching these -- these kinds of incidents occur it kind of felt like I was watching a -- a contagion like unfold in real time.   Hmm.   I mean I guess when I was reading all these stories I was just thinking like What is going on here? Like what is happening?   I am Jad Abumrad.   I am Robert Krulwich.   This is Radiolab. And today we have a story about what happened that day in that apartment in that ambulance in Kentucky. Definitely kind of a mystery story.   But at its core it is really a story about -- about wanting to do good choosing to do good and then having to suddenly bear the cost of doing good.   Okay.   Story comes to us from Peter Smith freelance journalist. And it was also co-reported by ...   Peter!   Our producer Matt Kielty.   Hey everybody.   Okay so Kentucky.   Kentucky.     So we wanted to talk to Scotty and his partner Jay about what happened that day.   And about what is been happening.   So we flew into Lexington. We drove about an hour east?   Yeah there was some nice rolling bluegrass hills.   Yeah a lot of green. And we drove to this tiny little city called Owingsville.   And we are at the Bath County emergency medical services.   Where the Bath County EMS is.   White building linoleum siding big garage doors like you would see at like an auto shop. A couple big white Bath County EMS ambulances. Its funny there is a washerdryer an ashtray on top of it.   And attached to the garage is a one-story house basically.   So we essentially just showed up at this place to introduce ourselves and say Hey.   Yeah go ahead and sit down.   I am leaving.   There were a few people inside.   Gary the director of the station was there.   Yeah.   And you are serving the whole county?   Yeah I think it is 284 square miles I think is how big our county is.   You know about how many people that is?   A little over 12000 now I believe. And we are covering that all from one station.   Feels like -- there is beds in back?   Yeah beds in the back. Yeah.   You all end up just kind of like living here?   Yeah it is basically like an apartment.   There is a kitchen. We were in the living room with Gary sitting on a couch. There is these big la-Z-Boys a ginormous TV. Billy Bob Thornton was on!   Hes a mean dude.   In the show?   No he is just a mean dude in real life. Remember that? We went to a Willie Nelson concert and his band opened for Willie Nelson. And somebody in the audience heckled him and he just about came off the stage after him and he called him everything but a sewing machine and a milk cow. I mean I have -- he made up cuss words. Yeah he is a wiry little feller.   So we were kind of just hanging around with Gary.   It was probably like 15 minutes. And then ...   There is Scotty!   Scotty walked in.   That is Peter Smith.   Nice to meet you.   Matt Kielty.   How are you guys doing?   This is the EMT who overdosed?   Yeah Scotty's the guy that supposedly overdosed.   He is in his 50s white hair tall.   Hes got bright blue eyes.   I have a question.   Mm-hmm?   How did you even find out about all this?   I read it in the New York Times. There was one line in a story about three EMS personnel. I do not know if thats the true story ...   Yeah. Pretty much yeah. They picked up on the story.   Yeah and so then I -- I thought there was something unusual about that and I was curious to hear the real story.     Yeah give me just a few minutes and ...   Yeah yeah yeah. No rush. There is no rush.   We will sit down and then discuss things.   All right.   So eventually it was just the three of us in this living room.   Do you want to sit at the table or ...   Uh I was thinking ...   I mean maybe I should preface this by saying that you cannot really understand this story unless you understand a little bit about what EMS personnel do. I talked to some other EMTs that told me that everybody has their Why. Everybody has this thing they say. And it is like This is the reason I got into this line of business. I would say like a very small percentage like do not have second or third jobs. Like they do not make a lot of money. So everybody has this Why.   Yeah so maybe you can just like tell ...   And so I asked Scotty what his why was and he told me this story. And I think it is a really incredible story that not only explains why he does what he does but it also explained like why he holds onto certain things.   So in September of 1999 I was involved in an accident on the Pennsylvania Turnpike.   So it was early in the morning. It was raining.   Yeah it was during Hurricane Floyd.   He was out there for work.   Cross-country truckin.   What kind of a rig were you driving?   It was a Freightliner. And I was pulling a flatbed trailer with a load of pipe on it.   So he is barreling down the turnpike with this heavy load of steel on the back. And with the weather like visibility starts to get bad.   Slowed my speed way down probably running approximately 50-55 mile an hour.   And he comes through this construction site.   And something happened in the front end of the truck.   He heard a pop.   A front tire had blown out and I basically became a passenger at that point. There was no controlling it.   His 18-wheeler was like careening out of control down the turnpike and it -- it was like skidding across the wet pavement.   And the truck lunged to the right.   There was a concrete wall there that had guardrail attached to it. It nosed into the guardrail.   Came flying back across both lanes.   Back toward the center divider and the truck hit it.   Plowed through the center divider.   And began to like roll over.   And came down and struck a vehicle that was traveling the other direction.   Scotty says he does not remember much of what happened next other than his truck finally coming to a stop.   After that the next thing I remember was standing on the frame of the truck watching diesel fuel run underneath of me and I could hear the truck burning.   Somehow he -- he managed to get out of the cab and he is standing on this tail of the -- the cab. And the truck is on fire. And like while he is standing there like other people who were driving down the highway have stopped and they have started to like yell at him.   Screaming at me to get away from the truck. I got off the truck and I looked up the road and I saw the other vehicle and I knew then that it was not good. It   What did it look like?   It was -- it was a very destroyed vehicle.   So what happens next?   There was a lady had a minivan. I have no idea where she came from. She opened the side door on her minivan and had me sit in the floorboard until the ambulance got there. I remember looking down at my left hand and the back of my left hand all the skin was probably hanging down 8 to 10 12 inches where it had melted the skin and    Like your skin's just dangling off your body?   Yeah. I can remember when the ambulance getting there and there was a female paramedic. And when she walked up and looked at me I remember her going Oh my God! And I am like This as not good is it? And she said No. She did not lie to me. She said No it is not good.   He got rushed to a hospital. He had five broken ribs massive skin burns.   I do remember them telling me You are going to lose your left hand and I told them I said That is not an option I am left-handed.   Surgeons immediately started doing skin grafts.   Took skin off my legs and put it on my arms and my back. As you can see I have still got my left hand.   Still left-handed?   I am still left-handed.   And when -- you said it was a couple days after the accident when they told you about the other car?   Yeah.   How did that conversation unfold?   It was an attorney that was for the -- representing the trucking company that I was driving for was the one that actually told me about the fatalities that had been involved with the accident. So that was how I found out.   Do you remember what exactly happened?   I just remember him walking into the hospital room and he was like Hi my name is...   Like suit and tie sort of thing?   Yeah. And my name's so and so and I am with the -- I am an attorney with -- representing the company that you drive for. And we do not know if you have been informed of this or not but there was three fatalities involved. And no I had not been informed but I guess I have been now.   When we started into court proceedings that was when I found out names and -- and where they were from.  Where were they from?   They were from Connecticut. They had been on vacation in North Carolina. The hurricane coming in they were evacuated out of North Carolina. So they had decided that they were gonna travel up into Pennsylvania and try to find a place to finish their vacation in Pennsylvania. And that is what put them there. If I had have traveled two miles an hour faster or two miles an hour slower we would not have been at the same place at the same time.   Scotty eventually went back to long-haul trucking but he says that he kept thinking about that day about that accident the people who were killed.   I never forgot. I still have not forgotten.   But the other thing that really struck him about that day was that everybody who showed up to that scene the fire department the EMS ...   Everybody there was a volunteer.   And that is something he could not really shake.   That people volunteered to come to me and they did not know who I was. They did not care who I was. They -- they did not pass judgment on me that yeah I was in a horrific accident and I may have been the cause of that accident. They did not care. They viewed me as someone that needed help. And that was all they viewed me as.   And Scotty says the more he thought about it the more he felt like he had this -- this sort of debt to pay back for the lives that were lost that day.   For the ones that he -- that he extinguished. And the way that hes gonna do that is become a volunteer. Hes gonna become one of these people.   Who helps those in need.   That comes to your aid no matter what.   And as they say you know the rest is history. Here I am I am an EMT.     So we spent a few days with Scotty following him around on some of his runs. And as an EMT his main responsibility is to drive the ambulance but also ...     To assist his partner.   Hello!   Who is often Jay.   What is going on?   And out in rural Kentucky they get all sorts of calls.     Come here honey. They just want to look at you. It is okay you are okay.   How long has he been acting like that honey?   Since last night.   Okay.   Like a three year old who was having trouble breathing.   Just breathe! Look look at me it is okay.   A lot of calls from nursing homes.   Deep breath does that hurt? Got him on 6 on Main.   Where a call can be about something that feels like so small like a cough or low blood sugar.   Ready to go! Portable over to Main.   One night 20 at night got a call. Older woman fell off a porch they help pick up an elderly woman.   Oh good God. Good God.   Sometimes they get called to just give people their meds.   Youre gonna feel a big poke okay? Count of three here we go. 1-2-3. Big poke.   These are kind of like the everyday innocuous calls. And then of course like there are overdoses.   By the way I am -- I am Matt.   I am Earl. Nice to meet you.   Peter.   I am Earl.   Because we were like these out of town reporters everybody kept saying that we should go down to the old jail.   So you are the jailer?   Yeah yeah.   Which is where we met the county jailer Earl.   Hows it going sir?   How you doing there bud?   Im Matt.   And his friend Mitchell.  Nice to meet you.   Alrighty.   And so ...     So Earl let us into the jail. Its abandoned now.   Paint peeling off the walls.   He walked us into this front room.   Let us see where they have got 'em.   Its full of like weed-whackers lawn mowers.   Earl oversees the work-release program so the people that are in jail are sort of on this temporary work-release program where they like do lawn maintenance along the highway.   Where they got them at Mitch? Oh it is over there I see it.   Yeah.   And then Earl -- Earl grabbed this red bucket which he set down. Its like a knee-high bucket.   This is gonna be pretty nasty.   Oh my God!   That is from this year. Which you can see that is just this year.   That is so many syringes! How many you think you got in there?   I would say they's a thousand would not you Mitch?   Close anyway.   Yeah close to it. That was like all last year. All last year.   People on work release have been picking these up for like the past year.   This is just like litter on the highway?   Yeah.   You two -- it is been awful. They used to have the kids you know would clean up like Boy Scouts and stuff clean up along the roads. But it just got too -- too bad with the needles now. You just cannot do it anymore with the way the needles and stuff are. Mm-mm.   Yeah It is all kinds of . Probably another bottle full.   There is probably 20-30 in there. Here's another one. We got a problem here there is no doubt about that. There is definitely a problem with -- with heroin use.   Some of them got it in -- still got the stuff in there.   Oh still got the drugs in there?   Blood too.   Huh.   That first year we -- we really found them did not we?   And threw a bunch of them away too before we started saving them.   Yeah yeah.   Did it -- did it surprise you to find this many?   Really yeah.   Well it just all at once -- the heroin problem just started just like overnight here. I mean it was pills forever and then -- and then just all at once. I mean nobody even ever seen a needle did you Mitch?   No.   And then just all at once they were everywhere.   When -- when did you start seeing them?   About ...   About a year ago was not it?   Uh it is been longer than that. It is been about two -- two-and-a-half years ago. And it just -- and once it started you started finding -- they were everywhere.   So what do you think when you see -- see all these needles?   I just think it is -- it is a bad thing. It is -- it is destroying families and we have somebody dying here just all the time. I mean it is -- it is really bad. Sad. I have had a -- I had a very good friend that I lost what was it Mitchell back last August?   Yeah somewhere along there.   I had took him to rehab and he was in there for a couple months and he got out and done good and then -- and then that happened to him.   And that was sort of the incredible thing.   There is something for everyone here so have your pick.   All right well I will take a look around.   Okay.   Was that like everybody knew somebody who had been caught up in using opioids.   I mean nice families. Somebody in their family end up going bad.   Like I went to a yard sale because I love yard sales and ...   Every family's affected some way.   When I told the women who were sitting there on the driveway what we were reporting on they -- they said they had lost neighbors friends.   Well let us put it like this. In 2000 ...   You know one day when we were down there we had to take a Lyft.   No in 1990 I had a motorcycle accident which destroyed my left femur. I have got a 12-inch plate 10 screws and two pins that hold my left femur together.   And the driver told us about how hed started using pills.   And really came by it quite -- quite innocently.   I talked to a woman who worked at a thrift store who told me she lost a cousin to an overdose. Actually Jay told us about a friend of his.   He actually relapsed. He was in -- he was in therapy. His sponsor in Narcotics Anonymous overdosed and he had nobody to go to. So he relapsed and was found two days later in his car. So it was pretty bad.   And I -- I would assume that the EMS Scotty and Jay would have seen this -- this shift happen?   Yeah Scotty told us around 2017 overdose calls ...   Went from one or two a week to ...   Five six. One day ...   There was 11. And that was just unheard of in this county. It just -- to have many overdoses.   They told us they would treat the same person like five times over a few months. Like this is just their job.   Right. Theyre there to save peoples lives.   But this overdose problem and the sort of like moral calculus that any EMS person makes when they show up to help a person who -- who has ODed it started to shift when reports started emerging about this new drug. This drug that made it so simply coming into contact with a person like just simply touching them could put an EMS worker in danger.   Was not a lot known about it.   We talked to this guy Jason York about it.   He is the Emergency Management Director for the county.   When it first came out the reports that we were getting was it was literally airborne.  Have you ever seen it?   No.   What do you think like just hearing about it? I mean what is going through your mind when you hear about it?   World War Z. Walking Dead.   The drug is called fentanyl.   What is fentanyl? Like I know that it is an opioid but is it like ...   So fentanyl ...   Did not you talk to a guy about this awhile back?   I did. I talked to this guy John Cole.   Okay.   Can you tell me again like who you are?   Yeah. I am an emergency physician here at Hennepin County Medical Center which is a level one trauma center in Minneapolis.   He is also the director of the Minnesota Poison Control.   So fentanyl -- so fEntangle has been around for decades and we use it almost every day in my hospital in some capacity.   So fentanyl is an opioid its fully synthetic. Its manufactured in a laboratory. And it often comes in powder form but drug companies reformulated it into all sorts of things like fentanyl lollipops. And these lollipops are given to soldiers on the battlefield. Theres also fentanyl patches.   That people wear to get fentanyl into their body through their skin.   Oh so you can -- you can do fentanyl through the skin.   Yeah.   It is an easy way to put something on for people with really bad chronic pain people with cancer for instance use them.   It is just this really really effective painkiller.   Because fentanyl is really really potent.   I mean a lot of people refer to fentanyl as sort of the third wave of the opioid crisis.   Just for context. I mean what are the first two waves?   Yeah.   If you dont mind?   Well so if you go back to the beginning of the crisis the first wave was pills.   Right.   When in the early 2000s drug manufacturers began flooding communities with pharmaceutical-grade opioids.   Okay.   And the second wave was around 2011 when there was a crackdown on pills. And so a lot of people that were using pharmaceuticals began to migrate to heroin. And the Mexican cartels got very good at delivering that heroin. And then around 2013 ...     A third wave hits.     Drug dealers people that were selling heroin start looking to fentanyl.   Because fentanyl is so much cheaper to either make or obtain than normal heroin.   And most importantly fentanyl is way more potent. And so basically to -- to maximize their profit drug dealers start cutting fentanyl into heroin. The problem is that the people who are using they really have no idea what they are getting. They think they are just getting heroin.   And certainly by 2014 we started to see patients in our emergency department who were overdosed with what they thought was heroin that probably turned out to be fentanyl.   And as more and more people were overdosing ...     Dying ...     There were all these news stories about ...     This ...     Powerful ultra-potent synthetic opioid.     And there are versions of it where you know the molecule's changed a little bit and it makes it more potent.   And by 2016 ...           And carfentanil is extremely potent.     John says it was right around this time 2016 ...   There started to be reports of ...     Law enforcement ...     Emergency medical services ...     And even nurses in hospitals ...     Describing getting ill when they were exposed to powder that turned out later to be fentanyl or some other type of fentanyl.   How did you first hear about it?   How did I hear about it? You guys. The media.   Oh! I forget I am a representative of the media.      Scotty said he actually first heard about carfentanil on Good Morning America.  Started reading articles on it.   Jay saw other people in EMS tweeting about it.   You know what is this drug? What is going on?  But that is in the big city it is not gonna happen here.   And then one of our local law enforcement officers Bud Lyons ...   Oh so you would read about fentanyl?   I mean Ive read about it but I did not think it would come to a small city like this.   So thats Bud Lyons.   He is a police officer. He is a K9 officer here.   So what happened?   Basically I was dispatched to the funeral home.   So it was the summer of 2017 Bud got called out to the parking lot of the funeral home.   A female had passed out.   In her car.   When I got on scene woke her up got her out of the vehicle I noticed that she had some brown stuff on her face like a powder substance around her nostrils.   He searched the car and took into evidence a thousand dollars in cash.   And several little baggies of brown powder substance that turned out to be heroin.   And that same night as he was like back in the evidence room going through the money.   I did not have no gloves on when I was counting the money.   Started feeling funny.   Started feeling real dizzy could not think straight.   Dropped the money.   And drove his cruiser up here into the parking lot.   Of the EMS station.   And when he pulled in he went down.   A couple of EMS were there. Gave him this -- this Lazarus drug Narcan.   Rushed me to the hospital.   Had that ever happened to you before?   No. It is the first time it is ever happened. And you know just that little touch basically almost killed me.   Just a grain of fentanyl got on his skin and he is saying that is all it took?   Yeah. Like that was -- that was the story that was starting to like emerge really across the country. That like a tiny grain -- if you came into contact with a tiny grain of this drug it could take you down.   So as soon as that happened me and Scotty we made it a pact between us to carry extra Narcan in the truck for us in case we ever got exposed. Because I knew it was here in the county and in the city. And then about a month after that sure enough.   Chewing on steel. Put the truck in park.   My partner got exposed.   I can remember coming to and being in another ambulance.   Jay had given Scotty their Narcan they had stashed away.   His dose of Narcan and mine because he would not wake up after the first dose.   They got him to the hospital.   Scotty was kept under evaluation for about four hours.   And then eventually discharged.   The next day it was like that was when it hit on the fact of you know what? I almost died doing my job.   And that is essentially when what began as a call for help became a crime scene.   What do -- what do you mean?   I will tell you in a minute after the break.       Jad.   Robert.   Radiolab.   Back to Peter and Matt.   In Kentucky.   Something that I kept thinking about when we were down there in Kentucky driving around was that there is like no duty to render aid. Even though there are some exceptions and statutes in some states like for the most part there is just no obligation. We live in a society where you like do not -- you can sort of watch a person drown and you wont be held liable. You can do that. And thats legal. I just kept thinking about that.   Where are yall going to? I mean just all of Eastern Kentucky?   Weve mostly just been here.   Oh is that right?   So when we were down there with Earl the jailer.   Yeah in the jail the old Bath County jail.   We would just seen the needles and we were coming out to the parking lot. And we had spent probably like two or three days trying to find the people who were actually in the apartment. Like the person who overdosed and the other two people who we learned lived in that apartment.   I had a phone number but nobody was picking up. But we are with Earl and we just asked him if knew this guy Scotty Hatton.   Scotty White?   Hatton.   This is a different Scotty.   This is a different Scotty.   Right. Because Scotty Whiteman's the EMT who responded to the call had this seemingly like overdose exposure. Scotty Hatton lived in the apartment.   Yeah he was there the day that Scotty and Jay showed up.   Yeah I know him. What are yall wanting to talk to him or ...   Yeah. We just -- I mean we got the Scotty Whiteman side of the story and were just curious if ...   What are you wanting to talk to him about? What went on that night or ...   Just get his side of the story. I know ...   I dont think he could right now because his case aint final.   Sure.   I just about guarantee he wont.   But then he was like I can tell you where he is though because it turns out that Scotty Hatton had on ankle monitor and Earl you know he is the jailer so he just like pulls up his phone and looks up Scotty's GPS location.   Yeah and so the -- the little -- the little dot for the GPS showed exactly where he was. At this old cemetery.   That graveyard's what Mitchell?   And Earl said like we could go down there and like maybe he would talk to us.   So we get there. Pretty big and sprawling cemetery that was like 25 minutes out of town? Something like that?   Yeah lots of big trees cicadas.   Anyways Scotty was actually out on this riding lawn mower and we were standing there talking to his supervisor.   Right.   And then Scotty himself like gets off the lawnmower comes over to us.   What did he look like?   Sunken eyes. Um big eyes.   Pretty skinny guy.   He was wearing like a blue Duke ballcap.   Blue jeans.   So Scotty came over. His supervisors went on the lawnmower and started riding around. And Scotty immediately started talking.   It seemed like he wanted to tell his side of the story.   He said he got sick. I am looking online it is like sometimes it can take 24 hours.   And he was standing under this big oak tree kind of like on a steep slope.   Sorry do you mind -- I just missed the front of that. You were saying that you think its doubtful?   I think its very doubtful.   And he immediately started telling us that he was like suspicious of Scotty Whiteman's story. This whole like overdose by touch thing.   I mean because he only touched the -- my other co-defendant you know? And I had washed him off. You know I didnt know youre not supposed to wash someone thats overdosing off but I did. And this guys trying to say he got you know got infected by carfentanil. They didnt even find any drugs on the scene. They found very little paraphernalia. But I know Im done. Its just one of those things. Im going to church now. As soon as I get this ankle monitor off Im gonna get saved. I cant get saved in -- with the ankle monitor. You cant submerge it.   Where are you gonna get baptized?   Um I go to Freedom Church in Mt. Sterling. Probably gonna ask them. Being in front a bunch of people makes me kinda nervous.  We decided to meet up with him later because lawnmower cicadas. So we went to his aunts house.   He is was living there. He would gotten evicted from his apartment after the OD.   Well Im going.   Love you.   Love you too.   Youre going to see Grammy aint you?   Yeah. It was nice to meet you guys.   Nice to meet you too.   My old ladys in there. I dont know if she really wants to participate so ...   Jessica's in there you are saying?   So apparently Scottys girlfriend Jessica she was the other person in the apartment for this overdose she was also now living with Scotty at his aunt's but she didnt want to talk to us.   So then the three of us sat down on the couch in the living room and Scotty just started telling us about his own story. And I think his story definitely has -- is a very like sort of common trajectory.   Where -- like where did you grow up? Was it around here?   Yeah I grew up in Bath County. Ive been here my whole life pretty much.   So Scotty grew up in government housing in a small apartment with his sister his mom.   She had another husband by then. Not my dad hes my stepdad.   His stepdad is this guy named Ricky.   Who figures pretty prominently in this story.   He drank a lot. Wasnt that good a -- wasnt all that good a home. When I was like 15-16 I moved in with my grandma. And lived with my dad and my grandma. And I was into sports. I made decent grades. Now I dont even hardly go see my dad. He caught him a case I guess. Hes got several charges pending.   So when was the first time you used?   Um the first time I ever took narcotics I was 19.   According to Scotty what happened was he got kidney stones.   Never had a pain worse than that. Hurt so bad I was crying.   He mentioned it to his dad.   He had a motorcycle wreck kind of messed him up. You know he just said Here you know you can take one of my pain pills.   It was a Lortab which is hydrocodone and acetaminophen.   Yeah. He said when he took it ...   Euphoria.   Felt just total relief.   I just liked the feeling you know? Makes you feel really really good.   Not long after that ...   Getting his medicine aint gonna lie and then take it you know? Take two or three you know? And then it just you know got to experimenting more and more.   Started using Perc 30s which are definitely flooding into places like Kentucky in the early 2000s. So this is like the sort of first wave of the -- the opioid crisis.   So Scotty said at first he would just get pills from friends people at work.   And then it just you know got to well I started buying pills.   When did you feel like it crossed over from ...?   Probably my mid-'20s.   He started taking Oxycontin. And he said he was working at the time stocking bread.   Right. He was stocking bread. He was also working in a factory.   Because Id be like well Id rather work than steal off somebody. And Ive always been that way. I dont really want to steal off people.   So youre like I can work and make enough money to ...   It was really hard. I mean I made 500-600 a week and you know I wouldnt have any left.   Because he had spent all of it on pills.   And he was doing that for years. And probably it was about like 2011 or '12.   You know heroin came around and thats when I started doing it.   Because it was cheaper? Or ...   Because it was cheaper. Because I was spending 80 to 100 on two pills.   80 to 100 for just two pills?   Just two pills. You know you might get a little bit high and it might not last very long at all. And you know for 80 or 100 of heroin you can get a lot more and its a lot more powerful. So it just made sense.   And Scotty told us he -- he did heroin for like five or six years. He did not inject it but he would -- he would snort it. And he says he tried to quit a couple of times but just ...   Didnt which is probably just an excuse for I couldnt. I had to rock complete rock bottom.   And for Scotty he says that was the day of the overdoses in that apartment.   Yeah.   Can you pick up at some point where do you -- where does it start?   Youre probably gonna have to ask me like questions on this because Im gonna -- may shy back from some of it a little bit. So ask me again what you ...   Yeah yeah.   So youre living down there with Jessica and your son Gabriel?   So Jessica Scottys girlfriend. The two of them have a son together Gabriel.   Mm-hmm.   And thats her apartment. And at some point Ricky is with you guys?   Again Ricky is his stepdad.   Or like why is he over there that day?   Well I mean hes burned all his bridges.   From what we learned it sounds like he was last living with friends and like they had a falling out.   Yeah it seemed like everybody else had sort of given up on him.   We felt sorry for him. He didnt have nowhere to go. You know you can stay here a couple of days. I mean that was it.   And then I dont know. Like where would you start with that day?   Um really dont know where to go with this.    Its fine.   Im trying to not you know say very much.   I think last time we spoke it was like at some point you notice Ricky.   I can go from there probably a little bit. You know I was ...   So Scotty explained to us he and Jessica were in the living room of the apartment sitting on the couch and that at some point Ricky had gotten up and gone into the kitchen. And after a little while Scotty realized that the kitchen sink the water in the kitchen sink had been running for awhile.   And Im like why is the water running you know? So I go in there ...   Goes into the kitchen and sees Ricky standing over the kitchen sink. And he said he looked ...   Locked up.   Frozen.   Like his arms were really stiff his fists were sort of like clenched.   Bracing.   Grabbing the countertop.   With his tongue plopping back and forth in his mouth. You can -- his mouth barely open. You can see it. I kind of knew what it probably was.   Hes ODing.   I get a chair and I get him -- I struggled to get him in it. I get him in a chair and hes out. We have one of those -- not only a faucet weve got one of those spray things. I was spraying him ...   Oh that sprays for the dishes?   Yeah. And Im spraying him with cold water. I was thinking well you know that might wake him up. Im washing him in the face and I did smack him in the face a few times. He just -- he wouldnt wake up. So then I knew we had to make the decision to call the ambulance service.   What happens next?   I started getting a little bit you know out of it I guess. I dont remember a lot after that.   So Ive listened to the 911 call. And Scotty didnt really tell us this and I dont know -- I mean its not that I dont believe him but I do think there was something -- I do think that they sort of like in that moment they must have been a little like What -- what do we do next?     Because the thing is they werent the first ones to call 911 that day.     The first person to call was actually Rickys brother.     Which means someone must have called Ricky's brother told him what was going on. They did not know what to do.   Because when he calls he says something like ...     Something about outstanding warrants or like theyre worried about outstanding warrants.             And then another thing you hear in these recordings ...     Is this other call which is from one of Scotty and Jessicas neighbors.     And I think shes talking about Scotty is that Scotty had come over to her house.     She made him leave.     And from reading the reports it sounds like their one-year-old son was in the apartment at the time.   Oh whoa. Really?   Yeah their one-year-old Gabriel.   I think they were worried about the police coming and losing custody of their kid.   Hmm.   And so -- so like for them in that moment when Ricky was lying on the floor I think there was some questions in their mind like Whats the right thing to do? And how do we -- how do we do the right thing without getting ourselves in trouble?   But      They did make the call.     Jessica calls 911.   It was two minutes after Ricky's brother made that first call.         And I believe one of the reasons that they made the call that day was because they knew about this law.   I didnt know exactly what it said I did know that it came in my mind yeah well be okay.   A law that was designed to protect people in exactly this situation.     Its called the Good Samaritan law.     So around 2010 2011-12 as this opioid epidemic was escalating ...     A lot of states starting adopting these 911 Good Samaritan laws.   46 states including Kentucky now have these laws.   Which essentially say if youre using drugs with someone and that person overdoses ...     Like when the police show up you and the person who overdosed wont be charged. Youre granted immunity because you essentially did the right thing. Like you reached out for help.   The sort of like intent of the Good Samaritan law is to make people who are in the presence of a drug overdose you want these people to call for help because otherwise you know theres a greater risk that these people are just gonna die.   Hmm. Where does the Good Samaritan -- I mean it is a Christian parable right?   We got the Bible right here. So yeah it is a parable in the Gospel of Luke. So its Jesus that is telling the story. And so there is a Jew. Hes on the road to Jericho. And as he is walking along some robbers come and they steal his money and they beat him up and they leave him in a ditch and they essentially left him for dead. And then another person comes along the road. And -- but instead of helping him this person like you know crosses the road and like keeps on walking. Second person comes by same thing. And then a third person comes and its a Samaritan. And like the Jews and the Samaritans were like mortal enemies. Like they absolutely detested each other. But when this Samaritan sees this Jew lying in a ditch in need the good Samaritan stops and he helps -- helps this guy and gives his money and shelter and -- and treats his wounds and you know essentially saves his life. So its a story about like ...   Showing kindness to your enemy.   Mm-hmm. Or your enemy showing kindness to you.   Yeah right.   I guess the other thing thats interesting about this is that Jesus is talking to a legal scholar. And so its sort of about setting up like morality versus the law. And -- and so I guess what he is saying is if you see someone thats in need you dont think about what the law says you should or shouldnt do you -- you just -- you just help the person in need. Its like you know unconditional love like takes precedent over -- over the letter of the law.   But then of course there is the law.   Ronnie? Those New York reporters are here to stick a microphone in your face.   And what seems to be happening across the country is prosecutors are beginning to push back against the Good Samaritan.   Come on in guys.   Thank you.   So we talked to this guy Ronnie Goldy. He is the Commonwealth attorney and he is also the lead prosecutor in the case against Ricky Jessica and Scotty.   Its kind of weird that you guys got this from out of New York. And its just not something that I would have expected certainly. Because you know were used to our own little problems down here. And I assume youve got bigger problems in New York to deal with than -- than what we were dealing with. But thats fine. I mean Im glad that you guys got down this way.   So what did he say to you about the case?   So as Ronnie sort of explained it to us ...   You go back with our legislature and the way they have drafted the Good Samaritan law ...   The way the law is written in Kentucky is that if you call 911 for a drug overdose youre only granted immunity for two specific types of charges.   You cannot charge them with possession of controlled substance.   Drug possession.   Or possession of drug paraphernalia.   Drug paraphernalia.   Just those two charges. Well we didnt charge them with possession. We charged them with wanton endangerment.   And this is where you see this sort of pushback. Wanton endangerment that is a legal term for when you do something that puts somebody at risk for physical injury or death.   Its a conscious disregard for what could occur.   Its like driving drunk.  So in this situation ...   So by having the drugs everywhere that were laced with fentanyl you created a risk number one of the child being seriously injured or killed based on an overdose or other injuries. And also you placed paramedics law enforcement and social workers that would have to come in under that -- that circumstance.   So rather than granting Scotty Ricky and Jessica protection Ronnie Goldy Commonwealth of Kentucky has charged them with 10 counts of felony wanton endangerment. So each one of them are getting hit with 10 felony charges.   Whoa why 10?   So there was one charge for endangering the child. So like the -- the one-year-old could have gotten into the drugs somehow and -- and become exposed that way. And then there was one additional -- there were nine additional charges one for each of the -- the people that came to the house that day the police the social workers and all the EMS that responded.   And I think we should say here that Jessica who is now facing these 10 felony charges the day of the overdose she actually tested negative for opiates.   Right. And their kid checked out okay too.   But I think shes -- shes now facing these charges because essentially she -- she made that call. She was like in the apartment and made the call. The other thing to mention is that like the thing that she and Scotty were scared of which was losing custody of their son that -- that did happen.   I am not mad about that. I understand that. I understand that aspect you know? Drug stuff found in the home you know? They took him. I understand that. As far as the other things? 10 felonies? I do not understand 'em.   But Ronnies argument is that because of the number of people who had been overdosing in the community because of the local and national news reporting about heroin being laced with drugs like fentanyl and carfentanil that you can argue ...   Its a risk you knew was out there but yet youre using anyway. You should know better.   So it feels like I dont know -- I dont know if loophole is the right word but its a way in which you can still as you have said like youre precluded from bringing charges for possession of drugs and paraphernalia but like there is this sort of side door to be like Well we can charge you for this.   No thats not the case at all. Its not like were trying to say Okay we dont like the Good Samaritan law lets go around it. Thats not how I work thats not how we work.   This is the thing I dont really understand. It seems like the net effect of the Good Samaritan law is to sort of reduce fatalities and it seems like that the data I have seen its like rather successful in reducing fatalities. So you are by encouraging people to call 911 you are reducing fatalities. And in this case if they hadnt called 911 its possible that Ricky Mase the patient would have died. So in some ways I feel like ...   Sure I get it. And I totally understand it. I totally understand the reason behind it. But what I may thing morally or personally I dont have that luxury. I have a statute that I have to follow because when I took the oath of office I said I would uphold the laws of the Commonwealth. And if its a crime its a crime. I dont get to say Well but they were trying to do the right thing. If its a crime its a crime and I have to pursue it.   We actually -- we talked to another prosecutor involved in this case.   Okay.   Kim Hunt Price.   These people are victims.   She is the County Attorney who indicted Ricky Scotty and Jessica.   You know you have people whose jobs are to protect the public who have to be there. You know the message needs to go out there these people are protected as well.   But there wasnt like pressure -- people werent calling you locally or there wasnt somebody from like the state ...   No no. There was no -- like no one calling from the state or anything like that. I mean I just had my local people you know that were concerned about it. And ...   Was it the people who were there were calling you or like ...   I kind of think one of them did call me. You know and just say Is there anything we can do you know with regard to this? Is there an appropriate criminal charge?   Do you remember who that was off the top of your head?   I believe Mr. Whiteman is who did.   Okay so ...   When we talked to Scotty Whiteman we asked him essentially why was it that he wanted to see these people charged.   I view it as a call for accountability. If they are doing heroin we will get out here and we will roll around in the yard for a week. I have no issues with that. But when you do something that could cause harm to me I have got a problem with that.   I think like I understand that but ultimately also feel like that they truly did not know that like this is a drug that somebody could like brush up against or something like that and potentially have a reaction. That there is just not enough knowledge there for them to have even -- even a sense of the fact that they could be endangering other people. And then to know that you would been through this experience with this accident I always kind of felt like oh I am just surprised that -- that you would not maybe extend to them a sort of like -- I do not know if sympathy's the right word but ...   I think that if you harm someone you should be held accountable. You guys know now that Im going on vacation. You know September the 16th is a hard day.   That is the anniversary of his truck accident where he killed three people.   Is that Sunday?   Yes. Because -- yep. So Sunday I will probably lock myself in a room away from everybody for the biggest part of the morning. If Im scheduled to work on September the 16th its a day that I take off from -- from the morning 'til noon is time for me to pay my respects to them. And even though here we are coming up on 19 years later I still do that. And its just -- its just my way of dealing with it I guess.   What do you do in that moment when youre -- when you isolate yourself?   Its one of those that I reflect on that morning and I still try to figure out if there was anything that I couldve done different that may have changed the outcome. What could I have done me personally? I still have nightmares. I still wake up in cold sweats. I just ...   Im curious you mentioned this -- not yesterday I mean last time we were here that -- so initially I think there was a lawsuit filed by the family against the company but then there was a civil suit that you had to go through that you said eventually bankrupted you. And what Im wondering is like did you feel that was deserved? Do you feel like that was justified?   Yes. Yes. I took three members of that family away from them. That took potential earnings away from that family. Birthdays and Christmases missed with those that were taken that day. So yeah I feel they were very justified. I was held accountable for my actions of that morning. And then when you look at the exposure case he needs to be accountable for those actions because he knew the risks that were involved.   Right. Just as I think like getting behind the wheel of a truck you know on September 16 1999. You know there could be consequences but you never -- thats why its an accident right? It is like the same thing. If he had taken like I dont know two milligrams less of the drug its like those seem like really -- those seem like very similar situations almost. And I guess Im just like wondering like whats -- why is it hard to forgive him for that?   I didnt say I didnt forgive him for it. Its just I think he needs to be held accountable for his actions.   I mean like all of that sort of like brings us to the -- the big question in this story. What happened that day? Because if were gonna hold Scotty Hatton accountable for what happened to Scotty Whiteman you need to be able to show that the drugs in the apartment or whatever was on Rickys skin like could actually cause him to overdose.   Do you have any -- do you have any reason to doubt that?   Well the reason I found this story was it was reported as a credible report in the New York Times. Like everybody sort of acknowledged that you know first responders were going down all across the country.   So ...   But when I talked to John Cole the toxicologist from earlier he said ...   Well I dont doubt any of the symptoms that any of these fire EMS and police officers have experienced ...   He was skeptical.   Its not 100 percent clear if thats actually due to the fentanyl or to some other event that occurred in those moments.   And John Cole wasnt alone. I mean I started calling like doctors and toxicologists pharmacologists and they said that like the risk that fentanyl posed to first responders was extremely low.   Why? What was their -- what was their thinking?   Well for one I mean like the powder doesnt spontaneously aerosolize. It doesnt like poof into that air. So that makes breathing it in pretty unlikely. And as far as the skin to skin contact thing ...   Its so poorly absorbed ...   That the like substance itself doesnt pass through the skin easily.   To get fentanyl to absorb through your skin you have to use a special matrix to be able to ...   You know if you want to make a fentanyl patch you have to sort of use these solvents.   To get the absorption to even be to the point where its therapeutic let alone an overdose.   Even if you put a fentanyl patch on it takes -- takes a very long time for the drug to sort of like achieve a meaningful dose in the body.   But something is happening to these people. I mean you have to assume. So if its not the drugs what is it?   So yeah what John Cole and a couple of other people brought up was this idea that maybe it wasnt the external situation that they are in. It was more -- it was more something internal.   Theres no question in my mind that every one of these people felt symptoms that are very real.   But John said the symptoms dont -- dont really match to the symptoms of a typical opiate overdose.   For instance hyperventilating.   On opioids you are usually breathing slower.   Not breathing faster.   Or a lot of first responders reported feeling ...   A sense of great impending doom.   Opioids are all about ...   Serenity and pleasure not impending doom.   And so if you look at the symptoms and sort of the stories that are being told about these new substances and these new situations in our culture right now he says it kind of looks like a mass -- a mass panic.   So there is a condition called mass psychogenic illness.   This is something that John Cole says that he is actually come across in his work at the Minnesota Poison Control.   There was a school event and a bunch of ...   He said about four or five years ago there was this incident at a public school in Minnesota where a bunch of kids started like keeling over because they thought it was like carbon monoxide poisoning.   Subsequent student after student began to feel ill.   They took all these kids to the hospital and they gave them blood tests.   None of the blood levels were positive for carbon monoxide.   Just didnt check out.   And once the medical conditions are ruled out from a known poison you have to start considering other causes. And that event was consistent with this condition called mass psychogenic illness.   And so when you think about you know first responders showing up at the scene of a drug overdose and what is running through their mind is this like constant onslaught of news reports and other sort of anecdotal accounts they have heard about their -- their friends and their colleagues that are you know passing out.   It isnt -- it isnt that anybody is crazy or weak its that their mind is causing them to be physically ill. They really are sick. But it isnt necessarily due to the thing that they believe that it is in the moment. Does that make sense?   My response to that is ...   So we told Scotty what we knew what these scientists had been saying. And Scotty says basically like look they can say whatever they want to in their labs but this is what I went through.   I just know the effects of that day. That I came in contact with something that put me in an overdosing situation.       Hello?   Hi Ricky this is Peter Smith. Im a reporter ...   So I ended up sending a postcard to the jail because the jails dont accept letters because they are afraid of drugs getting in. And a week later I get a call from Ricky Mase. Ricky is Scottys stepfather and he is also the person who overdosed who Scotty Whiteman treated. And he told me that there wasnt -- there wasnt a whole lot of toxicology evidence or medical records or -- or much of anything really. But he had agreed to a plea deal for all 10 wanton endangerment charges.   Yes I pled guilty. I took three years. I mean I was more or less forced. That is it.   You said you were more or less forced?   Yes.   Because Ricky's a repeat felony offender he was looking at like 20 years instead of the three that he took.   Well that is the message you are putting out there is if anybody ODs then you throw them in a ditch. And you know leave them. It is the message that the court system's putting out to people. That is the way I take it.   And how -- how does that make you feel? I mean is that ...   Ah not good.   Yeah.   I mean ...   'ecause it seems like if they didnt call we wouldnt be talking right now.   Do what?   I said if they hadnt called 911 that day like the Good Samaritan law sort of says you can doesnt seem like we would be talking right now.   They did the right thing.   Yeah.   More or less. Now theyre paying for what theyve done.   Anything else you want to ask? I am sorry. I could just ramble on all day.   Unlike Ricky Scotty has refused to take a plea deal. Instead he is going to risk up to 20 years in jail by taking his case to trial.   I think about it every day. Every day at work for at least a couple hours I think about it. And the same answer comes up every day I have to take it to trial. I mean I do not -- I do not want them doing this to you know everybody man. That -- they are gonna be afraid to call 911.   I feel like for me like given the way it is gone given the way people and how they think about drugs like I just -- I dont know if I would have the same sort of confidence or conviction.   I understand where youre coming from. Thats what my lawyer says too. I think when a few things comes to light you know like they may say Well he did get sick well were gonna say Well he didnt test positive for anything. Could have been something else. Every little bit of doubt that you create is reasonable doubt to you know -- and all you gotta do is convince one person on that jury to say No Im not doing it. Thats all you gotta do.   Obviously the jury will be making a decision about the case and about what happened in the apartment that day. But I think there is sort of a bigger sort of more consequential message that they will be sending about what people like Scotty and Scotty should believe and what they should fear. And what they should do going forward.   If these charges end up getting dismissed or if it goes to trial and the people are found not guilty for wanton endangerment like how are you gonna feel?   If they are found not guilty then I am gonna trust in the judicial system that there was things that come to light that maybe I was not aware of and if they are not found guilty then so be it. And if he goes out and uses again and I am on shift when it happens and I walk in and see him guess what? I am gonna treat him. My job is to do everything within my power to save his life. And that is what I am gonna do.   And I asked the other Scotty ...   Would you make the same call? Do you think other people would make the same call like if this is whats on the end of the call potentially?   No they wont make the call. Theyll try to -- most people depending on who they are theyll probably try to just leave the person. Drag him outside or something like that you know? People in jail were saying do that. Or you know cover up everything at the crime scene or whatever you know? Or just not call. Like I said if I knew there would have been 10 felonies man I -- I dont know man. You still got to call. The guy cant die. Thats what I believe. I really believe that man.   When Scotty Hatton first got arrested for the wanton endangerment charges he spent six months in jail. After getting out he now attends church every Sunday with his family.   What are you watching? Veggie Tales?      He and Jessica actually got custody back of their son Gabriel.   You like Veggie Tales?      Thats a tomato.      Yeah. Thats a tomato.      Thats a cucumber.      And both he and Jessica    Judge I think at this point I think you need to go ahead and set a trial date out.   Have pending trials scheduled for December.
