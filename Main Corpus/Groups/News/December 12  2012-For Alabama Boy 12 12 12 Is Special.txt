 Good morning. I am David Greene. You ever jealous of people who were born on February 29? They get all the attention all the questions about what it is like to have to wait for a leap year to celebrate. Well one kid deserves some attention today. Kiam Moriya was born in 2000 at 12 minutes past noon. So this afternoon the young man can say I turned 12 at 12 on 12-12-12. He told Yahoo! News he is marking the occasion with doughnuts arranged - uh-huh - in the shape of the number 12. It is MORNING EDITION.
