 NPR's business news starts with a General Motors IPO.   Investors are awaiting the big public offering of General Motors stock on Thursday. And apparently demand is so high for a piece of the restructured and newly profitable carmaker that GM is planning to raise the share price. It was going to be around 29 now it goes up to 32. GM also may sell more stock than originally intended. This sale is critical to GM and to the U.S. government which is hoping to recover part of its 50 billion investment in the company.
