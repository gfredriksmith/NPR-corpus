 To your letters now. And we received several notes of appreciation for a pair of stories last week about the decline of Native American languages and an increase in the number of tribal radio stations.  My interview last week with Michael Kostelnik assistant commissioner for marine and air operations at U.S. Customs and Border Protection on the use of unmanned surveillance drones over the Canadian border focused in part on drug interdiction. Mr. Kostelnik's characterization of a strain of marijuana known as BC Bud drew howls of protests from some listeners.  And finally I spoke last week with author Jancee Dunn about her new book Why is My Mother Getting a Tattoo? The interview prompted many of you to send in your own stories about getting inked. I mentioned that I had a rose tattoo inked on my ankle when I turned 50. Turns out I have that in common with Kathleen Grady of Birdsboro Pennsylvania though her placement was a bit more risque than mine.  We welcome your letters and comments.
