 It is largely been known that race plays a role in who has access to the Internet. A new study suggests income and age might play even bigger roles. Among lower-income African-Americans smartphones are often a way to make up for not having a broadband connection at home. NPR's Laura Sydell reports that that might not be enough.  African-Americans who are young and college-educated are on the same footing as whites when it comes to getting online 86 percent of 18-29-year-olds have broadband at home. African-Americans are using smartphones at the same rate as whites - 56 percent - regardless of income. But Aaron Smith who did the study for the Pew Research Center says using a mobile device as a primary means of accessing the Internet has drawbacks. There is a lot you cannot do on a smartphone.  For instance you know distance learning or filling out job applications.  Those may be much more difficult to do on a smartphone than on a more traditional device.  But according to Smith on the lower end of the economic spectrum blacks trail whites when it comes to Internet access by about seven percentage points. Smith says that is a growing problem in a world in where an Internet connection is key for everything from accessing education to getting government services.  So to the extent that this particular group that has a very strong need for some of those services is much less likely to be online I think that is a very relevant finding for you know policymakers nonprofits and other people who are seeking to serve that community.  Ultimately Smith says the biggest takeaway for him from the study is that class trumps race when it comes to Internet access. Laura Sydell NPR News.
