 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Wimbledon did not host the only record-breaking competition this weekend. There was the Nathan's Annual Hot Dog Eating Contest at Coney Island where Joey Chestnut consumed a record 68 dogs in 10 minutes. The sideshow was a bun eating contest between humans and circus elephants. The pachyderms of course won. Bun eater Eric Booker told the New York Daily News If I had an elephant's trunk I could also eat a dozen buns at one time. It is MORNING EDITION.
