 The upbeat summer musical In The Heights was widely expected to lead the weekend at cinemas.    In the heights...  But it did less well than expected losing out to the third weekend of A Quiet Place Part II the pandemic's only hundred-million-dollar hit. So we asked critic Bob Mondello are audiences coming back or not?  Hollywood's been looking for signs of box office life since the start of the pandemic. And well Wonder Woman '84 was not a catastrophe. Godzilla vs. Kong sort of roared for a few days. Then with A Quiet Place II there was finally something to shout about.    Oh my...   The thriller got off to a better start than the original Quiet Place and the 101 Dalmatians spinoff Cruella did pretty well at the same time. Cue Hollywood rejoicing. But notice something about all those movies. They are star-vehicles. Do not tell me Godzilla is not a star. And they are sequels. The audience knows what it is getting. In The Heights - not so much.    I am Usnavi and you have probably never heard my name.  If you did not know Usnavi's name you were not alone. In The Heights was a Broadway hit but it closed more than a decade ago. And there were other issues - no bankable stars and musicals appeal to an older crowd that might not want to go to the multiplex during a pandemic especially when the film's streaming from Day 1. Also - and you may have gathered this from the title - In The Heights is about a neighborhood.    That is it? No story?  Lots of dancing but there is not really a plot.    The streets were made of music.  So expecting it to be a box office smash - probably wishful thinking. On the other hand when F9 opens it will not be streaming. And in China where the pandemic is largely under control it is already made a fast - and presumably furious - 200 million so let us check back in next week. I am Bob Mondello.
