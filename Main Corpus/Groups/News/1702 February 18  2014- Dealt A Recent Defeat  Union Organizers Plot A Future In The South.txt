 The United Auto Workers Union suffered a major defeat when a drive to represent workers at a Volkswagen plant in Tennessee failed last week. Right now leaders of the AFL-CIO are holding their winter meetings in Houston and that VW vote is a major topic. NPR national political correspondent Don Gonyea has more.  Make no mistake. AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka is angry about the very narrow loss for labor at Volkswagen's Chattanooga Tennessee plant. He places the blame on Republican-elected officials in the state who aggressively campaigned against the UAW even though the company did not oppose the union.  You had a governor you had the head of the legislature you had a U.S. senator saying to workers If you exercise your right we are going to take away your job.  Actually those GOP lawmakers actually threatened the loss of tax incentives for the factory if the UAW won and said a union at VW would scare away other big employers. It was anti-union hardball in a region that has long been difficult for labor. Right-to-work laws make things tough. And the South does not have the history with unions that you find in Northern industrial states and on the West Coast. Union leaders say do not blow the Chattanooga loss out of proportion. D. Taylor is president of the hotelfood and textile workers union known at UNITE HERE!. D.  I do not know why unions are given a different standard than almost any other group. You have a first try. It did not work. I mean you know Apple's first try at the Mac was not too well received. So I view it that way.  Taylor says aggressive organizing in the South by his union and others will continue. And in fact some Southern states have seen small increases in the rate of union membership though some in the region also report declines. Don Gonyea NPR News Houston.
