 Good morning. I am David Greene. College student Max Vredenburgh says he wrote a message when he was 10 years old. It included important information like hello my name is Max. I like apples. Also I like outer space. He put the letter in a bottle and threw it in the ocean in Massachusetts. It took nine years but recently someone found that bottle on a beach in France and sent Max a note in the mail. Just amazing right? - someone actually wrote a letter in 2019.
