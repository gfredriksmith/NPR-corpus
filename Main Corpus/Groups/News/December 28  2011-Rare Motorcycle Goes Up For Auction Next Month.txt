 Good morning. I am Linda Wertheimer. A rare and early motorcycle is up for auction next month. It has both pedals and a motor but no brakes or clutch. The 1906 Indian Camelback has not been ridden in 40 years and it is covered in rust. But guess what. It is also an original owned by the family which manufactured Indian cycles. This rusty wreck is likely to fetch up to 75000. It is MORNING EDITION.
