 Good morning. I am Noel King. A Mississippi pastor is proving you can find the Christmas spirit anywhere.    Pothole Christmas. It is a pothole Christmas tree.  Reverend Leon Hitchens says he wrote Pothole Christmas Tree after seeing a decorated tree sticking out of a traffic cone put there as a festive way to call attention to a pothole. It has drawn crowds and inspired Hitchens to ask what are you doing to spread Christmas joy?
