 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin with an important announcement. The Centers for Disease Control says it is safe to dress your chickens up for Halloween. This comes after a news outlet reported a salmonella outbreak and said dressing a chicken in a costume could spread harmful bacteria. The CDC corrected the record although with this addendum - you can put your poultry in whatever get-up you want to tonight but resist the urge to snuggle your chicken with your face. And kissing is really off-limits. It is MORNING EDITION.
