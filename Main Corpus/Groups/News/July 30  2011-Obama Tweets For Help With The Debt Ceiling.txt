 President Obama set off a torrent of tweets yesterday when he asked Americans to send messages to Congress about the debt limit. There was a range of reactions on Twitter. KelseyWho tweeted The president while I appreciate your efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise on the deficit you are clogging' up my news feed. Stop. Hard to imagine anyone saying that to George Washington. Lisa Elstrum tweeted Many Republican representatives no more time for the blame game. Americans want compromise. Man up. We the people. But the Republican National Committee tweeted the president requesting that people spam members of Congress is not the same as having a debt plan of your own. Dan H. noticed the twitter stream from the White House and wrote I feel bad for the intern that is typing all of Barack Obama tweets today. Tweets are short messages limited to 140 characters. Lots of people say they cannot say anything important at so short a length. But you probably could not get Congress to raise the tweet limit in time.   And this is NPR News.
