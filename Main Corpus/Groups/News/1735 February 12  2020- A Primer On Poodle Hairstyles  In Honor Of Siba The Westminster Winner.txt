 Hardcore dog-loving listeners already saw the results on Fox Sports. But in case you missed it last night the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show crowned a champion.   The best in show goes to the standard poodle.   Yes. Yes.  Siba takes it all.  Siba the standard poodle looks well pretty much how you would expect a show poodle to look. Her black fur is carefully groomed into a fluffy top knot on her head and her chest legs and tail feature perfectly shaved tufts of hair called pompons.  Siba looks like she stepped out of an 18th century French aristocrat sitting room. That poodle style is unmistakable. But why are poodles groomed that way?   What is with the little plumber butt thing happening on the hips there?   These pompons are keeping Butch's hips warm from the cold water - the hip joints. It is very important.   And the little drummerette things you were saying on that...   Right we keep...   Those act as flippers.  No poodle pompons are not used as flippers but the mockumentary Best In Show did get it half right.  To keep its internal organs as well as its joints warm.  Brandi Hunter of the American Kennel Club says poodles were bred to be great retrievers. Their curly coats were shorn down to pompons not because it made them look so very fancy but because it made them faster swimmers while protecting vital organs.  A lot of people think that oh it is a really prissy dog. It does not like to get dirty. It is actually quite the contrary. It is actually a very versatile dog and it is been used as everything from a herder to a retriever to a circus act dog. It is really got that kind of versatility and that kind of look and they are really loved by the American public.  Now Siba's owners have already announced her retirement so she is probably not going to jump into a freezing lake to retrieve a freshly shot duck anytime soon. But do not think she would not. It is clearly in her blood and her hair.
