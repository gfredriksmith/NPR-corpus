 And top TV executives are in Switzerland today bidding for U.S. rights to broadcast the next two Olympic games - Russia in 2014 and Brazil in 2016. The competition is wide open because of the recent resignation of Dick Ebersol. As the head of NBC Sports he was the man who led NBC to dominance over the games.  Basically the entire marketplace shifted somewhat when Dick Ebersol resigned. Everyone recalculated what it would take when and where they stood in the pecking order now that Dick Ebersol was out of the process.  Tripp Mickle is following this multibillion dollar bidding war for the publication SportsBusiness Journal. He says whoever wins NBC Comcast ESPN and parent company Disney or Fox will likely see more live broadcasts of Olympic events.  I think probably what we are going to be looking at is some type of hybrid.  The International Olympic Committee is also hearing bids to broadcast the games in 2018 and 2020 - locations as yet unknown. Officials are expected to announce a winner this week.
