 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Play-Doh made history. The company says it persuaded the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to take the rare step of trademarking a smell the aroma of Play-Doh. The company offered a description of the scent that is worthy of a wine tasting. It is said to be a sweet slightly musky vanilla fragrance with slight overtones of cherry. It is not clear who if anyone was trying to steal the scent. But there is if you want it a Play-Doh-scented cologne. It is MORNING EDITION.
