 The pandemic meant that a lot of state fairs were canceled this year and state fair foods too - the funnel cakes the fried Oreos the Italian ices. And then this guy and his sister got an idea.  My name is Josh Zamansky. I am founder and CEO of statefairtogo.com. And I actually credit my sister with coming up with the idea of this DIY-style meal kit of fair foods for families.  When the Minnesota State Fair canceled Zamansky figured look you can get everything else to go at this point so why not state fair food? He started in Minnesota. Then he expanded his venture into Texas.  Zamansky has a background in catering corporate events. And he says this is not just about indulging in fair food - although it certainly is about that. State fairs are big business for local economies.  Minnesota's attendance in 2019 was a little over 2 million. Texas was closer at 2.5 million.  Zamansky teams up with fair vendors to include items they would have sold during a normal year. So what is in a meal kit?  A pound of Fernie's funnel cake mix 2-pound turkey leg from Farm Pac Kitchens 1 12 dozen fried Oreos over a pound of fried okra and creamed gravy with a pound and a half of seasoned curly fries and five corn dogs from the Dock restaurant.  How many calories is that? Zamansky did not have an exact number. He just says...  Quite a few .  Quite a few.
