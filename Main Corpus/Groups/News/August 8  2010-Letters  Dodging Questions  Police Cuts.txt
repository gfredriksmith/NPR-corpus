 Last week I spoke with David McClure from the Office of Citizen Services and Communications at the General Services Administration. The agency recently unveiled a redesign of its website USA.gov and the site's app store.  Our story on how the tough economy is hurting police departments in rural communities and small towns generated many responses at NPR.org.  We also heard from many of you regarding our story on human trafficking in the U.S. which profiled one woman who came from east Africa and worked almost 100 hours a week for only 70 a month.  Why did these people do this to me? It really make me sad when I remember this story.  Write to us. Visit our website NPR.org and click on the Contact Us link.
