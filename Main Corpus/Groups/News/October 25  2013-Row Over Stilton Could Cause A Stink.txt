 Good morning. I am David Greene. In the British village of Stilton they have made a cheese called Stilton since the 18th century a tradition as old as our country. But in Britain a couple of centuries - whatever. The government has told a pub in Stilton that it cannot call its cheese Stilton. The name is protected by EU law which says true Stilton cheese can come from three specific regions - not Cambridgeshire where Stilton is located. The pub's landlord is weighing his legal options. He could cause a stink. It is MORNING EDITION.
