 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. A classic piece of James Bond memorabilia could soon be yours though when the sleek silver Aston Martin driven by Sean Connery in Goldfinger goes on auction this fall it is expected to fetch millions. The car dates to the '60s but is in near-perfect condition. This Aston Martin comes with revolving license plates a bullet-proof shield and machine guns that pop out of the headlights. The parts really work even if the guns do not shoot. It is MORNING EDITION.
