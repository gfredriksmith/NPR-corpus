 OK so while Rick Santorum is enjoying a lead in the Michigan polls he did have to do some damage control last night after a comment made by a very important supporter. Foster Friess has contributed to hundreds of thousands of dollars to a superPAC that supports Santorum and yesterday Mr. Friess appeared on MSNBC. He weighed in on the debate over the new Obama administration rules for contraceptive health care coverage.   And this contraceptive thing my gosh it is such inexpensive - you know back in my days they used Bayer aspirin for contraceptives. The gals put it between their knees and it was not that costly.  Host Andrea Mitchell was speechless for several seconds. People on Twitter and Facebook were not speechless at all. Mr. Friess' remark prompted an avalanche of remarks about how people would never regard aspirin quite the same way again. Santorum went on Fox News later where he called the comment a bad off-color joke. And today Foster Friess apologized in a blog post asking forgiveness from those who found the remark offensive.
