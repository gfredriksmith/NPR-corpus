 Keep it snappy - that is what social media is all about. Tweets 140 characters Snapchat video no more than a handful of seconds. You can even catch quick music hits here and there. And now a classical concerto distilled to mere seconds.   Avi Avital is the classical mandolinist performing this concerto. It is just 75 seconds long.  So the InstaConcerto like we  name it it is not even a miniature. It is like a micro- a nano-miniature.  A micro-nano-miniature concerto but still one with five distinct movements. Avital has been posting one movement to his Instagram account every day this week.   This - this is what he posted Tuesday.   It ends and everybody goes oh oh - is that it? Ah - oh I want more.  That is Peter Breiner who composed the concerto. He is hoping to reach people who might not be classical music listeners.  Who never experienced this before and have the feeling oh it is actually nice.  And since these are so short we can probably fit in one more movement.
