 Whether self-isolating solo with roommates or with family these are stressful times for all of us. And we know music can help bring some relief. That is why last week we asked you to let us know what songs you turn to to help keep anxiety at bay and this weekend we are playing some of your suggestions. First up a track recommended by someone who goes by the Twitter handle swingtheblues . The song is called Go Bang  by British musician and producer Subtract .   That was Go Bang by the artist Subtract. You can still add to our special anti-anxiety playlist. If you have got a song that helps you relieve stress tell us about it. Just tweet us - npratc - and use the hashtag nostressplaylist. And we will hear more of your music picks tomorrow.
