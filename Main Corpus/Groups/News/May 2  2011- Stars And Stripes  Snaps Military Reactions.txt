 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Shock and awe a new interpretation of a familiar phrase. That is the reaction reported in Stars and Stripes from U.S. service members to the death of Osama bin Laden. Photos on the military newspaper's website are from Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan. One shows troops solemnly watching the news. Another shows a brigadier general who was at the Pentagon on 911 shaking hands with another officer both smiling broadly. It is MORNING EDITION.
