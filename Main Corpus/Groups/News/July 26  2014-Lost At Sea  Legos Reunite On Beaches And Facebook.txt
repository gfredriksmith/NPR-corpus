 You are listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. Nearly two decades ago a massive wave struck the Tokio Express a container ship with nearly 5 million Legos on board. The colorful toy blocks poured into the ocean and are still washing-up on shores today. Tracey Williams and her children first encountered the Legos near her family home in the late 1990s. We spoke with her this week about a Facebook page she created where she and other collectors can share their finding.  Well what happened is I forgot all about the Lego for a while. I moved away from the sea. And in 2010 I moved back to Newquay. And I was amazed to see that very same Lego was still washing up now 17 years since it all spilled into the ocean. And I just was astonished. And I am part of a beach cleaning group here in England. And I started to see other bits of Lego on other people's Facebook pages. And I was intrigued. And I thought it would be actually quite interesting from a scientific point of view to monitor where it was all turning up and what was turning up and in what quantities and who would found it.  What kind of condition are the Legos in?  Well worryingly they are perfect. Some of them are a bit broken. I mean the thing is with Lego it is indestructible really is not it so? But that is worrying in it is own right is not it? Because it is still out there in the ocean and it is still washing in literally every day.  Do you have any indication from your Facebook page or other avenues as to how far away some of these Tokio Express Legos have reached?  Well we know it is washing up around Devon and Cornwall. It is washing up in Wales  too and also in Ireland. And I have had a report in the last couple of days - which I have not yet verified - that it is been found in Holland. And I have also been contacted by somebody in Australia who is found one of the little blue flippers on the strand line there. And obviously we do not know whether it is from our same cargo. But apparently oceanographers tell me it is perfectly feasible after 17 years that this Lego could actually have gone around the world.  You do not often hear a sentence like this - this Lego could have gone around the world.  What is interesting is that it highlights the whole issue. I think of marine debris although it is quite fun to find a bit of Lego there are so many cargo spills every year. And we are picking up intravenous bags at the moment from the cargo spill in 2007.  Yeah. So I am guessing that since the late 1990s your children might have - not that we ever outgrow Legos but I am guessing...  I do not think anybody outgrows Legos. The enthusiasm from the Facebook page and the delight people express when they find it and - somebody was saying this morning - a lady who is got children of her own - grown-up children. She still says she has to do a happy dance every time she finds a bit of Lego on the beach.  Tracey Williams who created the Facebook page Lego Lost at Sea. Thanks so much for being with us.  It is a pleasure.
