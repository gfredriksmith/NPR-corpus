 Now we do not know if Daddy Warbucks was a hedge fund manager but we do know that in today's last word in business we have Daddy Warbucks and the mop-headed orphan he befriends in the long-running comic strip Orphan Annie because the two made their final appearance yesterday.  The comic's owner Tribune Media Services pulled the strip from newspapers. It seems that the gutsy girl and her rich industrialist benefactors were not hedge fund managers. They were not making enough money. In recent years the comic appeared in less than 20 newspapers.  That is unlike the 1940s when the comic was in hundreds of papers. It was so popular that when newspaper deliverymen went on strike in 1945 the Mayor of New York City Fiorello LaGuardia read the comic on the radio so fans would not miss out. Mayor  Now you know poor little Annie the orphan is on trial for murder. And what a trial it is. Oh the nice society people you know? Oh the nice society people that know so much.  But in today's world characters never die. They find new licensing opportunities. Annie's current owner says its character - who symbolizes perseverance in the face of difficulty - may be exiting the world of traditional print newspapers but she will push on into the world of new media as in mobile devices - that would be a cell phone and e-readers.  She will also live on on Broadway. The musical Annie is slated for revival in 2012.  Unidentified Child  Tomorrow tomorrow I love you tomorrow...  And that is the business news on PR News. I am Steve Inskeep.  And I am Deborah Amos.  Unidentified Child  Tomorrow tomorrow I love you tomorrow. You are always a day...
