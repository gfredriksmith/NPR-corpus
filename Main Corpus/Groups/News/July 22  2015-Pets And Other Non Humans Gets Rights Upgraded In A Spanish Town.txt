 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. The Declaration of Independence says all men are created equal. It took a civil war to show it really meant all men and generations to make it all men and women. Now a small town in Spain has taken another step. The town council in Trigueros de Valle declared that all residents are born equal. That includes pets. Quote a resident whether human or non-human is entitled to respect so bullfighting is out. It is not clear if dogs and cats get to vote. It is MORNING EDITION.
