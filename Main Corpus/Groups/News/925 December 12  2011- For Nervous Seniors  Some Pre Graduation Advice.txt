 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. December means one thing for most college students a break from studying. But for seniors with only one semester of school left this is the time to start thinking and often to start worrying about entering the job market. Author and professor Mitchell Zuckoff understands this fear and he uses this time to prepare his students for what the real world is like. He has this essay on the advice he gives to anxious seniors.  I taught my last class of the semester the other day. Inevitably my students - all of them journalism majors and most of them seniors - hijacked the lesson plan to vent their hopes and fears about what awaits them after graduation. This happens every December. Any every December I do my best to calm and encourage them to let them know it is OK to be worried but it is not OK to despair.  I give them what I have come to consider my pre-commencement address. By May they will be overwhelmed with advice distracted by pomp and circumstance and exhausted from senior week. Any wisdom from whatever celebrity speaker my university invites to graduation will waft over them and be carried away. If you ask me six months before we stamp them fully assembled is our last real chance to get them ready for what is next to advise our smart hardworking and in many cases privileged students how to duck tuck and roll when they jump into the world with the parachutes we have helped them to sew. So when the final class of the fall semester turns to the future I give them practical advice about getting hired and succeeding in journalism. More importantly I tell them some hard truths about life. First I tell them to imagine a career ladder whose first rung is about six feet off the ground. That is the reality in many fields where the perks be they prestige excitement money or best of all meaningful work attract more applicants than there are jobs. It is always been this way I explain and they should embrace it rather than complain about it. They will either need a leg up to reach that first rung or they will have to develop the strength that is the experience the skills the drive the desire to pull themselves up on their own. I am a big fan of that second approach having lived it but I also tell them to take a boost onto the ladder if it is offered without confusing what they have earned with what they have been given. Then I tell them to spend the last semester of college weaning themselves from the good life and the safety net many of them enjoy. Professors and university staff who care about their development and well being friends nearby and available at all hours flexible schedules and relatively small consequences for a lost assignment or a missed class. I tell them that outside of the small circle close to them they should not expect people to care. I tell them to use this time to steel themselves before they start their job searches in earnest to accept the fact that being overlooked or underestimated is part of life that someone else will get a job they deserve or think they deserve that they will face anxieties about money and about love and about where to live and about whether they chose the right field and about whether they are good enough or smart enough or tough enough to succeed. Last I tell them to keep in touch because I know how good they are and how smart they are and how much the world needs them even if no one knows it yet.
