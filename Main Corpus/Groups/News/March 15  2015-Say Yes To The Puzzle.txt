 This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I am Rachel Martin. Star Wars is getting its first spinoff movie. Disney announced there will be a Frozen 2. But around here we will not make you wait for more of what you really want because it is time for the puzzle. Joining me now is Will Shortz. He is the puzzle editor of The New York Times. He is also WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master. Hey there Will.  Good morning Rachel.  So I want to acknowledge. You are a pretty big deal in the world of puzzling and beyond really. And you are often featured in news articles but I understand this past week you were featured in a pretty big publication not for puzzling.  Yeah. Did you see this? It was the March 9 issue of Sports Illustrated - the back page.  That is amazing.   If I listed you know 10 magazines that might profile me you would probably not guess Sports Illustrated.   I mean puzzling can be - it is a sport. It can be very physical. But you were in Sports Illustrated because you are of course also a famed table tennis player right?  Table tennis. Yes. And the writer did a great job.  That is very cool. Remind us about the puzzle - the challenge from last week. What was it?  Yes I said take a familiar phrase in the form blank and blank put the second word in front of the first one and you will name a come part of a large company. What is it? Well the answer was room and board and you make that switch you get boardroom.  Around 750 of you submitted the right answer but there can be only one winner. And the winner is Vince Joy of Jamestown N.Y. who joins is now on the line. Hey Vince. Congratulations.  Thanks Rachel. Hi Will.  Hey there.  So did this come pretty quickly to you? Did you have to sit on it for a few days?  Yeah. It was funny. I was mulling it over and my phone rang. And it was one of my cohorts from work calling me about a meeting. And I asked if I was going to meet in her office. And she said no we are going to meet in the boardroom.  Oh for God's sake.  And I said boardroom. Oh boardroom room and board. That is it.  Really? I understand that - this has happened a couple weeks in a row - you are not the first person in your family to win.  No actually about five years ago my mom had sent in like two puzzles and got called.  Oh that is cool.  And unfortunately she passed away last year.  Oh I am sorry.  I was going through some of her old stuff and I found her old WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin.  No way. Ah that is cool.  And then two days later you called.  And we will send you another lapel pin to match.  Looking forward to it.  OK Vince are you ready to do this? You want to give it a shot?  I am ready.  All right Will we are ready. Let us do it.  All right Vince and Rachel you know yes is supposed to be the most pleasing word in the English language. And if that is true today's puzzle will be very pleasing indeed. Every answer is an anagram of yes plus two or three other letters. For example if I said yes plus A-S. You would say essay.  OK.  OK. All right.  Number one is yes plus L-T.  Yes plus L-T.  Is there a category to these? Or is it just anything?  Just anything.  Just anything.  Style.  Style is it. That is what you have. Number two is yes plus K-P. P as in Peter.  Oh wow pesky.  Yeah.  Pesky. I also would have accepted Skype. OK. Yes plus A-Q-U.   Queasy.  That is it. Yes plus F-I-T. F as in Frank. T as in Thomas.  Oh feisty.  You are getting good at these. Yes plus C-H-P. C as in Charles. P as in Peter.  Oh let us see.  Oh.  Oh Rachel I am impressed. You got this 'ecause it...  Psyche.  Yes.  Psyche. I am impressed. Nice going. Yes plus E-J-R.  E-J-R. How about New Jersey?  Jersey.  Love it.  I am just shouting out to my New Jersey friends.  Totally.  Yes plus O-P-R and the middle letter is P as in Peter.  O-P-R.  I think it is a bird.  Oh nice going Rachel.  Oh like an Osprey?  Yeah.  Osprey.  Thank you Rachel.  You bet Vince. I feel like we have got a good thing going right now Vince. Good team.  There you go. And here's your last one. Yes plus I-L-M. M as in Mary.  Smiley?  There you go. Smiley.  Yes. Smiley.  I was afraid you were going to give me one with like 15 letters afterwards.  I know it is always dangerous when he is like yes plus a few letters.   But you did fabulously Vince.
