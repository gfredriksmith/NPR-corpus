 Good morning. I am David Greene. You ever wonder why it took a big snowstorm to close school and on beautiful sunny days there we are sitting in a classroom? Well enter Bob Sampson. He is the principal at Bellingham Christian School in Washington state and he canceled school today to quote celebrate an exceptionally nice day. The forecast there 68 and sunny. No resentment here in the dark studio all of us at work. Nope not jealous because it is always sunny at MORNING EDITION.
