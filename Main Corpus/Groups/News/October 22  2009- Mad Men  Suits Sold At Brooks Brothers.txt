 We have a fashion tip now for those businessmen who still have some money to spend. It involves Brooks Brothers which is famous for old style men's suits. Now the retailer is modernizing its look dragging Brooks Brothers' style all the way forward into the 1960s.   Yeah that is music from the hit television show Mad Men. It features 1960s ad executives working and misbehaving in all those sharp Kennedy-era outfits. For the next few weeks Brooks Brothers is offering 250 limited edition suits based on the cable TV show. The suit is grey two-buttoned with slant pockets and narrow lapels. The 998 suit promotes both Brooks Brothers and the TV program which is only fitting for a show about advertising.
