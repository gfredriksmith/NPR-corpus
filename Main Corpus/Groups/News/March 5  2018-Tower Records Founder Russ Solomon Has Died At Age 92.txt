 The founder of Tower Records has died. Russ Solomon was 92 years old. He started selling records in his father's drugstore and built a chain that was mecca for many in the days when you bought music by flipping through the albums or tapes in a bin. Here's NPR's Anastasia Tsioulcas.  Russ Solomon opened his first stand-alone store in 1960 in Sacramento Calif. By its peak in the 1990s Tower had nearly 200 stores in places as far-flung as Tokyo and London with sales of more than 1 billion. Music nerds loved Tower because you could find everything there decades before streaming services made access to music instant. Bruce Springsteen raved about the story in All Things Must Pass director Colin Hanks' 2015 documentary about the chain.   If you came into town you went to Tower Records.  But in 2006 Tower declared bankruptcy. Solomon and his team did not foresee the digital revolution. People were starting to buy downloads. File-sharing sites like Napster were becoming common. And big-box stores like Walmart and Best Buy sold popular CDs on big discounts. Tower Records just could not compete. Even after his chain's collapse Russ Solomon could not stay away from the album bins. Before he finally retired he and his wife ran a little record store back in Sacramento for a few years. His motto was no music no life. Anastasia Tsioulcas NPR News New York.
