 Record heat in Washington and Oregon is hurting agriculture on two fronts - both the people who harvest crops and the crops themselves. Here's Anna King from the Northwest News Network.   Central Washington farmer Alan Schreiber is worried about his...  Melon watermelon tomatoes eggplant okra - what you call hot crops. But they need a lot of water.  Schreiber just found out his irrigation pump is only running at 30 capacity. And it is 117 degrees out.   His new water pump will not arrive until Friday. So now he is having to make some hard choices.  We have stopped watering our perennial crops. So we are not watering our tree fruit grapes and berry crops.  He says those fruits can hold up with less water. Across the Northwest agriculture is stressed. Blueberries are ripening so fast processors cannot keep up. Potatoes a valuable Northwest crop are growing in weird shapes making them hard to cut into french fries. Dairy cows produce less milk when overheated. So operators are misting them with water and turning giant fans on them. Of course most in peril are the humans. Some workers are picking cherries at night under floodlights. Gonzalo Rodriguez is a farmworker supervisor. He says after early morning work his farm workers hide in air-conditioned housing watching TV napping or calling family.  You really get tired when you wake up at 4 you start to work at 5 and you finish at 10 or 11 or maybe noon. And then what you want and need is to eat and sleep.  The region expects to continue seeing temperatures above 100 degrees into next week. For NPR News I am Anna King outside of Eltopia Wash.
