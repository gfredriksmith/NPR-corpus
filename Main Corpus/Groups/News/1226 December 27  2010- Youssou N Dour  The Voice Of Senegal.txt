 He is also one of NPR's 50 Great Voices. Banning Eyre tells us why.  Most people's first blast of Youssou N'Dour came in 1986 with the song In Your Eyes by Peter Gabriel.   .  But for Senegalese N'Dour was already a superstar. Latin music was the rage there when N'dour's first band Etoile de Dakar released this song Thiely. Listen to 20-year-old N'Dour on the lead vocal comparing his lover to a free bird beautiful but elusive.   .  A new style mbalax was on the rise. Rooted in local African rhythms mbalax would allow N'Dour's voice to soar with a whole new freedom.   .  Over the years N'Dour has shape-shifted his sound to accommodate soul funk progressive rock reggae and even religious Islamic music. It has not always been a smooth ride but N'Dour has remained on top without question Senegal's most beloved singer.   .  And when he did get his international break he sidestepped Paris and set course for London and an alliance with Peter Gabriel.    .  N'Dour's art-rock phase proved disappointing exciting neither his home crowd nor his growing international audience. But he bounced back with a million-selling duet with Neneh Cherry and he perfected the art of releasing mbalax albums for the Senegalese and more experimental works for the world.   .  Placating such different audiences has proved tricky. N'Dour's religious album Egypt was at first poorly received in Senegal. Islamic leaders took offense and the public seemed to want him to keep his beats on the dance floor. But when Egypt won a Grammy Award N'Dour came out a hero.   .  For NPR News I am Banning Eyre.
