 This summer we are checking in on what music is topping the charts. And today we are hearing Kenny Chesney. His new album is called Welcome to the Fishbowl.   Welcome to the Fishbowl hits the downside of fame though the album's success is not likely to bring the country star any less of it. It debuted as the second-most popular album in the United States - not just country but all music - behind only Justin Bieber's Believe. Another song from the new album is about a breakup though it is less sad than steamy.   There is something about Kenny Chesney. I mean he is sexy.  That is our guide to the charts music journalist Danyel Smith.   Guys want to be like Kenny Chesney. I think you know women are hoping a wink from Kenny Chesney.   I think this is when he is at his best when he is sort of asking something or explaining something but he is not preachy or gooey-ooey or anything like that.   It is just really kind of dude-ish. It is really kind of manly. And it is kind of great.  Danyel Smith is talking of Kenny Chesney who is on tour right now with Tim McGraw selling out stadiums. Some call it the summer hunk-fest. We will take you out on their duet called Feel like a Rock Star.   This is NPR News.
