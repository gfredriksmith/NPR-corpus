 Caitlin Kenney of our Planet Money team has this report on what is setting investors on edge.  You know how when you live next door to someone who does not really clean their yard or has a bunch of junked up cars out front it is harder to sell your house? It turns out the same is true for countries. This is basically what is happening to Italy right now. Their neighbors - Greece Ireland and Spain they have got a bunch of bad mortgages and failed banks in their yards and that is making things really hard for Italy.  Italy may be a better house than some of these other European countries. But it is difficult to be the Italian house in this deteriorating European neighborhood.  This is Andrew Balls head of European Portfolio Management at manages one of the world's biggest bond funds. You can think of Andrew Balls as a prospective buyer of Italy's house. And overall he says the house looks pretty good.  Italy has not been getting worse. Yes they have a high level of debt but it is not been going up.  The problem is that potential buyers like Andrew Balls are worried about things happening next door or down the block from Italy. They just do not trust that the other homeowners European policymakers are doing enough to take care of the neighborhood. They have seen how these leaders have handled Greece's problems and well they are not impressed  You have public arguments between Germany and the European Central Bank. You had huge disagreements with different countries over how to deal with this Greece situation. Naturally you look at this you wonder if they have this much trouble dealing with Greece what happens if this spreads?  The way Italian journalist Beppe Severgnini sees it Germany is the one in charge.  You never have to forget Italy is a bright very lively but young girl. And she really needs a nanny. And we have a German nanny up in Frankfurt thanks God who will sometimes tell us what to do.  Caitlin Kenney NPR News.
