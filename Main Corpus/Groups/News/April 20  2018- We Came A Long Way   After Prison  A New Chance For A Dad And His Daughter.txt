  And it is time for StoryCorps this morning. Today a daughter talks with her dad about a confusing time. When 17-year-old Abby Gagliardo was a kid her dad Ralph was sent to prison. He is been out for five years now. And at StoryCorps Abby talked with her dad.  When I was a kid people would ask me. They would be like where is your dad? And I would be like I do not know - jail? I did not understand any of it.  You never knew it was all related to heroin. A.  Honestly no. I found out last year from my sister. I was like what are you talking about? My dad never did heroin. And she was like just ask him. So I did. And you told me you were addicted to heroin for 10 years. That was shocking to me. R.  Did it all of a sudden make sense to you like why I was going to jail? A.  I thought it was for stealing. R.  Yeah. Well that is part of it. Kind of go to extreme measures because you always need money. So you just thought I was a crook? A.  I was young. I did not put two and two together. And looking back on things I thought I had a normal life. You know? I ate spaghetti for dinner. I watched TV. I went to bed at 8. R.  Yeah. I tried to send you letters that would give us a connection. Like one time I traced my hand on a piece of paper and I told you to trace yours. A.  Did I? R.  Yeah you did. And you sent it back. A.  But it is like talking to someone through a wall. Back then I could not see you know the dumb faces you make now or hear your laugh when I make a silly joke or see the way your forehead has funny lines in it when you talk. There is a difference and I can feel it. R.  But when I came home you were a little hostile. A.  I was pissed. It is was like how can you come in here and act like the parent? You have to give me a reason to give you a chance. R.  Yeah. There was definitely some bumps in the road. And it was my fault that you did not have a father there. A.  But I have one now and that is what counts. You know? I know you are not just going to disappear out of the blue. R.  You are getting me all choked up. I am sorry. A.  . It took some time but I mean look at us now. You are the one person in the world I can open up to and trust. We came a long way and I am proud of both of us.
