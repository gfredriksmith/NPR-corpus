 And today's last word in business 'Tis the season for shopping days with names.  It is not just Black Friday anymore. With stores opening earlier and earlier Black Friday is fast becoming Black Thursday. You might still go out and bargain hunt on Friday but be warned there is no rest for you on Saturday. There is now Small Business Saturday when shoppers are encouraged to buy from local stores.  Sunday is at least for now a day of rest but after that it is back to buying. Cyber Monday a term coined by the National Retail Federation is the day for big online discounts.  If you missed them no worries. Grab your smartphone and prepare for Mobile Tuesday a day of deals only available through mobile devices. Mobile Tuesday has some competition however. Charitable organizations are organizing Giving Tuesday to encourage people to donate some of their time or gifts to those in need.  Which brings us to next Wednesday which we suggest be dubbed Wrap Up Wednesday. After all that shopping should not you be done by now? And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
