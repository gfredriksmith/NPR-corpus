 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. It started out as a mix-up but now it is something to be grateful for. In 2016 Jamal Hinton received a text from grandmother Wanda Dench inviting him to Thanksgiving dinner. Thing is she is not his grandma. It was the wrong number. When Hinton asked if he could still come Dench said of course because that is what grandmas do. The two are no longer strangers. They have continued the tradition each Thanksgiving and plan to meet again this year.
