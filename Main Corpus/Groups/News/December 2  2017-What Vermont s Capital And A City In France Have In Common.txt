 What the L is going on? Montpellier France ordered jerseys for its professional soccer club. But when the jerseys were unpacked there was just one L in the town's name not two - penalty on the manufacturer. But Montpellier city officials did not despair - they donated. They sent the one-L jerseys to the city of Montpelier - one L - Vt. where they will be auctioned to raise money for the Montpelier High School Athletic Department and other charities including a church in Ghana. That is where Noel Riby-Williams a Montpelier senior and soccer player was born she told TV station WCAX.   It is just great that out of a little kindness another little kindness happens. And if everybody in the world just spread kindness the world would be such a better place.  You know it sounds as if both Montpellier and Montpelier are going to have great seasons.
