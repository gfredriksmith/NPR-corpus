 Good morning. I am Noel King. Some runners are using those GPS tracking apps that trace their roots to make art. So they will run a route that is the shape of a dog or a face. When the Boston Marathon was postponed because of COVID-19 Lindsay Devers decided to run alone and to use her run to write a message of hope. She finished the entire 26.2 miles and realized she was missing the N but I guess Boston Strog  also gets the message across.
