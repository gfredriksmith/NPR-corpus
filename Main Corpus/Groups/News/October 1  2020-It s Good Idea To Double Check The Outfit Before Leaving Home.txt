 Good morning. I am David Greene. These days it is perfectly acceptable to wear pajama pants while working from home. No if you are about to ask me do not. Anyway it is generally assumed if you do have to run to the office you will put something over those pajama pants. Well poor Dr. Vera Etches - she is Ottawa's medical officer of health. And after a very hectic morning she made it all the way to city hall before realizing she forgot to put a skirt on under her raincoat. The busy doctor tweeted yikes time for another break. It is MORNING EDITION.
