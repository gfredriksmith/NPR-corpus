 It is a bit early to break out cigars but Lonesome George the last known Galapagos giant tortoise may soon become a father. George is the only known living Geochelone nigra Abingdoni tortoise in the world. He is estimated to be between 90 and 100 years old which scientists say is actually the sexual peak for giant tortoises who can live to be 150. George resides in the Galapagos National Park. Because he is in the description of the Guinness Book of World Records the rarest living creature he is a difficult man to find a mate for. Scientists have been playing Match.com for Lonesome George since 1993 and have put two females of different subspecies into his pen. But I guess he preferred to watch ESPN. George aroused scientists almost as much as himself last year by mating for the first time during the 36 years that he is been in captivity. But the eggs of his partner turned out to be infertile. But the national park says that Lonesome George has recently awarded his seal of approval if you please to the eggs of another partner. Result is being cared for in an incubator. Scientists will know if there will be a little Not-As-Lonesome-George - or Georgia - within 120 days. And if so that would make George one of the oldest natural fathers on record.
