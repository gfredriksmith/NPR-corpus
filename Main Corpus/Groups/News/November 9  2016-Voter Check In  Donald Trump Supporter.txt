 All right overnight we called back some of the voters we met this fall while traveling the divided states of this country. And one was farmer Jon Jackson from outside Milledgeville Ga.  I am extremely excited exhausted. I probably should have talked to my doctor first before I watched this.  Mr. Jackson...  .  Mr. Jackson is a veteran. And Trump's regular promises to take care of veterans won his support.  You know so many people are quick to - you know to strike the hammer and say hey let us go and fight. But when we come back home they are not so quick to take care of us.  That is Jon Jackson from just outside of Milledgeville Ga. He is one of the voters we met in our Divided States Project throughout this fall. We are hearing from them throughout this morning.
