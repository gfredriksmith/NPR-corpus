 Hang in there guys. We are also tracking the political effects of the shootings. The timing could not have been worse for advocates of gun legislation in Michigan. As we reported yesterday Michigan lawmakers approved a proposal to expand places where people could carry concealed weapons. That list included schools and daycare centers. Yesterday afternoon the state's Republican governor Rick Snyder vetoed the bill. Snyder said he vetoed the legislation because it would not allow individual places to opt out of the new rules. He also cited the shootings on Friday.
