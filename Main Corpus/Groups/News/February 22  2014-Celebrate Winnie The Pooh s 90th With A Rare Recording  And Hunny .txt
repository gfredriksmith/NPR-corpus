 Ninety years ago this month Alan Alexander Milne published a short poem called Teddy Bear in Punch a famous British humor magazine. That teddy bear went on to become perhaps the most famous in the world Winnie-the-Pooh. Before he was a book of stories for children Winnie-the-Pooh was a real stuffed bear beloved by A.A. Milne's young son Christopher. In 1929 the Dominion Gramophone Co. recorded A.A. Milne reading from his book of children's verse When We Were Very Young.   Here he reads from the chapter In Which Pooh and Piglet Go Hunting and Nearly Catch a Woozle.   One fine winter's day when Piglet was brushing away the snow in front of his house he happened to look up and there was Winnie-the-Pooh. Pooh was walking around and round in a circle thinking of something else. And when Piglet called him he just went on walking. Hello said Piglet. What are you doing? Hunting said Pooh. Hunting what? Tracking something said Pooh. Tracking what? said Piglet coming closer. That is just what I asked myself. I asked myself what?  What do you think you will answer? I shall have to wait until I catch up with it said Pooh. Now look there. He pointed to the ground in front of him. What do you see there? Tracks said Piglet. Paw marks. He gave a little squeak of excitement. Oh Pooh do you think it is a a a woozle? It may be said Pooh. Sometimes it is and sometimes it is not. You never can tell with paw marks.   A.A. Milne in 1929 reading from When We Were Very Young.
