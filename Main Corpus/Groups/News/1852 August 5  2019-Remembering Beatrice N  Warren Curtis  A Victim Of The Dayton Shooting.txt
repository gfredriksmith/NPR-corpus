 Throughout the show we are remembering some of the people who died in this weekend's two mass shootings.  Beatrice Warren Curtis was killed early Sunday morning in Dayton Ohio. Several longtime friends told The Washington Post that she was one of the most generous people they knew.  She was not married and did not have children. Friends say she often helped out families in need by buying school supplies or Christmas gifts for the kids.  Childhood friend Ricky Brown said quote she would do anything for anybody without thought or hesitation.  Warren Curtis was 36 years old. She was one of nine people who died in Dayton Ohio yesterday.
