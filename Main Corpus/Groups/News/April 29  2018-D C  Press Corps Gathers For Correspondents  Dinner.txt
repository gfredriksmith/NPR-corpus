 As you heard in Michigan one of President Trump's targets was the press of course. But here in Washington at the White House Correspondents dinner it was Trump and his lawyer in the crosshairs.   It is 2018. And I am a woman. So you cannot shut me up unless you have Michael Cohen wire me 130000.  Comedian Michelle Wolf hosted the dinner and delivered a profanity-laden 20-minute set. Wolf did not just go after Trump and the Republicans. There was room for jabs at the media Hollywood and Hillary Clinton.   It is kind of crazy that the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia when the Hillary campaign was not even in contact with Michigan.   The reaction? Trump tweeted it was a big boring bust. The New York Times' Peter Baker tweeted unfortunately I do not think we advanced the cause of journalism tonight to which the controversial entertainer Kathy Griffin replied then do not have a comic do a roast.
