 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Democratic Party delegate Donna Burdick says candidate Bernie Sanders is always by her side. At Washington state's Democratic convention this week she proved it.

Although since Burdick crocheted Bernie just from the waist up she really should have crocheted him a podium. It is MORNING EDITION.
