 NPR's Kathy Lohr has been reporting from South Louisiana all week. Today she attended a meeting where she found local residents on edge.  BP and federal officials met with people in Plaquemines Parish today at a Baptist church. Fisherman A.C. Cooper says he heard oil dispersants used in Alaska after the Exxon Valdez spill ruined the fishing in that state. So Cooper wants officials here to stop spraying. Mr. A.C.  We you know are totally against the dispersant. What is going to happen to our fishing in the gulf?  can barely have  again? You know that is a big issue with us right now.  But U.S. Coast Guard Captain Ed Stanton says there is no perfect option. Captain  It is name your poison. Look we are all guilty in this rummage. If you drive a car you own part of this spill. I understand the point view of the fishermen but would you rather have the oil come ashore?  Stanton told the crowd he wants what is best for this area saying he was raised in Louisiana as was BP's community liaison Darryl Willis. Mr.  My role in this response for BP is to make sure we do what we are supposed to do when it comes to the communities that we are hurting because of the fact that this well is still flowing.  That did not calm the fears of many here who depend on fishing for food income and recreation. Kendra Arneson told the group she is worried about the long-term health effects of living with the oil. Ms.  I look at my five- and my eight-year-old and I think in 10 years am I going to have to look at Elena and say to her the reason you are in this hospital bed is because I kept you there. That is what I am here to ask and I really do appreciate that.  An EPA official says they are monitoring air and water quality and have not found anything harmful yet but that provided little comfort here. Kathy Lohr NPR News Plaquemines Parish Louisiana.
