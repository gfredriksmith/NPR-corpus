 Well it being Friday that means it is time for StoryCorps. Today we hear from a U.S. District Court judge who sat on the bench for more than 30 years. Judge John Kane went to StoryCorps in Colorado to talk to his daughter Sally about how his law career began. Mr.  When I was a little kid I went to a Catholic church and the parish pastor was an absolute tyrant. He would name people from the pulpit as to - they would done something he did not like. But there was one guy in that whole church that he would never ever did anything except nod his head in respect. And that guy had a black suit. His name was Walsh. And I asked my mother I said why does everybody treat Mr. Walsh that way? She says it is not mister it is judge.  And you thought... Mr.  I thought that is what I want to be. That is what I want to be. When I was appointed to the bench almost 32 years ago my friends would say well what is the difference? Being a trial lawyer and now you are a judge. And I said well for the first time in my life I am actually listening rather than waiting for somebody to be quiet so I can come back with a quick repartee.  What do you think it does for the person who is being listened to by you? Mr.  Well I think they are appreciative especially in a court where they have waited so long for somebody to listen. One of my pet peeves is when a judge is not paying attention. A court is a sort of secular temple where people come and they expect to be heard. And they should be.
