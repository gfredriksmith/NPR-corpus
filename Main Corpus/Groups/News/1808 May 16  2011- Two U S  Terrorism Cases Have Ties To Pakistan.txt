 NPR's counterterrorism correspondent Dina Temple-Raston is with us to discuss both cases. And Dina let us start with the trial in Chicago. Why is that an important case?  Well so this friend of Rana's was a Pakistani-American named David Coleman Headley. And he is really why this case is getting so much attention because he is going to testify against Rana. And apparently he is going to say that the Pakistani spy agency the ISI played a huge role in these 2008 attacks.  Meaning that Pakistan had a direct connection to a major terrorist plot against India and a real attack.  And when prosecutors were putting together this case over the past year or so you know that was bad enough. But now coming just weeks after Pakistan is having to explain why they did not know Osama bin Laden was hiding out in their country for five years you know the timing cannot be worse.  Yeah this can only make things look worse for Pakistan than they already do.  Exactly. And the fact that people are watching this case now much more than they would have it could have huge implications.  Let us talk about the case in Miami now. This is the two imams who were arrested.  The Khans had to appear in court today to talk about who would be representing them. And they will be back in court on Monday and will likely answer the charges then and plead guilty or not guilty.  And how have those arrests gone over in the Muslim community in South Florida?  So - so far anyway the reaction from the community has been let us let these men have their day in court instead of focusing on perhaps the way they might feel that the FBI was unfairly targeting Muslims. So that is sort of a surprising development.  OK. NPR's Dina Temple-Raston in New York. Thank you Dina.  You are welcome.
