 President Donald Trump has tested positive for coronavirus along with first lady Melania Trump. White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows briefed reporters on the president's condition this morning.   The president does have mild symptoms. He continues to be not only in good spirits but very energetic.  This announcement has upended the presidential race after an already tumultuous week. The Trump campaign announced today that any upcoming events involving the president or the first family will be postponed or made into virtual events.  It is been a busy week for the president - the Supreme Court nomination announcement on Saturday a presidential debate on Tuesday night a rally Wednesday and a fundraiser last night. That means a lot of close contact with aides lawmakers and others.   I fully expect that as this virus continues to go on other people in the White House will certainly have a positive test result.  The positive test results mean the president and first lady join the more than 7 million Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus.
