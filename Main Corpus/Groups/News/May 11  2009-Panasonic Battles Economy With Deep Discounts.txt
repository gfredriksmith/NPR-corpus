 And our last word in business today is Blue Light Special. The global recession is hitting consumer electronics companies so they have been cutting prices to attract more sales. Panasonic's hoping to unload some of its flat-screen TVs with an especially deep discount one third off the price of the biggest plasma screen TV it sells. One hundred and three inches that is more than eight and a half feet wide. The monstrous TV is now priced at 50000 a bargain considering it was priced at 70000. One tech blog suggests the price cut may not just be a result of the bad economy. Perhaps Panasonic is trying to clear out its inventories so it can bring out an even more enormous 150 inch flat-screen TV. That is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
