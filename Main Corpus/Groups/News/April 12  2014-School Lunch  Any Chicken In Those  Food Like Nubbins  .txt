 More food news now this from Monica Eng of member station WBEZ in Chicago who hosts a podcast called Chew the Fat. She is been asking the Chicago public schools for weeks to reveal what goes into their chicken nuggets or as she calls them food-like nubbins. When the school district said that information was not available from their food contractors the station went to the Illinois attorney general's office and filed a Freedom of Information Act request - all to get a chicken nuggets recipe not information on government wiretaps. Yesterday the Chicago public schools finally responded and supplied a recipe that lists at least 28 ingredients even without the breading. Chicago public schools' chicken nuggets turn out to be made from textured soy protein concentrate isolated soy protein - hope I am not going too fast for you to write all this down - brown sugar salt onion powder maltodextrin silicon dioxide citric acid potassium chloride sodium phosphates and oh yes a little chicken.
