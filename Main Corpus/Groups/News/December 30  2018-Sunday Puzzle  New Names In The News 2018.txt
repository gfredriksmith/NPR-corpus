 And it is time to play The Puzzle.   Joining us is Will Shortz. He is puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Hi Will.  Good morning Leila. Welcome to the show.  Thank you so much. So Lulu's told me all about The Puzzle. And I am excited to meet our Puzzle player. But before that please remind us of last week's challenge.  Yes. I said think of a place you can find coins - in two words. Put the second word first. And you will get a compound word describing most holiday cards. What words are these? Well the place with coins is a wishing well. Switch the sides and you get well-wishing.  So we received over a thousand responses. And our winner this week is Lance Wynn from Stansbury Utah. Congratulations and welcome to the program.  Well thank you. It is great to be here.  So Lance how did you figure out this week's challenge?  So funny story - I was dropping some friends off at the airport. And I had - the night before I was binge-watching Futurama. And there was an episode  - I know I am like the smartest NPR listener probably - episode with a Da Vinci Code-style parody. And they had a wishing well type scene.  Wow.  I literally had it on my mind when The Puzzle came up. And yeah the rest is history. Here I am.  So Futurama was the key.  Futurama.  So how long have you been playing The Puzzle?  This is the first time actually.  Wow.  My wife and I listen to it going in to get coffee in the morning. And we never know the answers. So it is crazy...  That is...  ...That I got ...  ...Amazing.  ...It. I know right? I need to go buy a lottery ticket.  Right. So Lance are you ready to play The Puzzle?  As ready as I will ever be.  All right. Take it away Will.  All right Lance and Leila. This is my annual New Names in the News Quiz. And it is something I do every year. I will name some people and things you probably never heard of until 2018 but who sprang to prominence during the past 12 months. You tell me who and what they are.

A female congresswoman in New York.  Right. When she takes office this week she will be the youngest congresswoman in history. Here's your next one - Jair Bolsonaro. First name is J-A-I-R Bolsonaro.
