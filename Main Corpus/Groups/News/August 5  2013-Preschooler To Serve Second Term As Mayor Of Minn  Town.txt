 Good morning. I am Linda Wertheimer. We mentioned the mayor of Dorset Minnesota Bobby Tufts. He is now four years old. His name was pulled out of a hat last year making him mayor of the town of 20 people. Dorset does not have a formal government. Mayor Tufts enjoys shaking hands. He gives fishing advice. Yesterday his name was drawn again for a second term. It will be a second job because now he starts preschool. It is MORNING EDITION.
