 Every year fans of classical music argue over its future and 2010 was no different. Across the country orchestras are struggling financially and audiences are aging. Still NPR's Tom Huizenga reports that 2010 was a good year for what might be called indie-classical.  Is this classical music?   Is this classical music?   Well then how about this?   Labels like classical post-rock chamber music jazz they seem to mean less and less thanks in part to an emerging assortment of young smart musicians who feel equally at home playing in night clubs or concert halls. Like keyboardist and composer Missy Mazzoli leader of the all-female quintet called Victoire.  Ms.  I am coming for my friends. I am .  Mazzoli studied in Amsterdam with composer Louis Andriessen but she also plays in the rock band Mohair Time Warp. As for record labels the Internet has reduced the distance between the big classical companies and the small go-getters. Sarah Kirkland Snider wrote and released this song cycle called Penelope.  Ms.   ...America across the sea.  With two other composers Kirkland Snider runs the small Brooklyn-based New Amsterdam label. This year alone New Amsterdam released 10 albums. And there are many more indie labels like Canteloupe Bedroom Community and Non Classical launched by Gabriel Prokofiev and they are proving to be fertile homes for indie classicalists. Prokofiev by the way is the grandson of Sergei Prokofiev the composer who gave us Peter and the Wolf.  He is also an electronica DJ completely comfortable releasing solo piano music.   Or concertos for turntables.   For Gabriel Prokofiev and dozens of other indie classicalists classical music is not dying - it is doing just fine. Tom Huizenga NPR News.
