 And now some pizza to go with all that craft beer.  We have had pizzas on our roof. We have had pizzas on our driveway pizzas until we are sick of looking at pizzas.  Fran Padilla is someone who does not have to call out for delivery because her New Mexico house is famous for a fictional occupant.   I own the house that was used as Walter White's house.  Walter White the chemistry teacher-turned-meth dealer from the AMC series Breaking Bad.  Even though the show is over fans cannot get enough of it - or of Padilla's house. They drive by they take selfies and...  We have people that want to come by and re-create the pizza scene.    Brought pizza .   Well I am making dinner.  The pizza scene in which antihero Walter White tries to smooth over his rocky marriage with a peace offering.  Or should we say a pizza offering which ends up where else...    .  On the roof.  That scene has so far inspired about a dozen pizza-wielding copycats.  So Fran Padilla turned to the Breaking Bad producers for help.   Hey everybody. We are back for the Better Call Saul Insider podcast.  On a fan podcast this week show creator Vince Gilligan and actor Jonathan Banks dressed down the pizza throwers.   There is nothing original or funny or cool about throwing a pizza on this lady's roof.  And if I catch you doing it I will hunt you down.  And if that does not scare them away well a TV show got Padilla into this mess maybe a TV show can get her out.  I will sit outside with a shotgun in a rocking chair. You know like Granny from Beverly Hillbillies.
