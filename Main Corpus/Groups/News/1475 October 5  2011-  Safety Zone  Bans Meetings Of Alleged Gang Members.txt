 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. A gang injunction safety zone is jargon for a controversial law enforcement technique. It allows police to ban people labeled as gang members from meeting or even speaking to each other within a certain area. And now efforts to create a safety zone in the Long Island town of Wyandanch are being challenged by free-speech advocates. From member station WSHU Charles Lane sent us this story about people in a small town struggling with the gang problem  You know we have a lot of needs. This is the needy needy town.  Heath Broughton grew up here and he says Wyandanch has gotten bad. We are sitting in a park on a warm fall afternoon. Broughton points out a prostitute. People pass by us drinking beer and a group of boys gamble at spades nearby. Broughton a youth counselor says Wyandanch needs a safety zone.  Because it is a violent place. There is gunshots constantly going around here. People getting killed constantly around here.  As much as Broughton wants a safety zone he worries police are targeting a very narrow group of people. In Wyandanch cops ID'd 37 young men as being part of the Bloods. Among them is Anthony Clemons.  I am really not. I am not going to sit here and lie in your face. If I was Blood I would say I was Blood.  Clemons is unemployed and lives with his 1-year-old daughter. He is done county time for a gun a separate assault and drug possession. Cops say they were all gang related. Clemons says politicians are just using him to grandstand.  Possession of marijuana they say oh this is gang. How? Smoking weed is gang? All this is nonsense.  It gives the opportunity for due process.  Suffolk County executive Steve Levy is the politician pushing to bring the safety zone to Wyandanch. He sees it as an experimental tool police can use to prevent gang violence. Levy is sympathetic to critics who say the zones violate people's freedom of speech and right to assemble. But he says police should be able to constrain people with criminal pasts.  Things change when you are convicted and there are conditions placed upon your future. And that is exactly what is happening in this case.  The New York Civil Liberties Union is challenging Levy in court even though these safety zones have largely been ruled legal. Columbia University law professor Jeffrey Fagan specializes in policing strategies. He says there is no definitive evidence that they reduce crime but prosecutors love the injunctions because they make it easier to target gangs.  In a civil injunction the evidence that the prosecutors have to put forward is of a much lower standard.  They are lower because in civil court all it takes to label someone a gang member is a quote preponderance of evidence not like criminal court which requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. But once the injunction is in place violating it is criminal. It is only a misdemeanor but in some states that can be one of three strikes leading to life in prison.  Basically what you have is enforcement at a heightened level at a lower level of suspicion in predominantly minority neighborhoods.   Back at Wyandanch Park watching the boys play spades Jennifer Cooly says that sounds like cover for discrimination.  It is an opportunity to harass black people and tell them no you cannot do this you cannot do that.  Cooly a former teacher says the gang injunction threatens to further erode her community's trust in police.  I feel that my neighborhood is being targeted. I feel safer knowing that the Bloods are around because I know who they are and they know who I am and they are not going to let anybody bother me.  At the opening hearing the judge considering the gang injunction in Wyandanch put the onus on the alleged gang members. To get off the banned list he recommended they get a lawyer.
