 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. Dan Hill did not think to check the operating hours of his gym in Sandy Utah. It is in the name after all - 24 Hour Fitness. When he finished a late-night swim he found himself all alone. He posted online I am literally locked inside 24 Hour Fitness right now. His wife told him to go to sleep. He called the police who eventually freed him. ABC 4 News reports the gym manager pointed out a sign on the door - closed from midnight to 4.
