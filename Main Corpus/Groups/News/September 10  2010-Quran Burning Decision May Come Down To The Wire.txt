 This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Linda Wertheimer.  What complicates that decision is that it involves another controversial item in the news - an Islamic Center planned near Ground Zero in New York. From Gainesville Florida NPR's Greg Allen reports.  Jones says he talked to Musri about plans by New York Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf to build an Islamic Center near the former site of the World Trade Center.  That if they were willing to either cancel the mosque at the Ground Zero location or if they were willing to move that location we would consider that a sign from God.  After two meetings with Florida Muslim leader Mohammad Musri Jones said he was convinced they had a deal.  The Imam has agreed to move the mosque. We have agreed to cancel our event on Saturday. And on Saturday I will be flying up there to meet with him.  The man in the middle Florida Imam Mohammad Musri says he never suggested to Jones there was a deal to move the New York Islamic Center. But Musri said Imam Rauf's office agreed to hear Jones's concerns.  And I had a commitment from them that I and the pastor would be welcome to have a meeting. And that yes that very subject - the moving of the mosque would be discussed and that he would consider it.  Greg Allen NPR news Gainesville Florida.
