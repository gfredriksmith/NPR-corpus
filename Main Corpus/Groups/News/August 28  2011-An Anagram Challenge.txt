 This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I am John Ydstie. And joining us is puzzle master Will Shortz. Hi Will.  Hi John. I understand this is our last week doing the puzzle together.  Yes it is unfortunately. I have really enjoyed it during the last month. So remind us of the challenge you left our listeners with last week.  Yes. It came from listener David Ellis Dickerson of New York City. I said take the name of an aquatic animal in two words - six letters in the first word four letters in the second. Remove the first letter of each word. The remaining eight letters in order will spell a word that might describe an animal that is not aquatic. What is the animal and what is the word?  And the answer is?  Well the animal is a harbor seal. Drop the initials and you get arboreal which means tree dwelling.  We had about 1100 entries this week - not bad going - and out of those entries we have a winner. He is from Houston Texas. Hello Jeff Jacot. Congratulations.  Thank you John. Thank you Will.  And what do you do down in Houston Jeff?  I am an assistant professor of bioengineering at Rice University and Texas Children's Hospital.  And how long did it take you to solve the puzzle?  I solved it almost immediately. I was driving back from breakfast with my five-year-old son and heard it on the radio and went about it kind of backwards. I tried to think of the eight-letter adjective that could not describe an aquatic animal and arboreal came to me. Almost the first thing I thought of.  Very very clever. And are you ready to play today?  I am.  OK. Will meet Jeff. Let us play.  All right Jeff I have a feeling you are going to be good at this because it involves anagrams. Every answer today is the name of a card game. You name the games from their anagrams. For example if I said this T-H-I-S plus W you would say whist.  OK.  All right. Number one is rope R-O-P-E plus K.  Poker.  Poker is it. Number two rebid R-E-B-I-D plus G.  Rebid?  Rebid.  OK. So it cannot be cribbage.  Hold that thought. It is R-E-B-I-D plus G.  Bridge.  Bridge is it. Stare S-T-A-R-E plus H.  Hearts.  Hearts is it. Cheer C-H-E-E-R plus U.  Euchre.  That is it. Passe P-A-S-S-E plus D as in dog.  Spades.  Spades is it. Add oil A-D-D O-I-L plus M as in Mary.  Old Maid.  Old Maid is it. Pinhole P-I-N-H-O-L-E plus C as in Charles.  This one seems tough.  I have got that one actually if you need any help but keep thinking about it. I bet you will get it.  Pinochle.  Pinochle good. In my mug. That is I-N M-Y M-U-G plus R.  Gin rummy.  That is it.  That is excellent.  How about rice bag R-I-C-E B-A-G plus B as in boy.  That is cribbage.  There is your cribbage. Zesty cigar Z-E-S-T-Y C-I-G-A-R plus H. It is a two-word name and a popular card game among kids.  Kids.  It is got a Z in it. That is unusual.  It is. Having trouble with this one.  I am afraid I cannot help you either.  I stumped you both. Okay I will tell you. It is crazy eights.  Oh crazy eights.  Yeah.  OK. Your last one is motel heads M-O-T-E-L H-E-A-D-S plus X.  Is it one word?  It is two words and it is a card game you see on TV.  Texas Hold 'Em.  Texas Hold 'Em is it. Nice job.  All right. Great work everybody.  That was a lot of fun.  Yeah that was. Jeff you did a great job.  Thank you.  I knew you would be good.  Thank you. I really love this chance. I have admired all your puzzles for years Will.  Hey thanks a lot. I appreciate that.  Welcome.  Great work Jeff. And for playing our puzzle today Jeff you will get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin as well as puzzle books and games that you can read about at NPR.orgPuzzle.
