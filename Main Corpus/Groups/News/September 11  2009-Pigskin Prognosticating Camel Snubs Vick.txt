 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Animal lovers are not accepting Michel Vick's return to football. The Eagles picked him up after he went to prison for organizing a dog fighting ring. An animal rights group will now donate dog food every time Vick is tackled. In a New Jersey zoo a camel is protesting. The camel picks pro football games choosing between two crackers representing competing teams. It is usually right. But this year Princess will make no picks involving Vick's team. It is MORNING EDITION.
