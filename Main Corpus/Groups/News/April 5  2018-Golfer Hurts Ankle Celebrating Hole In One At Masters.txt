 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. If you are the 32nd-ranked golfer in the world and you make a hole-in-one at the Masters it is a big deal. That is what happened at the Par 3 Contest the other day. And Tony Finau was psyched. He started jumping up and down to celebrate. Then his ankle buckled and he collapsed on the green. Then Finau put his hands on the protruding ankle and appeared to pop the thing back into place. The golfer says he will be back on the green today maybe opting for a simple fist pump next time he makes a good shot.
