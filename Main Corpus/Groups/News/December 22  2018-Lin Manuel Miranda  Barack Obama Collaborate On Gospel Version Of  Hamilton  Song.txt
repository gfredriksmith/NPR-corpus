  .  Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton helped make a lot of stars including of course Lin-Manuel Miranda.    Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree...  He gives a promising newcomer to musical theater a chance in a new remix of One Last Time a song from Hamilton that he is reworked as a gospel song.    Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am unconscious of intentional error I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors.  The words of the first president George Washington as read by the 44th President Barack Obama. The remix of One Last Time is the final track in a series called Hamildrops which raises money for several nonprofit groups. The recording also features performers who work a little more regularly in song - Christopher Jackson and BeBe Winans. But if President Obama likes musical theater why not play Billy Flynn in Chicago or Tevye in Fiddler?    The ever-favorite object of my heart and the happy reward as I trust of our mutual cares labors and dangers.
