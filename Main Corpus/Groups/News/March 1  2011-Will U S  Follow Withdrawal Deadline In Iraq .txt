 In Iraq the plan is for U.S. troops to leave by the end of this year. And Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said there is no need for a continued U.S. troop presence there. American commanders are not so sure. NPR's Kelly McEvers recently spent a day with General Lloyd Austin who commands all U.S. troops in Iraq. She sent this report.  And learning how to operate and maintain equipment like this American-made M1A1 Abrams tank.   It is a great tank. And I think what is really good is that you can hit targets while you are moving.

If a large contingent of US troops does not remain in Iraq the plan is to shift much responsibility to the state department. But that means funding a private army of contractors to do things that Austin says the real army does best.  If you are talking about combined arms training and joint training then uniformed people probably do better at conducting that type of training.  For U.S. troops to stay and do that training Iraq has to formally ask them. Many analysts believe Iraqi officials will wait until the last minute to do so mainly because no Iraqi politician wants to be seen as pro-American. But Austin says the Iraqis simply cannot wait forever to ask.  The answer is we always need as much time as we can possibly get.  Analysts say it was this kind of relationship buying and selling arms training together conducting joint exercises over the years that allowed the U.S. military to help influence the Egyptian military not to use violence against its people during the recent uprising. Austin says that kind of relationship would be useful in a place like Iraq where you never know what is going to happen.  Kelly McEvers NPR News Baghdad.
