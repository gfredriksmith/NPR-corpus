 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. There is a new face of Chanel No. 5. This perfume has been represented in ads by Catherine Deneuve and Nicole Kidman. And now the face of Chanel is Brad Pitt the first man ever to represent the scent. E Online says it is a seven figure deal for Pitt who played a baseball general manager in Moneyball and a sadistic commando in Inglourious Basterds. No doubt the latter role is what earned Pitt this part since his character was in France. It is MORNING EDITION.
