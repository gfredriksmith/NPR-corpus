 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. It would be easy to laugh at Jordan Toner of Maine. But we would be laughing at ourselves. He is a symbol of our time. Mr. Toner was driving with 7 passengers which was so excellent the driver tried to capture the moment with a selfie. He was leaning over to get everyone in the shot when his car struck a tree. Several people had non-life-threatening injuries and the photo in news stories is not the selfie but an image of the car's crumpled front end. It is MORNING EDITION.
