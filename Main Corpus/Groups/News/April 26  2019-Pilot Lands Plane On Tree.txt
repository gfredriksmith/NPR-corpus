 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. A pilot in Idaho landed where a pilot may never have landed before. John Gregory was flying a small single-engine plane when it lost power. Mr. Gregory saw a field. He braced for a crash landing. But instead of reaching that field he did what seemed like the impossible - landing his plane on the top of a 60-foot fir tree. He was not hurt in the crash but firefighters did have to rescue him from the tree.
