 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. Technology is a fickle thing and a Pakistani politician found out the hard way. Shaukat Yousafzai was trying to be all social media-like - transparent even - by streaming his press conference on Facebook and he gets an A for effort. But on execution he gets a C - C for cat - because Yousafzai accidentally streamed his session with a cat filter on. So there he was answering serious questions with digital pink ears and whiskers. To be sure a catastrophe for our times.
