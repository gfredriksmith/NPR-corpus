 Are the latest revelations from WikiLeaks a welcome window on secrets that powerful public officials are trying to keep secret or a violation of the privacy of regular citizens? Zeynep Tufekci one of this country's ranking experts on information technology and its implications believes that question is called for after WikiLeaks has released 20000 pages hacked from Hillary Clinton's campaign. Professor Tufekci joins us now from the studios of WUNC in Chapel Hill where she is an adjunct professor at the Department of Sociology at the University of North Carolina. Thanks very much for being with us.  Thank you for inviting me.  What is your objection?  I have many objections. I do want to say I think whistleblowing is a very important function in democracy. The problem I am seeing increasingly is that instead of careful curated whistleblowing that takes public interest into account what we are seeing is these mass-hacked emails just being dumped without any consideration for the privacy of the people. And there is a lot of personal information that is being exposed. What this does - and this is what scares me - is that this method is going to be used in the future to any political organization - dissident organizations - that are trying to challenge power. And what they are going to end up seeing is that their personal information is going to be dumped for the world. It looks like the method that started as a way to bring more challenge to secretive elites is actually now evolving into a method that is going to be very destructive to the ecology of dissent.  Professor I am sure write dumb emails every day. But I was told a number of years ago by a lawyer - and I will bet Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin have been told this by high-price lawyers too - you never write an email that you would not be willing to see on the front page of The New York Times.  That as a warning strikes me a little bit like you should not wear miniskirts if you do not want to be sexually assaulted to be honest. It might not be - it might be something you take into account. But it does not mean that if the hacking does occur that it is all fair game.  But to get back to this specific trove of information when it reveals that a candidate for president might have said one thing in front of corporate boards about things like the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal and another thing on the campaign trail do not the American people have a right to know that?  So things like Hillary Clinton's speeches - the Goldman Sachs speeches - I think those do pass the public interest test. Even given the importance of those few newsworthy items if you ask me is the dumping of this much private information and this much internal conversation - the damage this does to our political system - is it worth a few news items if I had a binary choice - all of it or none of it? I would say we have not gained that much. But the ideal would not be that binary choice. The ideal would be that such leaks and hacks would go to responsible journalists who would go through this and would identify what is actually in the public interest.  But these - this day and age - would not people say the news organization is concealing information - that they want the chance to look at the original documents and decide for themselves?  I think in this day and age we really need to figure out when to hold back. In the past news was driven by scarcity. There was not enough news. And you sent around journalists. And you said let us find out what is going on. Right now there is too much information. In the 21st century censorship does not work by withholding information. Censorship now works by flooding with information by causing distraction by causing confusion by creating doubts and just this question mark and shadow so that you really cannot figure out what is going on. And to me this is almost like the opposite of whistleblowing. This is whistle-drowning in confusion and distraction.
