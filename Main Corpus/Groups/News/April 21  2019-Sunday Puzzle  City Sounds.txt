 It is time to play The Puzzle.   Joining us is Will Shortz. He is puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Good morning Will.  Good morning Lulu.  So I hear you are taking a trip to Hawaii.  Yes I am. It is a crazy trip. I am flying on Wednesday speaking on Thursday morning and flying back on Friday.  Wow. What part of Hawaii?  Kauai.  Oh I have never been. I hear it is lovely.  It will be my first time.  Well it does not sound like you are going to have a lot of time to spend there. But enjoy your trip.  Thank you.  And remind us of last week's challenge.  Yes. I said think of a word for a deceitful person. Move the middle letter to the end and you will get another word for a deceitful person. What words are these? And the answer is sneak to snake. And I will tell you it is not as one of our listeners wrote in Santa to Satan. Santa is not deceitful.  We received 835 responses. And our winner this week is Kirstie Newman of Santa Fe N.M. Kirstie congratulations.  Thank you.  So I hear this is the first time you have ever submitted something to The Puzzle.  It actually is. It is the first time I ever solved it and I submitted it.   And you won. And I also hear that you began a new hobby.  Oh yes. I started doing cabaret singing a couple of months ago and I am having a blast .  Oh that is nice. Want to give us a little bit of a preview?  No I do not.   No I do not.  Funny.  It will give you an excuse to come visit Santa Fe which people do not usually need an excuse to come .  All right. Fair enough. Are you ready to play The Puzzle?  Oh I am as ready as I am going to be.  All right Will take it away.  All right Kirstie I am going to read you some sentences. Each one conceals the name of a U.S. city both phonetically and by spelling. Name the cities. For example if I said the musician composed a crackerjack sonata in Mississippi you would say Jackson because that is hidden phonetically and in spelling inside crackerjack sonata.  OK.  And each sentence will include the city's state. Here's number one. The governor did a handspring fielding questions in Illinois.  Someplace Illinois.  Yeah. The governor did a handspring...  Springfield Ill. There we go.  Springfield is it. Good. Number two - my grandmother would belittle rocking chairs from Arkansas.  Little Rock Ark.  That is it. I am looking for a semi-pro vocational training in Utah.  Provo Utah.  Nice. Everyone hated to see Wilbur bankrupted in California.  Wilbur California bankrupt.  Here it is again. Everyone hated to see Wilbur bankrupted in California.  I am going to need a little hint .  OK. Well the most - always look for the most awkward part of the sentence. And here it is definitely Wilbur bankrupted.  This one - cannot think .  All right. I will tell you. It is...  As not coming to me.  ...Burbank Burbank. Wilbur...  Oh Burbank of course.  ...Bankrupted. Yeah yeah.  All right.  All right.  Well - little too twisted .  Here's your next one. Let us plan singalongs all around Michigan.  Oh. Singalong...  What is the capital of Michigan?  Lansing Mich.  There you go - plan singalongs. Good. That is some weirdo vernacular in Delaware.  Doe  vernacular in Delaware.  What is the capital?  I apologize Delaware.  .  I do not know what your capital is. I probably do. I am just not...  It is also an English city where there are cliffs.  That is true.  The White Cliffs of...  Wilshire wilsh  - will .  No. Look inside weirdo vernacular. That is some weirdo vernacular.  Dover Del.  Dover is it. Good.  Dover Del. There it is.  The diners ordered some jumbo calamari in Florida.  Jumbo - jumbo calamari.  Yeah look inside jumbo calamari. Start with the O of jumbo.  Oh.  Yeah just say that.  Ocalla .
