 Good morning. I am Mary Louise Kelly. To be or not to be Shakespeare. That is the question on Zhang Yiyi's mind. Zhang is a best-selling author in China. According to China National Radio he is planning to shell out more than 150000 for plastic surgery to transform himself into Shakespeare's spitting image. The surgeon says it should not be too complicated because Zhang already has a sharp nose and deep eyes kind of like what we think Shakespeare looked like. It is MORNING EDITION.
