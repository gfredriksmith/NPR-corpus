 Here to talk about this new venture NPR's media correspondent David Folkenflik. Hi.  Hey Susan.  I understand there is been an AP video service there for several years now maybe five. But what is different about this new arrangement?  Well you are going to have a reporter and a photographer based there. The video service would capture things like diplomats coming into the country from Western countries perhaps unpublicized in the West. They were able to show evidence of that when whisked there by some of their North Korean minders. But in this case you are going to see a bigger output perhaps a better reflection of what windows they can offer on the hermit kingdom - as it is called.  And why would North Korea why would the government say yes to this right now?  ..  Well as we have said it is a very repressive government. So what for foreign journalists who have been there in the past what kind of stories have they been able to do?  You are also going to be able to capture official North Korean pronouncements every now and then. They denounced the U.S. They will inveigh against the South Koreans for some perceived slight. They will be able to reflect that with the official speaking in their own words.  Although access will remain limited.  The question is what kinds of glimpses that the reporters will be able to elicit somehow to show the deprivation that is occurring to show what is really happening there.  That'ill be the trick will not it?  And the question is you know what happens if things break down? What happens if the South Koreans get certain kind of influence? The AP would want to be on hand for that kind of transition just as Western news organizations sought to be in Havana as they saw Fidel Castro weakening in Cuba.  NPR's David Folkenflik speaking with us from New York. Thank you.  You bet.
