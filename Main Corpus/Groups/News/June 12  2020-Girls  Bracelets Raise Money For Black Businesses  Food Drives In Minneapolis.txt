 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. Kamryn Johnson wanted to support her community in Minneapolis so the 9-year-old and her friends started selling homemade bracelets to donate to black businesses and food drives in the city. Their group Bracelets for Unity and Justice sells each bracelet for 5 or less. But some people are giving 10 20 even 100. In a week the group has raised about 40000 doing good in the world from your own front yard.
