 And it is time to play The Puzzle.   Joining us is Will Shortz. He is puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Hi Will.  Good morning Lulu.  So Will I have something to bring up with you.  Yeah?  You apparently caused quite a debate over Cuban sandwiches this past week.  Right.  And as you know I am from Miami.  Right.  And I took it pretty personally.  Oh interesting.  .  So last Sunday there was the crossword clue city famous for its Cuban sandwiches. The answer was Tampa. And of course Tampa is. But the people from Miami took offense because Miami is also famous for its Cuban sandwiches. I am going to stay...  Indeed one would say more famous...  .  ...If one had a radio show where one could say such things to the public. Anyway...  Speaking hypothetically.  .  I am staying neutral in this debate.  Fair enough. But I did want to bring it up just because I did say that I might have had an in with the puzzle editor of The New York Times .  Maybe sometime I will clue Miami as a city famous for its Cuban sandwiches.  That would be pretty funny. All right. What was last week's challenge?  Yes. It came from listener David Chapus of Rush N.Y. I said think of a six-letter conveyance on wheels. Drop the first letter. Add a new letter at the end. And the result will be another six-letter conveyance on wheels. What conveyances are they? And the first one is boxcar. Do that change and you get ox cart.  We received 817 responses. And our winner this week is Cory Sureck of Austin Texas. Congratulations.  Thank you so much Lulu. Lulu I love your name.  Oh thank you. Thank you. Corey I think your name is great too .  .  How did you figure out this week's challenge?  I was just laying in bed. And it instantaneously - boxcar came to me. And I am like ox car. Oh ox cart. So that was it. It was easy.  Ah. Are you ready to go?  I am ready I think. I am nervous though.  OK. I think you will do great. I can tell. I can tell these things. All right.  OK.  Take it away Will.  All right Cory. Think of a made-up two-word phrase. Each word has two syllables. The first syllable has a long E vowel sound. Change that to a long A sound. And phonetically you will get the second word of the phrase. For example a Jewish roll for a long-eared dog you would say beagle bagel.  Oh my God. OK.  Long E and a long A. No. 1 is a weak story from Aesop.  A feeble fable.  Feeble fable good one. One who despises furnaces.  Hater heater.  Heater hater is right. The E one comes first.  Oh sorry - heater hater.  That is it. What an angel wears in the biggest city on Hawaii's big island.  Hilo halo.  A Hilo halo is right.  I know you were going to be good at this. Did not I say? All right go on.   A more stylish salt or pepper holder.  Oh a chicer shaker.  Chicer shaker is it.  .  Now the rest of the answers work the same except in reverse. The first syllable of the first word has the long A sound and you change that to a long E to phonetically get the second word. And your first one of these is an Oakland football player who enjoys books.  A Raider reader.  Uh-huh. An usher for half man half goat creatures.  Oh what is that guy's name.  I - uh-huh.  Oh a seater satyr - a satyr seater.  That is it. Ones working alongside the pontiff.  The pope - oh wait. .  What is the adjectival form?  Paper peeper. No.  .  Almost almost.  Pape peep.  .  Also close.   The first one - it is papal. It is papal.  Oh a papal people .  Papal people - those are what they are.  That was funny though.  Papal people .  There you go.  I was like pape peep. I am like I do not know that that is at the Vatican.   And your last one - one who is a better welcomer.  A greater greeter.  A greater greeter. Good job.  Yay. See. How do...  Oh my God. That was fun.  ...You did great.   That was so much fun.  Yeah? How do you feel?  I feel good. And I am so excited to talk to both of you.  Aw. Well we are...

Thank you.  All right Will. What is next week's challenge?  Yes. Name a profession in 13 letters that is associated with a particular five-letter country. And the letters of this country appear in left to right order although not consecutively in that profession's name. What is it? And here's a hint the profession is named in a single word.
