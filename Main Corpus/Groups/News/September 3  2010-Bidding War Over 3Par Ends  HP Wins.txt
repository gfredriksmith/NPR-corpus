 Rival computer makers Hewlett-Packard and Dell have waged an eye-popping bidding war over a small California company called 3Par. And that bidding war is now over. Yesterday HP outbid Dell with an offer of more than 2 billion. NPR's Wendy Kaufman explains.  HP and Dell were looking for ways to expand beyond personal computers  with their low profit margins. One promising arena is data storage and so-called cloud computing. Large companies need to store and retrieve enormous amounts of data quickly and efficiently. Forrester Research analyst Andrew Reichman says 3Pars digital storage system does just that. Mr.  Any company that has a data center and operates computer systems needs data storage so any bank manufacturing retail airline - pick any industry - any of the industry leaders would buy systems such as this.  Reichman adds that by acquiring 3Par HP can offer its customers more services and a more one-stop shopping experience. The frenzied bidding for 3Par began two weeks ago when Dell offered 18 a share for a company that was trading at less than 10. Within several days HP offered 24 a share. Dell upped its offer and HP topped that with a winning bid of a 33 a share more than triple what the company was worth on Wall Street before it was put into play. Wendy Kaufman NPR News.
