 Wendy's is reentering the world's second largest fast food market Japan. The burger chain left Japan in 2009 in a dispute with its local business partner. Now it is coming back in style. Our last word in business today is fancy fast food. Instead of a basic burger Wendy's wants to appeal to Japan's more finicky fast food eaters with a new luxurious menu featuring a truffle and forchini-grilled chicken sandwich and a foie gras burger goose liver pate on top of the beef patty. No dollar menu here. The upscale menu comes with upscale prices. The foie gras burger costs about 16. That is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Linda Wertheimer.
