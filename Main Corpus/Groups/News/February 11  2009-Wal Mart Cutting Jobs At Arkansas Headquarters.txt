 NPR's business news starts with layoffs at Wal-Mart. They are not as big as the job cuts announced by retailers like Macy's and Target but Wal-Mart is reducing staff. Up to 800 jobs will be eliminated at the company's headquarters in Bentonville Arkansas. About 14000 people work there. The poor economy is crimping Wal-Mart's sales growth. But the world's largest retailer is still profitable as consumers flock to its stores in search of lower prices. Wal-Mart still plans to open as many as 140 new outlets this year. According to the Wall Street Journal it is also planning a push into Chicago. Wal-Mart has only opened one store there because of community resistance. It hopes the lure of new jobs and sales tax dollars for the city will change that.
