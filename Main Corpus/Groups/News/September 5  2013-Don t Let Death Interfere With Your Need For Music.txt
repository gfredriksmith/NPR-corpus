 In today's Last Word In Business those who live for music can now take it to the grave. A Swedish firm is selling coffins loaded with speakers and a Spotify music account to stream songs 6 feet under.    The Cata coffin employs a pair of two-way speakers tweeters and a divine 8-inch subwoofer fine-tuned to the coffin's unique interior acoustic space.   Steve stop laughing for a minute. The CataCombo...  Subwoofers underground.  ...Sound System includes a headstone with a digital display that shows what song is playing. The package costs 30000.  But users have to rely on the living to keep their playlists fresh. That is the business news on MORNING EDITION. I am Steve Inskeep.  And I am Renee Montagne.
