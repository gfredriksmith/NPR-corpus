 Seoul South Korea's making some changes to its urban landscape. The mayor's office says the women-friendly Seoul campaign will make the city more comfortable for women. They say a lot of urban design focused on men when they were the sole workers in a family and that is changed. So they are installing pink painted parking spots reserved for women that are a bit wider and longer than the average spot and closer to elevators. They also plan to resurface sidewalks in a squishy material to make walking easier for people who wear high heels. A lot of people who wear high heels are women. By the way the President of South Korea Park Geun-hye is a woman and we will bet she can parallel park better than most men and probably anywhere she wants to.
