 This past week the French celebrated Bastille Day which kicked off the French Revolution. Here at NPR though we bring our own fireworks with The Puzzle.   Joining me as always is Will Shortz. He is puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Will good morning.  Good morning Lulu.  So last week you were a program director for the National Puzzlers' League convention. I can imagine that you were mobbed. You were a celebrity. Everyone wanted your autograph. How was it?  Well I do not know about that. But...   Is that what happens there? People do not just like - Will Will - it is not like a Beatles concert?   There are so many brilliant people at the convention it is kind of nice just to be one of the group. I just tell you the National Puzzlers' League is the world's oldest puzzlers organization - goes back to 1883. Our Boston convention was our biggest one ever...  Wow.  ...About 220 people from all over the U.S. and Canada. And if anyone is interested next year's convention will be in Milwaukee.  All right now you know. Will remind us of last week's challenge.  Yeah it came from listener Martin Eiger of Montville N.J. And I said take a certain seven-letter word. Remove the first letter and you get a six-letter synonym of that word. And the letter you removed is an abbreviation for the opposite of both words. What words are these? Well the words are factual and actual. And F is the abbreviation for false which is the opposite of factual and actual.  This week we got more than 200 responses. And our randomly selected winner is Patricia Wheeler of Orlando Fla. Congratulations Patricia.  Thank you very much.  So how did you figure it out?  It was not easy. This one - I worked until Wednesday evening to finally come up with this one. I started with the end the abbreviations and just kept chugging away till I got it.  You are obviously from Florida which is my home state. So I am happy to welcome you to The Puzzle. What do you do?  I am a pediatric geneticist.  Oh what is that?  So I am a physician who diagnosis and manages the care of people with genetic disorders like Down syndrome or a thousand others.  Oh OK. All right. Well Patricia are you ready to play The Puzzle?  I am.  OK great. Take it away Will.  All right. Patricia I am going to give you a four-letter word and a five-letter word. Rearrange the letters in each one to make two opposites. For example if I said post P-O-S-T and tarts T-A-R-T-S you would say stop and start. OK?  OK.  Number one is slot S-L-O-T and fondu F-O-N-D-U.  Lots and...  That is it. Oh not lots no.  Not lots not lots.  Switch those last two letters. Reverse the last two letters.  S-L-T-O?  You have one...  Oh no.  ...Of these in train stations.  Lost...  Yes.  ...And found. That works. OK.  Yes lost and found is it. Number two is ludo L-U-D-O and quite Q-U-I-T-E.  Oh Ludo L - oh - loud and quiet.  There you go.  Good job.  Rove. Rove R-O-V-E and nuder N-U-D-E-R.  What word is that?  Over ...  More nude.   Over and...  I was more nude this morning than I was last night. How is that?   Over and under.  Rove and - over and under good.  Good job .  Dink D-I-N-K and lucre L-U-C-R-E.  Kind and cruel.  There you go. Tale T-A-L-E and relay R-E-L-A-Y.  Tale and relay - teal?  No not teal. It is another anagram of that.  A-T-L-E - oh I am not getting this one. Lulu do you have...  A clue - so I am often the first thing in the morning and never the second thing.   So late and early.  Yes.  There we go.  Late and early is right. Vase V-A-S-E and pends P-E-N-D-S.  Save and...  Uh-huh.  .  Yeah that is right. What is the opposite of save?  Spend.  Yeah.  That was - yeah.  You can save money or spend money.  Good.  Skin S-K-I-N and aloft A-L-O-F-T.  Inks and..  Yeah - no. That is an anagram but it is not inks.  No.  Try another one.  That is an anagram. But that does not go with aloft.  Boats do this.  Float - so float and sink.  Yep.  Yeah there you go. And here's your last one - file F-I-L-E and hated H-A-T-E-D.  Um - no life and...  Yes.  And H-A-T-E-D - death.  Life and death is it. Good job.  That is one way to end The Puzzle. Nicely done.  .
