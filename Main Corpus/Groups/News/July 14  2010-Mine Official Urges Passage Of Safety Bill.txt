 NPR's Frank Langfitt reports on the prospects.  Joe Main the government's head of Mine Safety told a House hearing yesterday that proposed legislation would make it easier for the government to shut down dangerous mines and better protect whistleblowers.  Many miners will not speak up about safety problems for fear of losing their jobs. We are resolved to changing that culture of fear.  George Miller a California Democrat who oversees the House Education and Labor Committee summed up the view of many.  The fact of the matter is the current law is not working.  But Congressman John Kline a Republican from Minnesota cautioned against making new laws before several investigations determine what caused the explosion last April at a Massey Energy mine.
