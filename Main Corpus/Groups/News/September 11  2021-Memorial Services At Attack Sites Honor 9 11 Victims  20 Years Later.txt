 All morning we have been hearing commemoration ceremonies to mark the moment that four flights crashed on September 11 2001. In New York ceremonies were held to mark - oh forgive me - New York ceremonies were held to mark the moment the two flights hit the Twin Towers. 37 of course American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon. And shortly after 10 a.m. United Airlines Flight 93 having been commandeered by passengers fighting with hijackers crashed into a field in Shanksville Pa. A tolling of the bells moments and silence followed by a reading of the names of the 2977 people who perished that day.
