 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. On this Super Tuesday a bit of news involving our founding father. A church in Sioux City Iowa is getting 8000 for its children's summer camp thanks to a Chicken McNugget that resembles George Washington. Rebekah Speight spotted the familiar profile on a McNugget left on her child's plate. After stashing it in her freezer for three years this week she auctioned it off on behalf of her church. It is MORNING EDITION.
