 It is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I am Mary Louise Kelly.  The perjury trial of former pitching star Roger Clemens has blown up. On just the second day of the trial Judge Reggie Walton declared a mistrial. He says prosecutors indelibly tainted Clemens' ability to get a fair trial by exposing the jury to inadmissible evidence. It is not yet clear whether prosecutors will get a second chance. NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg has our story this morning.  Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington.
