 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Imagine if organizers of the original Boston Tea Party applied for a permit to dump British tea in the harbor. Lack of a permit unraveled a tea party yesterday. Anti-tax protesters wanted to dump a million tea bags outside the White House and did not have the right permit to unload them. Then it rained. Finally a protester threw a box of tea bags onto the White House lawn. The protest ended with a Secret Service robot sniffing that package. It is MORNING EDITION.
