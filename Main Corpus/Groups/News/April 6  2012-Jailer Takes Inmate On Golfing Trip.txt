 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. This next story could be material for a movie. A pro golfer is in jail in southern California but Frank Carrillo got out temporarily to play golf.

And he made quite a fashion statement moving from tee to green while wearing his yellow prison jumpsuit. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
