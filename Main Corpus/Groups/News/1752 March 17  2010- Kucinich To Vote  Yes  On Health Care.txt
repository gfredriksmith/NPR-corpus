 Maybe it was the ride on Air Force One.  Maybe it was the help that President Obama got on Monday from this crowd in Ohio.  Unidentified Man Vote yes. President  Did you hear that Dennis? Go on say that again. Unidentified Man Vote yes.  Vote yes they were saying. And today Democratic congressman Dennis Kucinich announced that he will vote yes on the president's health-care bill though it was hardly an enthusiastic endorsement. Representative  I have doubts about the bill. I do not think it is a step toward anything I have supported in the past. This is not the bill I wanted to support.  In a news conference on Capitol Hill Kucinich spoke of the hardships his constituents face of his own struggle with Crohn's disease and of the historic nature of this vote. Rep.  This is a defining moment for whether or not we will have any opportunity to move off square one on the issue of health care.  Asked whether his decision would sway any other liberal Democrats still on the fence the vegan antiwar single-payer-backing congressman had this to say. Rep.  Well if I can vote for this bill there is not many people who shouldnt be able to support it.
