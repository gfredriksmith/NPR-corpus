 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. The Oxford English Dictionary added new words including snowflake.  That is not a new word.  It is right here on the list.  Not a new word - billions fall in snowstorms.  New meaning - snowflake once meant snowflake then a unique person with potential. Now it is commonly an insult meaning someone who is overly sensitive thinks they are special. Kind of an ugly term really but you know it also just means snowflake snowflake. It is MORNING EDITION.
