 For the first time in decades the United States is about to change the way it defines who is poor. The new definition offers an altered picture of American life. It may find that millions more Americans live in poverty than previously reported.  The official formula defines poverty by comparing people's income to the cost of an emergency food diet. That formula remains in place and it will determine the distribution of government aid. But a new calculation is intended to take into account other rising expenses like medical care and child care.  Undersecretary of Commerce Rebecca Blank says the new measure will provide a more subtle understanding of poverty. She spoke yesterday on NPR's Talk of the Nation.
