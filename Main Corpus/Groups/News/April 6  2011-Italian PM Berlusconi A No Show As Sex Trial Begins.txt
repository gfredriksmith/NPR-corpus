 NPR's Sylvia Poggioli reports on the trial known as Rubygate.  But Berlusconi insists all his dinner parties are elegant and sober affairs and denounces the charges as part of a communist conspiracy.   I am the man most persecuted by magistrates in the history of mankind throughout the world. I have been subjected to more than 2500 hearings.  Berlusconi has undergone a dozen-odd trials and was mostly acquitted either thanks to the statute of limitations or changes in the law. In fact prosecutor Ilda Boccassini - the highly respected Iron Lady of the Italian judiciary - failed to win a conviction against him after false accounting was decriminalized. This is how she described Berlusconi in her closing arguments.   He is a person who lies to the Italian people. We have been able to prove that all the statements given by Silvio Berlusconi were not true.  At 17 she ended up in Milan after catching the eye of a talent scout at a beauty contest and she started working as a belly dancer at nightclubs. Shortly later el Marough attended her first party at Berlusconi's villa. According to prosecutors she has given conflicting versions of events. In a tearful interview on a Berlusconi-owned TV network she denied having sex with the premier.    He did not put a finger on me. Why do people have to see bad things when there is nothing bad? After all my bosses put their hands all over me I finally meet a man who gives me 7000 euros and does not touch me.  Sylvia Poggioli NPR News Milan.   This is NPR News.
