 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Morgan Sims walked out of the Craighead County Spelling Bee in Arkansas with a first place trophy and a savings bond. But she will not be going to the state spelling bee. That is because her school did not pay a 100 entry fee. That fee's optional for the county contest but required for a student to go onto the state level in the Scripps National Spelling Bee. And the word Morgan Sims got right to win the county spelling bee debacle. It is MORNING EDITION.
