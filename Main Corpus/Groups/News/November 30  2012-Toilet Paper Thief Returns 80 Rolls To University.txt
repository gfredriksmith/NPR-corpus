 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. The holidays bring out the spirit of giving and giving back what you have pilfered. Recently we told you about a 1930s teapot returned to the Waldorf Astoria. This morning a tale of toilet paper. Eastern New Mexico University received a gift box filled with 80 rolls of toilet paper and a Christmas card apologizing for stealing rolls from a dorm years ago. Another inspiring holiday moment or another TP prank? It is MORNING EDITION.
