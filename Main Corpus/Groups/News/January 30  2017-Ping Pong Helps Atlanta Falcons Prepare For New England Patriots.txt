 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. The Atlanta Falcons are ready for the Super Bowl - of Ping-Pong. Coach Dan Quinn says the team put three Ping-Pong tables in the locker room which helped players to bond. Since they are heading for the championship it apparently worked. One player says it improves hand-eye coordination.  Oh man - but I hope he does not miss the game with a Ping-Pong injury. Oh come on Rachel. They are going to be ready to play the New England Patriots. Yeah as long as the Ping-Pong balls are not mysteriously deflated.  It is MORNING EDITION.
