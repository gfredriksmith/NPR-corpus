 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. We have been hearing a lot of stories of the new pope's modesty and now this. The pope called a Buenos Aires newspaper kiosk to cancel his own subscription.

The then-cardinal always collected and once a month returned the rubber bands from his newspapers. It is MORNING EDITION.
