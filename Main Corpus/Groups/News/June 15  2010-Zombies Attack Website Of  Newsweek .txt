 Good morning. I am Deb Amos. This news just in Zombies attack - but only on Newsweek's website. The site posted a hidden page that appears by typing in key words revealing these articles Fleeing the Zombie Horde What Are Our Options? and Zombies and You. A spokeswoman confirmed that Newsweek's programmers created the joke for a few hours. There is no guarantee it will not rise from the dead from a late-night staff with too much coffee and time on their hands. It is MORNING EDITION.
