 I thought in my lifetime we would be establishing a base on the moon maybe by now. And certainly even though I might not be alive when we landed on Mars I would be watching crews train and the rockets being built. And of course you can see none of that is happening.  No. We are not living in the future envisioned by astronaut Alan Bean back in 1969. In November of that year he became the fourth human being to walk on the moon. Today to mark the 45th anniversary of the first moon landing Alan Bean recalled how his mission Apollo 12 almost ended in disaster moments after launch. Captain Alan Bean is our Sunday conversation.  Well we had a storm rolling in. We were sitting in a - you know inside our spacecraft - Pete Conrad Dick Gordon and I. We were thinking let us launch. We knew that if we did not launch within just about three or four hours you had to wait a whole month. So we wanted to go. And we did not think much about launching during a storm  'ecause we had not ever trained for that and thought about that much. People just assumed we would not. And so we counted down. We launched. Everything was going great for almost the first minute. And then we were struck by lightning two times. We did not know we were struck by lightning in the cockpit. We got all sorts of warning lights lost the electrical power from our fuel cells. We were trying to solve the problem. Mission control - they got a report from the launch site that they saw a big lightning bolt come out of a cloud and hit the launch pad. And they said those guys got struck by lightning.   .  Roger. We copy. Pete you are looking good.  Good . Good thrust on the second .  We have got a problem here. I do not know what happened. I am not sure we can get hit by lightning.  You know we were trying to figure out what to do. They were trying to figure out what to do. And working together we solved the problem.  OK I have . And Alan's got the fuel cells back on. And we will be working on the .  Can you describe what you felt heard and saw when you left Earth's orbit?  Well once again we are wanting to go to the moon. We have done one revolution around the earth where we got our computer ready to guide the rocket towards the moon. And we were ready to go. And we were just thinking OK we know that we have been hit by lightning. Mission control is going to have to make a decision on whether to launch us to the moon or not. They apparently talked it over at the highest levels and decided well if it did do something wrong to the spacecraft like the parachute system or something like that - if we had them enter now they would get killed earlier than if we sent them to the moon and let them do whatever else they are doing there and then come back 10 days later. If their parachutes do not work then well I guess they do not. At least they have had 10 days and a great adventure.  What did that mean - just skipping ahead for a moment - when you were going through reentry were you scared about those parachutes opening?  We thought about it. I would have to say I did not think about it one time between headed to the moon and about an hour prior to entry. And we are going through all the checklists getting in position to make the entry and all of that other - and I think either Pete Dick or I said well I wonder how those parachutes are doing. And then someone else said - maybe me or Peter or Dick said well we will find out in about 55 minutes. And that was it. Nobody was afraid. Nobody was anything. It was just part of the way of life of being an astronaut. If you could not have that attitude you could not do the job. So it was - it was OK. Whatever it was it was OK.  Now can you recapture that moment for us Captain Bean when you climbed through the door down the ladder onto the moon?  I would say I had zero philosophical thoughts at that time. I was operating on a time checklist as we would been trained to do to try to maximize every really minute on the moon. You know no telling what that cost per minute to be on the moon. Millions and millions of dollars. So you wanted to make every one of them productive. The only time I thought wow this is the moon up there way above us there - 240000 miles away is the Earth - was when I was running from exploration site to the next one 'ecause there you are just running along going to the next place you want to investigate. And you can have a time to think. And I can remember I - it was hard for me to believe. I would look down and say this is the moon. This is the moon. Then I would look up and say that is the earth that is the earth in my head. So it was science fiction to us even as we were doing it.  You have had a post-astronaut career as an artist. Could you talk about how you use moon dust in your paintings?  I had the good fortune and the gift to be one of the 12 men to walk on the moon. And my hobby has been since I was a test pilot painting. Maybe if I learn to paint well enough - I do not know if I could but maybe if I did - then I could leave behind when I am gone stories that would be lost to history forever - images of things that we did that were - at least I thought were interesting. Stories that not only I knew but other astronauts knew. So that was my decision to you know say I love being an astronaut. I have been training to do this my whole life. But I really have a responsibility to go to do this other job which I then had been doing for the last 33 years or so. But each painting does have moon dust in it.  Astronaut artist and moonwalker Captain Alan Bean. It is been an honor to speak with you. Thank you so much.  It is been a pleasure.
