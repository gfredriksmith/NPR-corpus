 The credit card company Visa may be adding some more fine print to its user agreement soon. The company said this week it is rolling out a new person-to-person payment service later this year. Say you need to pay the babysitter but you do not have the cash. Visa says you could digitally transfer the funds from your account to your babysitter's account if you know her cell phone number email address or account number. But it is not an entirely new idea. Ebay's PayPal service has been doing something similar for years.
