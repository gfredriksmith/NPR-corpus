 Good morning. I am Linda Wertheimer. Police in Germany report a man shot in the back of the head five years ago. He lived but not to tell the tale. He did not know he would been shot. He went to the hospital recently complaining of a bump on the head. X-rays showed something. Doctors removed a .22-caliber bullet. The man remembers a blow to the head back then but did not seek medical attention at the time. It was New Year's Eve. It is MORNING EDITION.
