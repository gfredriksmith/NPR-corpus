 And our last word in business is an FBI warning. Federal authorities have issued an advisory about Video Girl Barbie. The doll has a camera lens in her necklace and a video screen in her back. She can capture 30 minutes of footage which is downloadable to a computer. Mattel is marketing Video Girl Barbie to quote budding filmmakers. Now the FBI has issued a memo to other law enforcement officials to be mindful of this device. They are worried that child pornographers could use it. Not to dismiss the seriousness of that concern but bureau clarifies this is just advice for law enforcement not the consumer safety alert. Many parents may be mindful of another possible threat posed by Video Girl Barbie instead of being captured in embarrassing moments that later turn up on reality TV shows those cute kids might soon be capturing embarrassing videos of their parents. And that is the business news on PR News. I am Steve Inskeep.  And I am Renee Montagne.
