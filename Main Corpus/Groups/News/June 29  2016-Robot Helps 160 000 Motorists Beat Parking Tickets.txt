 Good morning. I am David Greene with bad news for some lawyers. The robots are here and they are coming for your jobs. Joshua Browder was fed up with parking tickets. So the teenager made Do Not Pay a bot to help people challenge their fines. The robot chats with people in London and New York asks them what happened and then writes an appeal. So far Browder says it is helped 160000 people beat their tickets. The whole thing takes less than a minute and it is absolutely free - another blow to the lawyers out there. It is MORNING EDITION.
