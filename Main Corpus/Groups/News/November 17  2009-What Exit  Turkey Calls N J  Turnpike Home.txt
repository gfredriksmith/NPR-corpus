 Good morning. Im Steve Inskeep. A wild turkey is attacking the New Jersey Turnpike. The turkey made its home amid the industrial splendor at Interchange 14B. It wanders around the toll booths. It dodges cars and disrupts traffic. It sits on the toll collectors' parked cars and it defies every effort to catch it. We do have a warning for this turkey Thanksgiving is near and if revenge is a dish thats best served cold turkey is a dish that is best served hot. Its MORNING EDITION.
