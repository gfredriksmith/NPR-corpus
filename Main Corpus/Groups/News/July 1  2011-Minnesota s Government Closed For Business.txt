 Minnesota is not open for business. That is the top of our business news today.   Thousands of state workers in Minnesota are being told to stay home today after lawmakers failed last night to reach an agreement on a new state budget. That also means tax refund checks will not be going out and zoos and parks will likely be closed over holiday weekend. This is - by the way - the second shutdown in Minnesota in six years.
