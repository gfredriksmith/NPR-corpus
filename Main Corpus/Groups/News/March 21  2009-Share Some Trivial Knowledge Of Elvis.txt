 Mr.   I am all shook up.  There is a new encyclopedia in town and it is not the latest version of the Britannica. It is an A to Z of Elvis Presley's life.  Mr.   We are caught in a trap I cannot walk out because I love you too much baby.  WEEKEND EDITION is searching for the most knowledgeable Elvis fan on the planet. The person we pick will be quizzed by a panel of Elvis experts. So if you know what Elvis's height was on his driver's license the color of his first car or his parents' names then put on your blue suede shoes and shake rattle and roll over to your computer and go to NPR.orgSoapbox. You could be doing the jailhouse rock on WEEKEND EDITION with Scott Simon.  Mr.   Everybody in the whole cellblock was dancing to the jailhouse rock.  This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I am Liane Hansen. Scott Simon will be back next weekend. This fool will be rushing back in tomorrow.
