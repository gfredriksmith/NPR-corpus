 The table was set last week for Kris Hart to declare his candidacy for the Republican nomination for governor of Pennsylvania. The 34-year-old entrepreneur had recently returned to his home state from Washington D.C. where he had owned a neighborhood grocery store worked on a Senate staff and started a program to help the homeless. What better time to run for office? Hart planned his announcement for last Thursday but then he got a call from a reporter - a public radio reporter in fact. Dave Davies of our member station WHYY in Philadelphia had a question for the prospective candidate. What about the residency requirement? Oh that. Turns out the Pennsylvania Constitution requires candidates running for governor to have lived in the Keystone state for a minimum of seven years before the election. Having moved back home just last month Hart was way way short. But you cannot keep a would-be-Paul  down. Kris Hart now says he is considering a run for the U.S. Senate from Pennsylvania an office that does not have a prior residency requirement.
