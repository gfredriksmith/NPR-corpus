 Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are about to receive an Indian-style welcome to their new jobs. A group of volunteers put together a kolam in Washington D.C. That is a traditional South Indian art form that is used as a sign of welcome. Shanthi Chandrasekar is the artist behind this project.  So there is a grid of dots that is drawn using powdered rice or rock powder in front of houses on the floor and a line that goes around these dots all done freehand.  The kolam team asked people to submit a single dot design on a 12-by-12-inch paper tile. They got over 1800 submissions.  From stickers to favorite cartoon characters to...  Traditional Indian Madhubani painting and peacock designs.  Sowmya Somnath and Roopal Shah are volunteer organizers and they say the variety of images show how diverse the participants are.  So there is this really beautiful kind of combination of tiles with peoples' spirit connecting in a way that creates this mosaic ground cover.  It is not just a welcoming of a new administration it is this idea that so many people came together with all of their stories and it is those stories now that are more and more a part of the American fabric and more and more welcome.  And while the kolam does connect with Harris' Tamil heritage it also symbolizes a way forward out of a tough moment for the country.  The dots represent problems in life and if one can weave around these dots and also maintain a symmetry while going around it sort of brings out solutions as you work on them because it is very meditative.  The 2021 inauguration kolam is set to reveal its positive energy digitally over Zoom today.  And eventually the tiles will be assembled into a kolam of more than 2500 square feet once security around the capital eases up.
