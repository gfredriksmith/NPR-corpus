 Homeland and Modern Family were big winners last night at the Emmy Awards. For Showtime the Homeland win was a first-ever Emmy for a drama series.  It is a thriller about the CIA fighting terrorism in the U.S. It also won acting awards for Claire Danes and Damian Lewis.   Hello everybody. I am Damian Lewis. I am one of those pesky Brits. Apologies. I do not really believe in judging art but I thought I would show up just in case. It turned out all right.  A writing award for Homeland brought its total take up to four last night and four awards went to the big comedy winner Modern Family.  Which is considered an old hand at the Emmy comedy thing. Last night was its third win in a row as Best Comedy Series. But they have nothing on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  Stewart's program had its 10th consecutive Emmy win for Best Variety Show Last night.   We make topical comedy which has the shelf life of egg salad like nobody cares after five days. So to do this for 15 years and to have tangible proof that what we made was not just ephemeral is wonderful.  And as Stewart waxed eloquent about this honor he dropped a few words that prompted producers to cut off his microphone.   Years from now when the Earth is just a burning husk and aliens visit they will find a box of these and they will know just how predictable these .  That is Jon Stewart of The Daily Show.
