 This is WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. I am Rachel Martin. The tradition of filmmaking in Poland is as long as the history of filmmaking itself. A Polish inventor patented a camera even before the pioneering Lumiere Brothers in France. Unless you spent a lot of time in art house theaters in the 1960s '70s and '80s the only Polish filmmaker you may know is Roman Polanski. Now a new series of 21 films chosen by Martin Scorsese is beginning an American tour to try to change that. Here's Howie Movshovitz.  Martin Scorsese fell in love with Polish movies when he was in college.  The images have stayed in my head for so many years. Since the late '50s I close my eyes I see the - especially from Ashes and Diamonds from Saragossa Manuscript. They are very vivid expressive immediate.  Scorsese vividly recalls director Andrzej Waida's 1957 Ashes and Diamonds. Considered one of the masterpieces of Polish cinema it takes place on the last day of World War II. The Nazis are gone and the Soviets are moving in. A young man talks to a young woman in a ruined church.         Their beautiful dialogue is played out over an image of an upside down crucifix which is in the foreground. But that is introduced through a sound on the soundtrack a squeaking sound...        ...as the crucifix swings slowly. And as they speak an emaciated white horse which they tell me represented Poland in a way just walks calmly right through the scene.   Scorsese saw a restored print of Ashes and Diamonds along with a number of other classic Polish films when he received an honorary degree from the film school in Lodz two years ago. He saw in the films a powerful sense of contradiction.  Polish cinema flourished amazingly artistically under the toughest constraints. So there is a strong tragic sense in Polish cinema but it seems to be in balance with very very strong strains of a spiritual resilience and also a dark comedy. So it is a very special cinematic experience.  Scorsese decided to organize a traveling series for the United States through his non-profit foundation and the independent distributor Milestone Films. It includes two films by Krzysztof Kieslowski four by Andrzej Waida and three by Krzysztof Zanussi who made his first short films in the late 1950s. Zanussi says the series spans a crucial period in Polish history.  We are a nation and we are a country that was challenged and was menaced and we lost our statehood for over one century. So the position of an artist is very different in Poland than in many normal countries. It is not just my private business what I am telling to the public. I have to assume some responsibility for the future of the country for the actual state of the country. All the expression we bring to the public is part of our defense. So our concern about the survival of our identity of our culture of our statehood is something very particular. And I think most of the films selected for this festival they try to deliver something to our viewers that will make them stronger and make them understand better who they are and what their aspirations could be.  All of the films in the series were made during the Communist period in Poland. But Zanussi says that by the time he was making feature-length movies in the 1970s restrictions on artists had eased somewhat. In his 1980 film The Constant Factor a young man pays a heavy price for resisting the standard corruptions of daily life. Zanussi says he avoided the censor's ax by questioning his countrymen's ethics rather than their politics.  I was worried that life in my country becomes really unbearable because corruption is everywhere. And wherever I look all the institutions act in a dishonest way. You know I think the ethical issues are prior to any political issues because politics is something more day-to-day level and ethics is something general. But this is a permanent problem that making a film about corruption I am also involved in some sort of corruption because some concessions are inevitable in filmmaking if you want to see your film done.  Filmmaker Krzysztof Zanussi says that Polish films are very much about Poland. And the man who chose the films for the U.S. tour Martin Scorsese emphasizes that they are important to the world because they are unique to Poland.  It is important that we look at all national cinemas outside our own. Because to look at a national cinema it gives you a sense of visions of life come from no one person but they are shared. And Polish cinema taken together tells a story that is different from the one told by Chinese cinema or Japanese cinema. And both in turn tell the stories that are different than the ones told by Italian and French and German cinemas. And you know I just think knowing other cinematic cultures gives you a new sense a renewed sense of the cinematic culture in your own country. And you can see it in a new light. It enriches it.  And as Scorsese points out the restored prints of these films are once again ready to be seen on a big movie screen as their makers intended. For NPR News I am Howie Movshovitz.
