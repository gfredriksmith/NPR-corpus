 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. A hunter in Norton Massachusetts may try harder next time to identify his target. The hunter thought he saw a saw white-tailed deer in the woods. In reality he was looking at two dogs being taken for a walk. The good news is that the hunter was not a good shot. When he fired he missed both dogs. The bad news is he wounded the woman walking them. At least the hunter did not have to go far to get police. He was an off-duty state trooper. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
