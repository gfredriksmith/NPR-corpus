 Now a brief remembrance of a man who changed casino gambling. Robert Manz died last weekend at age 65. He was the creator of popular slot machine games such as Blazing Sevens.   In the game the machine teases players with near-wins. You would get a seven another seven then a blank. And Manz designed his games to do something you might not expect at your average casino.  In his games that he would design he would design it so players could win.  That is Charlie Lombardo an old friend and former colleague.  He felt that there is times it was good for a player to go home with money in his pocket that the casino should not always take it all and send them home broke.  And casinos that used Manz's creations did not go broke either. Lombardo says the games were a mainstay of Bally Technologies the company where Manz worked for more than two decades. He was once a military air traffic controller. He then worked his way up the ladder at Bally learning on the job. The key says Lombardo is that Manz knew winning alone was not enough. To be successful a game had to be entertaining. But of course it never hurts to win.   Robert Manz one of the top designers of casino games died last weekend in a car accident in Las Vegas.
