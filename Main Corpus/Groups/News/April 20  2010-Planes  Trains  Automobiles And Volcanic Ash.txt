 Last Friday NPR's Sylvia Poggioli was supposed to hop a plane for the two-and- a-half hour flight from Amsterdam to her home in Rome. The volcano in Iceland changed that. Four days later she is still far from home.  By Saturday the only option was the train. A three-hour wait at the ticket counter in The Hague and the news was bleak. The only way to Rome was to travel first eastward then down through Germany and Switzerland changing trains six times. Estimated time of arrival three days later. I took my chances grabbed the last available ticket to Paris - convinced once there I could hop a train to Rome. Fat chance.  Sylvia Poggioli NPR News Nice.
