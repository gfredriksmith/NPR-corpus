 And todays last word in business is cosmic humor. A California company called Space Exploration Technologies this week became the first private business to launch a spacecraft into orbit and safely guide it back to earth. There were no humans onboard but there was a secret payload. Now we know what it was. Yesterday Space Exploration Technologies revealed that it was a wheel of cheese. This was a tribute to a sketch by the British comedy group Monty Python.  Mr.    Parmesan. Mr.   No. Mr.   Mozzarella. Mr.   No. Mr.   Paper Cramer. Mr.   No. Mr.   Any Danish Bimbo. Mr.   No. Mr.   Czechoslovakian sheeps milk cheese sir. Mr.   No. Mr.   Venezuelan beaver cheese? Mr.   Not today sir no.   The cheese on board the spacecraft was a wheel of French Le Brouere. Now that the spacecraft has returned to earth the cheese is on a barge being towed back to California. And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Steve Inskeep.
