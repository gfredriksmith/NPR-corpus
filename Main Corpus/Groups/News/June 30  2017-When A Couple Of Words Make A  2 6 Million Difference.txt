 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. A Michigan man was laid off from his job and then thought he got a windfall. The company told him his severance pay would be 81000 per week for 34 weeks. That is 2.7 million. Francois El-Hayek said it seemed fair since he worked there for decades. Later the company said it was a mistake. It is just 81000 over 34 weeks. He sued to make Trico Products keep the original promise. He lost but almost had revenge.
