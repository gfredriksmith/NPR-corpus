 Good morning. I am Mary Louise Kelly. Rosa Dominguez stopped for gas and drove home more than half a million bucks richer. She bought a winning scratchcard in Paso Robles which is great. But a few days later she needed gas again. So she stopped - different station - and bought a 5 Lucky Fortune ticket which turned out to be the 100000 jackpot. She is using her winnings to buy a new car. No word yet if this one might get better mileage. It is MORNING EDITION.
