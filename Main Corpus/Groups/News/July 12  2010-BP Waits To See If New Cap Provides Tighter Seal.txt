 This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Renee Montagne.  Good morning.  Good morning.  So BP's been working on this all weekend I gather. What have they accomplished so far?  And this is - think of it as sort of an adapter ring. Once you have that bolted down then you can clip on top of that the next piece which is the key piece this valve device. Weighs 150000 pounds and it is called a Three Ram stack. And that is going to go on the top of this. That'ill be the next step to do that.  And that is like a new cap replacing the older leakier one?  That is exactly right.  OK. I mean it sounds very complicated. They are trying to get a lot done tackle this from a lot of directions. And of course nobody's ever done anything like this before. I mean how are you rating the chances that this operation will work?  They built a lot of backup tools too. In case what they had did not work the first time they already had their backup ideas in place. So a lot a lot of planning went into it and I think we are seeing that as we watch these events unfold in essentially in slow motion on the seafloor.  But I mean in the meantime Richard oil still gushing into the Gulf. When do we expect to see that slow down?  And then the question is getting the rest of this once this valve assembly is on top then they will also have maybe a couple of weeks actually to get all of that working. But we will see. It could - we could actually have some good news really by the end of this week.  End of this week? OK. Thanks Richard.  My pleasure.  That is NPR's Richard Harris.
