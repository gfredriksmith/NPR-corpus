 NPR's business news starts with Japan and a bit of good news.   Nissan said today it will resume operations at a plant in southern Japan. It will operate tomorrow and Friday while inventory supplies last but it is unclear if production will continue past Friday. Japanese automakers are struggling to repair damage and deliver supplies after last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami. Toyota says all of its 12 assembly plants in Japan will remain shut for at least another week and Honda said its domestic production will remain suspended until Sunday
