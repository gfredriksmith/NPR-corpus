 Good morning. I am David Greene. When it comes to music playlists there is a lot of sharing these days. Well Jay Martin of Aspen Colorado did not have sharing on his mind when he left his bike outside his wife's office. Someone took it and then returned it to the county courthouse with a note. Sorry I stole this bike. I rode it home. Please give it back. The note was signed off Drunk. News of the returned bike made the Aspen Times which is how Martin got his bike back. He has decided not to press any charges. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
