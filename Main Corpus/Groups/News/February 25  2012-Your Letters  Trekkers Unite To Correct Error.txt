 Time now for your letters.   Today a correction so maybe some music that is a little more suitable.   Of course that is the Klingon Battle Theme from Star Trek The Motion Picture. But I am guessing Cynthia Robinson from Monroe Connecticut already knows that. She was just one of the Trek-kers who wrote in about a serious error we made in last week's interview with William Shatner. We were talking about Christopher Plummer and played this clip from Star Trek VI.   And he gets one of the great as far as I am concerned movie lines of all time.    That actually is a great line. And I worship great lines.  Great line but wrong actor. Cynthia Robinson set her email on stun. When interviewing anyone from the original cast of Star Trek you must do your homework or you will get e-mails like this one she wrote. The audio clips that you played from Star Trek VI were not the voice of Christopher Plummer in his stellar role of Chang but that of David Warner in his all-too-brief but well-acted role of Chancellor Gorkon. She added Live long and prosper and buy yourself a compendium. Well here's to you Ms. Robinson. Of course you are correct. And we have not picked up a compendium but we offer you Christopher Plummer the Klingon Shakespearian.   Whatever language you speak - Klingon Ferengi Borg or Esperanto - we would like to hear from you. We are on Facebook and Twitter at NPRWeekend. I am at NPRScottSimon.
