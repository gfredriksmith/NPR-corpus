 Good morning. I am David Greene. For all the talk of an ideological divide on the Supreme Court the justices yesterday were unanimous in ruling that John Sturgeon can take his hovercraft back out and do some moose hunting. Park rangers told him his hovercraft was not allowed on a river that ran through national conservation areas in Alaska. The highest court in the land disagreed. In a majority opinion Justice Elena Kagan wrote that Mr. Sturgeon is now free to quote rev up his hovercraft in search of moose.
