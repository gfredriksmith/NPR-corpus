 NPR's business news starts with earnings at Facebook.   For the first time as a public company Facebook has reported it is earnings. After its botched IPO investors were hoping for a big positive surprise to put the shine back on the social network. That did not happen. As NPR's Steve Henn reports Facebook recorded a loss.  Despite narrowly beating many analysts expectations in terms of revenue Facebook's earnings disappointed investors. In after hours trading last night the stock fell more than 10 percent - and hit record lows. Debra Aho Williamson follows Facebook for eMarketer.  Before they went public we had forecasted that Facebook would have 6 billion in total revenue this year. Obviously things have changed.  Now Wall Street's investment banks believe Facebook's on track to earn a billion dollars less than Williamson and other expected just a few months ago.  So what happened?  What we saw last year was a lot of hyper growth.  And then it stopped. Last year the amount of ad revenue Facebook was bringing in the door was almost doubling every 12 months. Today ad revenue is still growing at the company - but the rate of growth is much slower and it is decelerating. When Facebook went public it was valued at more than 100 billion. But that sky-high stock price was built almost entirely on expectations of what the company would do in the future. And today expectations have changed. Steve Henn NPR News.
