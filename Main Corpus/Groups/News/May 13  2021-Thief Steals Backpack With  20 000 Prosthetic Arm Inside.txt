 Parker Hanson was born without a left hand. But that has not kept him from his favorite game. He plays college baseball in South Dakota as a pitcher. Earlier this month Hanson's truck was broken into. And the thief took a backpack. Problem though - Hanson's 20000 prosthetic arm was in the backpack. Friends launched fundraisers to replace the prosthetic. A hospital in neighboring Minnesota is donating a new arm to the player. So all that money now goes to charity.
