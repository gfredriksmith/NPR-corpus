 Puerto Rico is gearing up for the Atlantic hurricane season which officially begins in two weeks. Officials say they are well-prepared this time should the island get hit. But across Puerto Rico residents still recovering from Hurricane Maria have their doubts. NPR's Adrian Florido reports.  Carlos Acevedo heads Puerto Rico's emergency management agency. He knows a lot of people have their doubts. And he acknowledges that before Maria his agency really did not take updates to its hurricane plan seriously.  .  Every year he says we would rip out the first and last pages of our plan replace them with two new pages sign them and call it a new plan. This year he says the plan has been completely rewritten.  .  Our response is guaranteed to be different next time he says. We are basing it on the best possible lesson we could have had. That was Maria. Officials here say they are making big changes. They are dramatically increasing warehouse space to store emergency supplies. The supplies are being spread across the island. Generators have been prepositioned satellite communication systems have been installed at police and fire stations and hospitals across the island and large-scale drills will start soon. Rafaela Serrano she heard all about those plans on TV. She is not convinced.  .  Just look at what my house looks like she says. Her roof is gone. The gaping hole is covered by a blue tarp installed by FEMA.  .  A lot of people have not fixed their houses yet she says. No we are not prepared. Serrano says it is taken her eight months to save enough to rebuild her house. She has the money in hand but she is decided to hold off on repairs until this next hurricane season ends - just in case she says. Adrian Florido NPR News Caguas Puerto Rico.
