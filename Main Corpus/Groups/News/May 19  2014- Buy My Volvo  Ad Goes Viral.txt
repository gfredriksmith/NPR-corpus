 And our Last Word In Business today is buy my Volvo. When Christopher Castor wanted to sell his 1993 Volvo 245 GL he did not just put up any old ad. The Swedish graphics artist made a video with his friends and posted it on YouTube. And we are talking about it because it went viral.    Yeah this video seems like the trailer for a slick summer blockbuster. I mean there are sweeping shots of the car there is this dramatic score.
