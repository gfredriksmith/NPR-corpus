 Good morning I am Renee Montagne. A man was trying to evade police after hijacking a new SUV at gunpoint when to his surprise the vehicle ground to a halt. Turns out police called operators at OnStar who sent a command that electronically disabled the gas pedal. It was the first time GM's OnStar has been used to stop a chase. Not the thief's only bad luck. He tried to run away on foot but was caught after he fell into a backyard swimming pool. It is MORNING EDITION.
