 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Robert Siegel.  And I am Michele Norris. The Obama administration today announced tighter rules for airlines to follow as they check passengers' names against the no-fly list. If airlines are informed of a new addition to the list they now have two hours to recheck their passenger manifest. Previously they had 24 hours long enough for the accused Times Square bomber to board a flight Monday night at JFK airport. NPR's Brian Naylor reports.  It was during that window that Shahzad was able to buy a ticket and walk down the jetway onto the Dubai-bound flight. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says now airlines will have to act more quickly to recheck the no-fly lists.  The new rules require that that happen at a two-hour interval if airlines are notified that somebody's been added as a risk to the no-fly list.  Shahzad was pulled from the flight before it left the gate by Customs and Border Protection agents. Gibbs said despite the delay in removing Shahzad the system worked.  You build-in redundancy to a security system to ensure that this - you do not have to have a silver-bullet strategy. So the system is set up so that a series of checks are provided that prevented this person from flying.  Airline security consultant Douglas Laird says those checks are not enough. He says the Transportation Security Administration officers who check your ID and boarding pass should also be looking at the no-fly lists.  Right now they do not know. They have no idea who you are. You show them your boarding pass but they have no way of knowing that that boarding pass is genuine. You could print those out at home.  Brian Naylor NPR News Washington.
