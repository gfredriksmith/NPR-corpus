 Let us get a sneak preview now of a coming attraction.   Mongolia is the land of Genghis Khan and nomadic herders.   And it is also now riding a mining boom.   All next week NPR's Frank Langfitt takes us to Mongolia where the rush to extract mineral resources is transforming a nomadic culture.  We will probably become the third largest copper and gold mine in the world.    We all understand the significance of the project. We do hope that every Mongolian can benefit.   Our series on Mongolia's mining boom begins Monday.   It is PR News.
