You are going to stick around so Puzzle will be a part of Sunday no matter what. All right. Well as we do every week you remind us of the challenge you gave out to our listeners last week.  Yes. It came from listener Eric Iverson of Eagan Minnesota. I said take the name of a nationality write it in lower-case letters remove the first letter rotate one of the remaining letters 180 degrees and the result will be the name of another nationality. What nationalities are these?  What are they?  Well it is Spanish to Danish. Remove the S from Spanish turn that P upside down you get Danish.  Very clever.
