 Good morning. I am A Martinez. They say the best way to win hearts and minds is through food. Canadian politician Jagmeet Singh knows this. That is why he tried to show up to a campaign event with a food truck - a poutine food truck more specifically.

Now rather than take it as bad omen Singh joked the high-quality cheese curds had been too heavy for the truck. It is MORNING EDITION.
