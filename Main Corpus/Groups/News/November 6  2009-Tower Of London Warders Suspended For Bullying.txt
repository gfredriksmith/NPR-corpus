 And today's last word in business is bad Beefeaters. A couple of British security workers have been suspended from their jobs. The two are called Beefeaters or guards at the thousand-year-old Tower of London which houses the famed Crown Jewels. They wear Tudor-era uniforms and also entertain tourists with tales of famous prisoners of the tower. They also apparently bullied one of their colleagues -the first woman ever to join the Beefeater ranks. Earlier this week Tower officials suspended two guards and called the campaign against Moira Cameron totally unacceptable. Then again the place has never been that hospitable to women. The Tower of London is where Anne Boleyn and another wife of King Henry VIII lost their heads.
