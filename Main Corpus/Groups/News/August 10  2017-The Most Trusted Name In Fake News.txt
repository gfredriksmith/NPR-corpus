 Making fun of the news - it is big business on television. There is The Daily Show. There is The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. There is Bill Maher and of course the grande dame of news satire...   It is Weekend Update with Colin Jost and Michael Che.   We last heard from Che and Jost in May. The hosts of Saturday Night Live's long-running news sketch Weekend Update were finishing up the show is best-rated season in 25 years. And the news was thus.   I know I said this last week but this week was crazy.   Obviously Trump's not done yet. But let us just say Mike Pence is definitely warming up in the bullpen.   After that episode SNL went on what is called a hiatus a break between seasons.  Of course though the news does not take the summer off. So NBC Entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt said he did not want Che and Jost to either. The network did not want to lose their ratings momentum. And so tonight Che and Jost are going to host a half-hour version of Weekend Update in prime time. It airs on Thursdays. OK not the weekend exactly. But still it is going to be airing on Thursdays for the next four weeks.  It is not the first time SNL has spun-off Weekend Update to accommodate some appetite for satire. Back in October 2008 when Barack Obama and Joe Biden were running against John McCain and Sarah Palin Amy Poehler and Seth Meyers were the Weekend Update host team.   Amy do you want to do Governor Palin's part instead?  I guess I could give it a try I mean...  Do you want - do you remember it?  I kind of remember it yeah.  OK why do not you try it?  One two three.    My name is Sarah Palin. You all know me vice president nominee of the GOP. Going to need your vote in the next election. Can I get a what what from the senior section? McCain...  So I guess we can say the most-trusted names in fake news are back on NBC tonight.
