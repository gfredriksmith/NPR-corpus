 People have been drinking beer for a very very long time but it is been tough to know exactly what ancient beer tasted like.  Leave it to some college students to figure it out. A group of students at Stanford University recently brewed up a batch of beer that was made from a 5000-year-old recipe.  And honestly it did not sound all that great.  It is not like a beer in the sense that we see like a Heineken or a Tsingtao beer. It is like a porridge.  A boozy porridge - ew.  Li Liu is a professor of Chinese archaeology at Stanford. She helped analyze the residue left on the inside of ancient vats and funnels unearthed at an ancient brewery in China to figure out the ingredients used for the drink.  Then she had her students recreate the fermented porridge.  Well the idea is for them to - firsthand to understand the lifeway of ancient people.  The recipe calls for grains of millet and barley along with yam lily root and a type of Chinese grass sometimes called Job's tears.  The result - a thick beverage that is low in alcohol but rich in nutrients with a sour and sweet flavor.  I think the early beer is not just for drink. It is a food.  You will not be able to buy Professor Liu's beer at a bar anytime soon but the students who brewed it are not old enough to buy it there anyway.   No but we did not really drink so people just tasted. We just used a very thin straw and sipped a little bit and taste the flavor.  And judging from what we have heard about that flavor it is not clear Professor Liu's next archaeological keg party would draw much of a crowd.
