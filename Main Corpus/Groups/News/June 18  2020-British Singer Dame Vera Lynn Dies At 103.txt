 The British singer Dame Vera Lynn has died at the age of 103. Her voice lifted the spirits of British troops fighting overseas during World War II.    There'ill be bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover tomorrow. Just you wait and see.  That was The White Cliffs Of Dover. Her music was not just played by troops on the frontline. When British cities were bombed people played her songs in their homes and they found hope.    We will meet again. Do not know where do not know when but I know we will meet again some sunny day.  What a voice. That is a classic - We will Meet Again. Vera Lynn died today at the age of 103.    Just like you always do.
