 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. When high waves flipped over Ryan Hunter Harris' fishing boat off the coast of Alaska his crewmate got back to shore in a survival suit. Harris was not so lucky. He spent the next 26 hours adrift in a plastic bin used to store fish. Eventually another fishing crew picked him up. Harris told Reuters he kept his spirits up singing songs including Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and of course Row Row Row Your Boat. It is MORNING EDITION.
