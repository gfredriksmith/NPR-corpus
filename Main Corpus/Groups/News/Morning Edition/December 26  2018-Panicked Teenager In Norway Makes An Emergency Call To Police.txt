 Good morning. I am Noel King. Police in Norway say they recently got a call from a panicked teenager. He would managed somehow to lock himself inside of a car a car that he was trying to steal. Turns out the kid has a history of petty theft and calling the police to spring him was a bit like calling a friend for help says a police spokesman. He said the teenager's tried to steal cars before but at least he was able to get himself back out those other times.
