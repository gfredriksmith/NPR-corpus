 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Witnesses in Stamford Connecticut could be forgiven for thinking they fell into an old episode of The Super Friends. A guy dressed as Spider-Man got into a brawl with Captain America. We do not know what started them fighting in a parking garage. We do know the fight also involved a woman dressed as the comic-book eco-terrorist Poison Ivy. Police arrested all three characters including the woman whose real name is Nicole Bitterly. It is MORNING EDITION.
