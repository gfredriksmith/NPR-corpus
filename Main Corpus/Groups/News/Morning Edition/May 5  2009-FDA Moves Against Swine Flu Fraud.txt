 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with the economic possibilities of swine flu. The Food and Drug Administration says it is found at least 20 Web sites selling products to guard against the flu. One site offered the SilverCure Swine Flu Protection Pack. For one low price of 199 you too could own shampoo lotion conditioner and soap. They supposedly deposit traces of silver which according to the FDA is not proven to do anything. It is MORNING EDITION.
