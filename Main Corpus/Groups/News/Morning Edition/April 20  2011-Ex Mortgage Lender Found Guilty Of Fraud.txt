 NPR's business news starts with a guilty verdict for mortgage fraud.   In one of the few prosecutions linked to the housing meltdown the former chairman of a major mortgage lender was convicted of fraud yesterday. Lee Farkas was chairman of Taylor Bean and Whitaker. Prosecutors say Farkas orchestrated a long-running scheme that cheated investors and the government out of billions of dollars and caused a major bank to collapse. Farkas now faces decades in prison.
