 Here's some numbers to keep in mind as you wait for results to roll in today. The day begins with Democrats in charge of both houses of Congress. In the House Republicans would need to gain 39 seats to capture control.  They have many opportunities to do that. As many as 100 House seats are considered competitive.  In the Senate Republicans would need 10 seats to get control. If the chamber should end up dead even a tie would go to the Democrats since Vice President Joe Biden would get the tie-breaking vote.  The Democratic leader in the Senate is among those fighting for his job. Nevada's Harry Reid is in a close race with Republican Sharron Angle.  Republicans have a good shot to win President Obama's old Senate seat in Illinois.  In Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski is waging a write-in campaign after her loss in the primary.  And it is not just Senate and House races today 37 governors' races are in the mix this year and one of them is in the state of California Renee.  Democrat Jerry Brown is ahead in the polls against Meg Whitman who has spent more than 140 million of her own money in the race.
