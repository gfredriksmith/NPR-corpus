 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Here's material for a sequel to Jerry Springer The Opera. Jerry Springer's TV show is still on the air. The other day Richard Peterson appeared and boasted about a one-night stand with a stripper. The stripper was on the show as was Peterson's girlfriend who took a swing at him. All good clean fun except that Peterson's North Carolina probation officer was watching the show. He is been jailed for three days for leaving the state. It is MORNING EDITION.
