 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Tens of thousands of complaints have been filed with the Better Business Bureau about a telemarketing call warning that your car warranty is about to expire.

Now the senator's making a call of his own to the Federal Trade Commission calling for an investigation. It is MORNING EDITION.
