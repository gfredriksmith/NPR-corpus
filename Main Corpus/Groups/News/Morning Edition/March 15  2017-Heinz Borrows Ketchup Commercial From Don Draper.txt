 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. Remember on Mad Men when Don Draper had an idea for a Heinz ketchup ad?    It is clean it is simple and it is tantalizingly incomplete.

But now it is won over the actual Heinz ketchup company. Heinz plans to take the fictional ad campaign and make it real - art imitating life imitating art. It is MORNING EDITION.
