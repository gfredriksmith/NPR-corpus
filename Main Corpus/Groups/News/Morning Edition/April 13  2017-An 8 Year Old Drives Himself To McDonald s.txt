 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. And you know sometimes you just really need a cheeseburger. Case in point one Sunday night after his parents had fallen asleep a kid in Ohio took his dad's van and drove his sister to McDonald's. No big deal right? Except the kid was just 8 years old. The child reportedly drove through four intersections and over some railroad tracks. Police showed up just as the kids were finishing their cheeseburgers. The 8-year-old said he learned to drive by watching YouTube. It is MORNING EDITION.
