 Our last word in business today is dot free for all. The group that governs Internet names is allowing for more top-level domain names - that is the technical term for endings like dot-com and dot-net. Nearly 2000 applications poured in from companies hoping to grab domain name endings like dot-app dot-eat and dot-baby. Google went all out spending more than 18 million to apply for the rights to obvious endings like dot-google and dot-goog. But Google also applied to own dot-love. Hmm. Well in any case there could be romantic friction between six other companies who want dot-love as well. Someone may have to settle for dot-L-U-V.
