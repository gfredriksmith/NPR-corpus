 And a similar offer of money has propped up some Head Start programs. Laura and John Arnold of Houston Texas pledged up to 10 million to keep the program running in six states.  Head Start is a preschool program for kids from low-income families. And on Friday it closed down in many places when the government partially stopped. This is how the parent of a Head Start child Laura Bastion heard the news.  Like oh you know hey thanks for picking your kid up on time. But you cannot bring her back after Monday because we are not going to be here.  Laura Bastion lives in Tallahassee Fla. with her three daughters. Her 3-year-old is enrolled in Head Start.  Now Ms. Bastion's mom took care of her daughter while Head Start was shut down. But it was not a long-term option. So it was a relief when Bastion heard Head Start was coming back.  It was kind of a thank God moment like OK my child can go back to school. So that just takes all this weight off of me of worrying and stressing being a single mom. I am already stressed enough.   You know the couple that donated this money they were a godsend.  That is parent Laura Bastion from Tallahassee Fla.
