 The Tea Party got a big win yesterday in Texas. Its candidate for a U.S. Senate race won the Republican primary. Ted Cruz is the former state's solicitor general. He defeated the lieutenant governor who was backed by the governor Rick Perry.  Ted Cruz received millions of dollars in backing from national conservative groups. And now he is the Republican nominee and heavy favorite to win this fall a Canadian-born Texan with Cuban ancestry.
