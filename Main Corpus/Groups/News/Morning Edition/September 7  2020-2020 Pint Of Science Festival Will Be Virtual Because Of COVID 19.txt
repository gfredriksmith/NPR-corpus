 Here's a chance to study astrophysics while drinking a cold beer. That is pretty much how it works at Pint of Science Festival which typically takes place in pubs and cafes in the U.K. and around the world. Praveen Paul is one of the co-founders.  Well we usually held a festival which takes place in bars cafes and pubs and public spaces where people can go and hear about the latest research in science and chat with the scientists.  The goal is for scientists and the public to meet face to face and talk about science in a more casual setting that is not so intimidating. But in 2020 face-to-face is not happening.  Pint of Science will now be online this year. So we will not be in restaurants cafes pubs or any public place for that matter. But we will be online.  That is Ph.D. student De-Shaine Murray. He is hosting a panel discussion during the festival between Black scientists. It is called Skin Society Science. And he hopes that having the festival online will get even wider audience participation.  We are scientists. We serve the public. A lot of the science we do will actually end up affecting the public. So it is important that they know about the cool science or the great things that we do.  There are talks on a wide range of topics including artificial intelligence. There is a discussion called Paleontology Rocks! .  I love my dad jokes.  .  Praveen Paul says some of the topics might seem daunting at first.  Things like you know why do we exist? How big is the universe? That might get easier with  having a drink to accompany it.  OK. So the festival runs through Friday. And scientists from more than 15 countries are planning to log in for a virtual Pint of Science.
