 Good morning. I am David Greene. A substitute teacher in New Jersey will not be returning to work. NJ.com reports she told first-graders that Santa Claus is not real. This led to a discussion in the class about the Easter Bunny the tooth fairy The Elf on the Shelf. She said they are fake too. The principal of the school said she showed poor judgment. Now we have had an unofficial policy on our program to never question Santa's existence on the air because - well because.
