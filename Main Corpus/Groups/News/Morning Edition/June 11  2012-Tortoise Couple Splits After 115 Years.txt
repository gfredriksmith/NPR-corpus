 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. After 115 years together one couple is calling it quits. Bibi and Poldi are giant tortoises who bonded when they were young. But after more than a century together Bibi decided she would had enough. She began biting her partner's shell. The staff at the Austrian zoo said they are not sure what caused the break up. Animal behaviorists have tried bonding games and aphrodisiacs to reunite the pair but so far no luck. It is MORNING EDITION.
