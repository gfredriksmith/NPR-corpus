 Good morning. I am Linda Wertheimer. A Minnesota teen became the most generous kid at school. He passed out thousands of dollars in 100 bills. For example he slipped 1200 into the bag of a school bus aide. He first said the money was his allowance. Now police say the student found the cash in a ditch where drug dealers probably hid it. Police think he just wanted to help people though they took back his donations as evidence. It is MORNING EDITION.
