  NPR's business news starts with a bit of relief for Haiti.   The International Monetary Fund says Haiti is off the hook for the nearly 270 million it owes the fund. In addition to cancelling the debt the IMF will also lend Haiti another 60 million. That loan would be to boost reconstruction in the country which is still devastated by the earthquake six months ago. More than one and a half million people are living in camps now and reconstruction efforts are moving slowly.
