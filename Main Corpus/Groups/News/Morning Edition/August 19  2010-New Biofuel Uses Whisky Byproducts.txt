 And today's last word in business is Scotch power. Alcohol and driving definitely should not mix but scientists in Scotland are hoping to harness the power of their country's national drink to fuel cars. Researchers at Edinburgh's Napier University say they have developed a new biofuel that uses whiskey byproducts - the stuff left over from the whiskey-making process. The scientists say their new fuel is 30 percent more powerful than traditional biofuels and it does not eat up valuable farmlands which has been a criticism of ethanol and other crop-based biofuels. And of course like many good whiskeys it would normally be consumed as a blend - five or 10 percent whiskey the rest traditional gasoline. I was not drinking officer. It was my car.
