 Good morning. I am David Greene. Have you had enough of Twitter? Think it is whittled our lives down to 140 characters. Well prepare to be more unnerved. The publisher Penguin has commissioned a new volume of books. Well if you can call them books. Two college students are compressing literary classics into 20 tweets or less. It is called Twitterature. Guess we have got the Cliff Notes of the 21st century. If you have got a short attention span and you want to enjoy Shakespeare well have at it. It is MORNING EDITION.
