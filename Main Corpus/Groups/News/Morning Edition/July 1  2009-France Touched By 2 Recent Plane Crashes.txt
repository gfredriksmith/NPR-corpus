 Eleanor Beardsley sent this report.  Unidentified Man    Jalifa Yusuf and Jean Abood who had relatives on the flight said everyone had been expecting such an accident due to the deplorable state of the planes that fly from Yemen to the Comoros.   Nobody wanted to hear our message about these coffins that are taking us to the Comoros. We are not here as victims. We are here to denounce the way this company treats us.   The treat us like dogs. They change planes on us in Yemen and pack us into these wrecks that are nothing but flying coffins.  But pilot and air safety specialist Chris Roberts says you cannot make things better by simply creating a black list unless you have a follow-up system to go with it.  Once you have found an airplane somewhere which is deemed to be deficient by a certain group of agents or regulators then the airline concerned should have to present that airplane internationally somewhere in order for it to be given a clean bill of health. Otherwise the whole airline should be stopped flying.  That about sums it up says aeronautics expert Jean-Pierre Rotelli.   When you as a tourist leave France and fly on a domestic carrier in Africa or South America or Southeast Asia you will probably be flying on an airline that should be black listed but is not because its few good planes fly to Europe.
