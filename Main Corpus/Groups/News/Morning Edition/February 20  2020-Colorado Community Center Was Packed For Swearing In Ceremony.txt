 Good morning. I am David Greene. You might not expect a small-town politician's swearing-in ceremony to bring a crowd but the community center in Georgetown Colo. was packed this week for the inauguration of a new mayor. He wore a tie and glasses and not much else. Parker the Snow Dog is a ski mountain mascot a good boy and now an honorary mayor. He is got a thousand constituents in Georgetown nearly 17000 followers on Instagram. His platform includes love hugs and cookies.
