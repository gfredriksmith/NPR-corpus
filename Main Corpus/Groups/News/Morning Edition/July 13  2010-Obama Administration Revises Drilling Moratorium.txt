 This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. Good morning. I am Renee Montagne.  And I am Mary Louise Kelly. The Obama administration has again issued a moratorium on new deep-water oil drilling. The federal courts blocked the administration's earlier ban as an overreaction to the BP oil spill. NPR's Scott Horsley reports.  The new moratorium effectively keeps a lid on deep-water drilling in the Gulf through the end of November. But this time the administration has gone to greater lengths to justify its action. The Interior Department cites what it calls new evidence that deep-water blowout preventers are not as fail-safe as they were thought to be. It also suggests the industry would be hard-pressed to cope with another spill since cleanup crews are already stretched thin responding to BP's. White House spokesman Robert Gibbs says given those concerns it makes sense to hold off drilling for now.  We know that that is now without some economic consequences to the region. But it is imperative that we have a sense of what happened before we continue to do this again.  The administration says it is open to lifting the moratorium before November 30th but only if the industry shows it can drill safely. Scott Horsley NPR News the White House.
