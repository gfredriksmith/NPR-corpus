 Good morning. I am David Greene. The mayor of Warren Mich. Jim Fouts has a favor to ask. If you see him jogging do not bother him. Apparently a woman barged into Mayor Fouts' office and was furious he had not stopped to talk to her. So he took to Facebook and explained that to keep his heart healthy he has this cardio routine one that ideally means not stopping on every block. He said he really is available to people 247 although I guess in reality it is like 237. It is MORNING EDITION.
