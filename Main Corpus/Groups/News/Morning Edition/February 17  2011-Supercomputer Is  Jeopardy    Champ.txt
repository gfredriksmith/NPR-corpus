  On the TV game show Jeopardy! this week an IBM computer named Watson took on two humans. Last night was the final round and the humans - including show host Alex Trebek - could only shake their heads in awe.  Mr.  Even a broken one of these on your wall is right twice a day. Watson.  What is clock? Mr.  Clock is correct. And with that you move up to 23000...   Our last word in business today The machine won. Watson took the million dollar prize which will go to charity. And Watson is now going to work. He will be researching medical data at two hospitals. Of course if you are worried about the future of human beings do not worry because sooner or later that smart machine is going to say Stop giving my pay to charity. I want a plasma TV. Watson will start spending all of its time noodling around on the Internet and stop thinking. People can catch up. That is the business news on PR News. I am Steve Inskeep.
