 Good morning. I am Noel King. A lot of us have tossed a coin or two into a fountain after making a wish. The North Carolina Aquarium at Pine Knoll Shores is finally cashing in some of those wishes more than 10 years worth of loose change from their indoor waterfall. They collected 100 gallons of coins. How much money is that? I do not actually know. The aquarium asked people to guess. And the answers will be revealed this week. It is MORNING EDITION.
