 NPR's business news starts with a warning about U.S. bonds.   The credit rating agency Moody's said it has put the U.S. government's bond rating on revenue for a possible downgrade. The agency cited the rising possibility that the government's debt limits will not be raised in time to prevent the U.S. from running out of money to pay its debts.  President Obama and lawmakers are struggling to reach agreements on reducing the federal budget that is part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling. U.S. government bonds have long been seen as one of the safest investments in the world so a downgrade to their credit worthiness would be unprecedented.  It would also push up rates on treasury bonds making it costlier for the U.S. government to borrow.
