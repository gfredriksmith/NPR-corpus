 Good morning I am David Greene. At MORNING EDITION we have eaten plenty of donuts especially at 3 in the morning. Well now we know why we have reached for those glazed temptations. A new study from the University of California Berkeley suggests sleep deprivation leads to poor food choices. Researchers found the part of the brain that enables good decisions gets hazy after an all-nighter. The part that craves rewards is revved up for more. Right now I am holding a granola bar with a vanilla topping - whatever that tells you. It is MORNING EDITION.
