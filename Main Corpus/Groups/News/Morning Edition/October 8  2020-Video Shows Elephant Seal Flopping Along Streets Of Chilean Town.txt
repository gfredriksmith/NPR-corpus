 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Some people would rather wander for hours than admit they are lost and maybe that was the case with an elephant seal which took a wrong turn into a Chilean town this week. Video shows the enormous creature flopping along neighborhood streets - normally lives at the edge of the water or in it. The seal was safely carried back to the water on a tarp by the Chilean police and navy which means it became a navy SEAL. I am here all week. It is MORNING EDITION.
