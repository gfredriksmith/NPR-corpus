 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with a celebration of failure. Archaeologists at the University of Michigan have organized it. They made a display of flawed artifacts. They show off stone carvings that cracked and ceramic vessels that warped. The curator says we can learn a lot from the mistakes of past generations and she calls this exhibit least than perfect.  Steve I think that is less than perfect.  Darn it now I have to do it again.  No I would just leave it.  It is MORNING EDITION.
