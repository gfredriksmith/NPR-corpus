 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. A grateful nation thanks the Salahis for giving us so much to talk about. The couple who crashed a White House party went to court because they owed money to a landscaper. Tareq Salahi handed over his Patek Philippe watch. His lawyer said it was worth enough to cover the 2000 debt. A jeweler found it was an imitation worth 100 or less. The Salahis have since paid the debt the old-fashioned way by writing a check. It is MORNING EDITION.
