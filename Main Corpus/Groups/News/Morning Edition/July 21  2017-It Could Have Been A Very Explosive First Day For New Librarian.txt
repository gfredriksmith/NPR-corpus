 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with the exciting life of a librarian. Abby Noland had just started a job directing the library in Gleason Mass. And when moving into her office she discovered artillery shells live ammunition. The Boston Globe says they were part of a collection from the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863 donated to the town long ago and apparently stuck in a closet. The bomb squad took away the shells and safely blew them up - possibly the final shots of the Civil War. It is MORNING EDITION.
