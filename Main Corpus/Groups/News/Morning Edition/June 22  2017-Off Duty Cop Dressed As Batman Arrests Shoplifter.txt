 Good morning. I am David Greene. In Gotham City two words are a criminal's nightmare.    I am Batman.  But in Fort Worth Texas - I am not kidding here - a guy trying to shoplift DVDs was apprehended by Batman - well actually off-duty cop Damon Cole who does community events dressed as superheroes. This must have been especially weird for the suspect because as Officer Cole told Fox 4 he is apparently a fan.   One of the movies he was attempting to steal was Lego Batman. You cannot steal my movie. Come on.  It is MORNING EDITION.
