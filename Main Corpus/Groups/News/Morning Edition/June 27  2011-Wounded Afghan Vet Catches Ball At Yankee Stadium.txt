 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with congratulations to Michael Kacer. He is an American veteran who lost his left arm in a rocket attack that happened in Afghanistan. But Mr. Kacer still has one good arm and demonstrated how good at Yankee Stadium on Friday night. He was in the stands when a foul ball spun his way. Kacer reached over the railing and snatched the ball with his hat. His nephew got the ball and Mr. Kacer was shown repeatedly on television. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
