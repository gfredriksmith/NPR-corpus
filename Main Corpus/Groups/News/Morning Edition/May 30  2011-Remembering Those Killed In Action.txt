 Members of the military are still dying in Iraq even as the U.S. is drawing down its presence there. Twenty-four have been killed in Iraq so far this year. In Afghanistan the U.S. death toll this year has topped 150. One of those was Staff Sergeant Edward Mills Jr. He was 29 years old and one of six soldiers who died last Thursday in Kandahar Province by an improvised explosive device. Sergeant Mills was from New Castle Pennsylvania where his younger brother remembered him as a natural-born leader. This is Morning Edition from NPR News.
