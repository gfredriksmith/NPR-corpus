 Good morning. I am David Greene. King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was credited with modernizing his country in the '60s and '70s. He was not however a member of the Jedi Council but a new textbook has a photo of the king in 1945 sitting next to Yoda.    You must feel the force around you.  The artist who superimposed the Star Wars character said he has no idea how his art accidentally showed up in a textbook though he says both the king and Yoda were wise and strong. It is MORNING EDITION.
