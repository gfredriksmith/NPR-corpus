 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. Most of us have been there - you board the plane and end up sitting next to that parent with a beautiful little baby who starts out cooing and 30 minutes into the flight is wailing like a banshee. I empathize. I have been this parent so many times. Japan Airlines now allows you to actually see a map where babies or toddlers are going to be sitting so you can avoid them in your seat selection. You know what is even nicer? Giving that parent a smile and maybe buying them a mini bottle of wine.
