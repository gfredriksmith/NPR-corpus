 And while you are on social media you can cast a vote for San Francisco's ugliest yard. It is a contest not started by a grouchy neighbor. It is actually sponsored by the city's Department of Environment to promote water conservation. Spokesman Guillermo Rodriguez says an ugly yard is a chance to reconsider what makes a yard beautiful.  And beautiful to us is a yard that has native plants can support biodiversity and are drought tolerant.  That is the ideal - plants that do not need a ton of water. Lush green lawns are fast going out of style here in bone-dry California. Ugly yard contestants are competing for a landscaping makeover with drought-tolerant plants. They have uploaded photos to the city's Facebook page. Ian Hart is one of them. He submitted a photo of what he calls his former lawn. Due to the drought it is now mostly dirt and thorny weeds.  We would love to have a low-water makeover and have something that was both drought tolerant but would also support our kids playing in the yard. And we have had a lot of funny comments from our neighbors who are supporting us in our effort to have the city's ugliest lawn.  But Hart is up against some tough competition. Another contestant wrote - my yard is so ugly I do not even have to decorate on Halloween. It already looks scary.
