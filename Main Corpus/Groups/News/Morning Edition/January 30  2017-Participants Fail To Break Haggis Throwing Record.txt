 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. There was an athletic contest this weekend that measures physical strength steely will and the chance for national glory. All you had to do was throw a piece of haggis more than 270 feet and thus set a new world record. This annual haggis throwing tradition happens in Scotland of course where the dish of spiced sheep's organs is considered a delicacy. The prize for beating the world record was a lifetime supply of haggis. No one was able to do it which makes me wonder if they were really trying. It is MORNING EDITION.
