 All right. You may or may not like what I am about to tell you. Twitter has announced a change. The star button you used to favorite tweets is being replaced by a heart button. Clicking on the heart means you like a tweet. Some Twitter users do not like this change. Journalist Casey Newton from the tech website The Verge told us what he saw when he logged on yesterday.  Well I saw a disaster which is that all of the stars on Twitter had been replaced by hearts.  There you have it. Newton explains that what made the favorite button special to him was that it could mean so many different things.  Some people used favorites to bookmark tweets so they could find them later. Some people used them to express that they agreed with a tweet. And then one of my favorite uses of the favorite was what is sometimes called the hate fav which is when somebody would insult you on Twitter you would favorite it hoping that they would see that you had favorited it. And that would confuse and upset them.  And Newton says all of this sprung up organically.  The favorite was something that the community kind of figured out how to use. And then over time it helped to make Twitter a really distinctive original service. And with hearts they made it a little bit more like everything else.  But Twitter sees things differently. They say the heart is more expressive enabling you to convey a range of emotions and easily connect with people.
