 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Theodore Roosevelt said it is not the critic who counts but the man who was actually in the arena. In Madison Wisconsin the man in the arena was Brandon Hochstrasser. And in this case the arena was really a sidewalk. He is a street musician. When a passer-by criticized his music Mr. Hochstrasser fought back. He smashed the critic over the head with his guitar. And he remained in the arena fighting until removed by police who used a stun gun. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
