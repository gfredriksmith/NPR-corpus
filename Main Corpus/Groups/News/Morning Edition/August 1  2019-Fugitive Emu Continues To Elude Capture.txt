 Good morning. I am David Greene with an update on a fugitive in North Carolina. For the last five weeks Eno the emu has evaded capture and is running free in Orange County. Animal Services spokesperson Tenille Fox said the flightless bird can run up to 30 miles an hour so people should not try to chase it. Eno was last seen jumping on the hood of a car and taunting a driver. Animal Services sent a plea out to residents - quote if this is your emu let us know.
