    L is for the way you look at me. O...          Thank you very much all of you for being here.  Pleasure being here.  Pleasure being here.  Muchas gracias.  Issac let me start with you. You grew up in Cuba. How did you discover Nat King Cole?  Nat King Cole .  He says that Nat King Cole is a myth an icon for his generation and that he listened to him home. His father actually had a physical resemblance to Cole and that his mother loved to play his music around the house. When Cole came to Cuba he seduced everyone. He had the uncanny ability to make you feel that he was singing right to your ear that he was singing especially for you.     Let us turn to Freddie Cole. Freddie do you know why your brother was so interested in Latin music and Latin America?  Well his personal manager at the time was a Spanish person Carlos Gastel. And you know they started to talk about this project and they put it together and it became one of the bestsellers that Nat had in his whole career.     Nat Chediak you produced this tribute recording. How did the idea come about?  I was actually working with Issac on another project and he said I want to do Cole Espanol.  Did you know what he was talking about?  Instantly. You know there is no self-respecting Latin who comes from the world of music who does not know Nat King Cole. I mean it is just unheard of.   Let us just take a sampling here and try two versions of the Latin standard Perfidia. We will hear first Nat King Cole and then we will here Issac Delgado.       Issac the differences are really interesting. I mean you do - you have beautiful voice. You are obviously not imitating Nat King Cole. And there is a little bit of - I do not know. You seem to sort of ease into the rhythm of it in a different way.   We did not want to make a carbon copy of what had already been done before. So we wanted to be respectful but at the same time do it in our own way.  This album includes two duets with Issac and Freddy Cole. We are just going to listen for a second to Green Eyes.    But will they ever want me? Green Eyes make my dreams come true.    Freddie did you ever sing with your brother?  No. I played piano on some of his records. I was on the My Fair Lady CD.    I have grown accustomed to her face.  One of our mindsets...  That is Nat Chediak.  One of the mindsets in putting the repertory was we went beyond the three Latino albums and we reached out to standards whole standards that he never did in Spanish because we wanted to extend it to the entire Cole songbook.     Issac I have to say that if I did not know that song I would think it sounds perfect in Spanish.    He is very happy that people respond to it because when they know the song in English they do not have a reference for it in Spanish. And for them to accept it is very gratifying for him.  Freddie if I were to ask you to pick a song in particular that brings back memories of your brother would it be that one?  Oh I love this particular song. But I have so many memories of my brother it would take all day your whole time for the show...   ...because he was such a great musician. And he had such an awareness of everything around him and he knew how to color here and do this and do that. So it really would be unfair for me to just jump up and try to pick one thing.   Freddie Cole Issac Delgado and Nat Chediak thank you all very much.  Thank you.  Muchas gracias.  Their album is a tribute to Nat King Cole in Spanish. It is called L.O.V.E.    This is PR News.
