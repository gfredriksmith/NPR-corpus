 So two major business stories are the end of the Harry Potter film series and the News Corp. scandal. Since both are set in Britain it is inevitable that people see parallels.  A Harry Potter book written years ago includes a nasty underhanded tabloid newspaper reporter - a woman named Rita Skeeter. She does anything for a sleazy story.  In fact it is discovered that she has engaged in hidden surveillance of her subjects she plants a bug. Or actually she magically turns herself into a bug - a beetle - and listens into people. But in the end she is caught and trapped in a glass jar.  News Corp. executive Rebekah Brooks was famous for doing anything for a story. Today she is lost her job after critics said she took that honorable impulse too far.   And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News.  I am Mary Louise Kelly.  And I am Steve Inskeep.
