 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. Commuters in Vienna Austria have spoken. They like the way their subway smells. The city's transit authority recently tested out four new lovely scents in the ventilation systems of four trains - green tea grapefruit sandalwood and melon. An online poll was held to choose the winning fragrance and the majority of voters said they preferred a non-perfume commute. I guess to them it just did not make any sense.
