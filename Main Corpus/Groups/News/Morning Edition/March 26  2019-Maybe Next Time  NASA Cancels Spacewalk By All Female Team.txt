 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. This Friday the first all-female team was supposed to conduct a spacewalk at the International Space Station to carry out some repairs. NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch were all set to make history - except for one thing. Both astronauts need medium-sized space suits and there is only one on the station that is prepped to use. So Koch will now go out with a male astronaut. So hey NASA we want to see more women in space. How about making sure they have something to wear when they get up there?
