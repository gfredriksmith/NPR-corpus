 NPR's business news starts with ballot measures and the economy.   Voters weighed in on a number of economic issues yesterday. In Colorado voters rejected a trio of measures that would have cut taxes and limited government borrowing. Both political parties in the state opposed the initiatives. The voters in Colorado also rejected a state amendment that would have challenged the new federal health care law. But voters in Arizona and Oklahoma supported similar measures against the health care bill.
