   If it snows and school is canceled do not fret. You can come over to my house watch Goonies at my house...  This is the voice of Sarah Dooley. We are introducing you to her music this morning. She became a campus celebrity as an undergraduate at Columbia University. She won over Internet critics with a comedy Web series called And Sarah. Her debut album is just out now. It is called Stupid Things.    You sit there. I will sit here. Can you see I am so happy you are watching Goonies at my house. It is just that I have been waiting ...  Sarah's sensibility combines sweetness and irony with some irreverent lyrics. She lives in Brooklyn now but was raised in Indiana on a steady diet of comedy.  We used to listen to Steve Martin's comedy album on road trips. And we also -  typical Midwestern fashion - would pull the TV around for dinner time and watch The Simpsons or you know Seinfeld.  Her Midwestern childhood which she describes as idyllic figures heavily on the album.  Like a group by a cornfield and there was a 24-hour diner on the corner.  And that meant when she moved to New York City at age 19 it was a bit of a wake-up call.  Her song Willow Tree plays on some of that disillusionment.    Peter Pan is all grown up. He is a dentist in downtown Chicago. And the Tooth Fairy OD'd on noxious fumes. The mocking bird is Argon material and where shadows sleep in a separate room... I think I find inspiration in the transition between childhood and adulthood.  That is Sarah Dooley. Her new album Stupid Things is out now.    Riding on the subway there is no room for us. Riding on the subway make some room for me and my friends. Trying another car try another car there is no room....
