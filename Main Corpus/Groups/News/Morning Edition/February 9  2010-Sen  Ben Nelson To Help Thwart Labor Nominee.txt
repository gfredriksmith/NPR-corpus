 A fair number of President Obama's nominees for government posts have not been confirmed. They are caught up in Senate politics. There are more than 200 such cases right now and NPR's Peter Overby looks at one nominee who is scheduled for a Senate vote.  Within days after Becker was nominated business groups accused of views on labor law that were extreme and alarming. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce accurately tagged his former employer the Service Employees International Union as one of the most aggressive unions in the U.S.  No one expected Obama to appoint a conservative.  Randy Johnson is a senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber.  It was like sort of a poke in the eye I guess.  By the way until the NLRB gets three more board members it does not even have a legal quorum. Republicans got their hearing on Becker last week but if anything has changed it is hard to see. Committee chairman Tom Harkin of Iowa did the reintroduction.  He has met personally with any senator who has requested it. He has answered more than 280 written questions from this committee.  And the ranking Republican at the hearing Georgia's Johnny Isakson renewed the business allegations.  Just yesterday the committee received two letters in opposition to Mr. Becker's nomination one from 23 major trade associations representing millions of American employers another from 600 manufacturers nationwide.  Becker again told the senators what he would told them in private that he would scrupulously avoid conflict of interest. McCain scoffed as he had before.  That is not good enough. That is not good enough.  And Democrat Al Franken of Minnesota took a swipe at McCain.  I guess this was really the result of the insistence of a member who put a hold on this process. Did that senator during all these months and months submit any of those written questions?  Peter Overby NPR News Washington.
