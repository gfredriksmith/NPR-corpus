 Good morning. I am David Greene. Remember that Chris Farley character from Saturday Night Live - the motivational speaker who lived in a van down by the river? Well visitors to New York can now spend the night in a van down by the East River. A listing on Airbnb offers bed space in several vans in Long Island City ranging in price from 22 to 99. The vans lack almost every amenity. One guest commented that quote not being able to shower was definitely a negative seeing as New York is not very clean. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
