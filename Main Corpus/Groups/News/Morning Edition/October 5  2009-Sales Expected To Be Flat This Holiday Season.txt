 NPR's business news starts with some forecast for holiday shopping.   It is just around the corner. Industry analysts are predicting that this year's sales during the critical holiday shopping season will be flat or down a percent. The Wall Street Journal reports that big store chains are already adjusting their inventories so they do not end up with too much stock on their hands. Department stores are expected to have an especially tough time while lower priced chains like Marshalls may do better. Wal-Mart is pushing its list of 10 holiday toys and Toys R Us says one of its early hot sellers is an 8 to 10 battery-operated hamster.
