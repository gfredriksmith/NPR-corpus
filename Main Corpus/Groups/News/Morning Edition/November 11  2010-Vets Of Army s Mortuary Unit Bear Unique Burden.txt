 Jerald Collman was a collection-point officer. His team was the first to receive the dead from the field.  I would go into the refrigeration unit. I would go in there - nobody could hear me. I would scream as loud as I could and nobody knew. I am proud that I did not commit suicide. That is all I can say. I would have liked to have never had the experience. It changed me forever.   Gary Redlinski and Glen Fruendt worked together at an army mortuary near Saigon and here they remember identifying the dead.  You would look for body marks like scars tattoos. It does get to be a strain on you after a while and some guys could not handle it.  You know the Graves Registration is part of the service that if you do not want to be in it you do not have to be.  You can get out of it yeah.  They cannot keep you in it.  The mortuary part they always consider it to be demoralizing to the troops that are out in the field fighting. So they kind of just keep us hidden. About five years ago I remember meeting a guy he was an infantryman. And when I told him I worked at the mortuary down in Tan Son Nhut near Saigon he said we never knew you guys existed. They thought whoever died they sent them right back to the States.  Do you have nightmares? I said No but I have daymares. The things guys dream about at night I think about 24 hours a day and it is there while I am awake.  What would you like people to know about the work you did Gary?  Probably the fact that I was there to help their son get back home. It did not matter that people did not know we were there. We were there to do our job.  And our job was to take care of the soldiers that came in from the field and to treat them as if they were family.   On this morning after Veteran's Day we were listening to Gary Redlinski and Glen Fruendt at StoryCorps in St. Louis. Their interview will be archived as all interviews are at the library of Congress. The StoryCorps podcast is at npr.org.
