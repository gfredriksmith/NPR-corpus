 Throughout this holiday season we have been hearing about special foods for this time of year a candy called Turkey Joints and a sweet and tangy side called tomato pudding. Today a listener in Davis California tells us about a food tradition that her family continues to keep with a little modification.  Lauren Jabusch is Japanese-American. Once a year she and her family make mochi rice cakes that can be used as dumplings in a savory soup or as a sweet bite-sized dessert.  Traditionally mochi is unsweetened pounded rice and it is a traditional New Year's holiday food. And sometimes you fill it with a sweet bean paste made either of black beans or out of special lima beans that have been peeled.  Lauren's family has been making mochi for generations. She says the recipe starts with soaking grains of rice.  They are soaked overnight then they are drained. The mochi maker that we have first steams the rice and then it has like a little pounder in it that will pound it into a paste for us. And then we shape it by hand into individual balls.  The recipe can be very labor-intensive but over the years Lauren's family has thrown out some of the old-school methods including the need for many cooks in the kitchen.  We actually do not do the traditional over-the-fire-pounding-it-in-a-granite-bowl-with-a-huge-wooden-mallet method anymore. We have a little machine that looks very similar to a bread maker. It is cheating but the big method is a lot of work. It involves a huge group of people and we just do it with our immediate family.  Lauren Jabusch remembers roasting mochi over hot coals with her family when she was a little girl. She says there is nothing like the taste of smoked mochi baked over a fire.  You can see photos of Lauren's great-grandparents gathering to make mochi with the family as well as other holiday food traditions at npr.org.   This is NPR News.
