 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Seventy years ago World War II broke out. That same month a young singer named Vera Lynn recorded a song. We will Meet Again was a poignant ballad for the British boys going off to war. Now the song is back and at 92 Dame Vera is the oldest singer ever to top the British charts.  Ms.   But I know we will meet again  It is MORNING EDITION.  Ms.   on sunny days.
