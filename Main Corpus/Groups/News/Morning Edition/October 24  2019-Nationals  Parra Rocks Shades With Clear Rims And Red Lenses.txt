 Good morning. I am David Greene. If you have been watching the World Series maybe you have wondered about Gerardo Parra's choice of eyewear. The Washington Nationals outfielder rocks these clear frames with red lenses. And it turns out Parra and a few teammates snagged these sunglasses for free at a sparkling water promotion in Detroit. They decided the shades might be lucky. And they are working so far. The Nats are up two games to none. Their vision is clear - win this World Series.
