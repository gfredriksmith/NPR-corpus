 A Japanese company is selling a new smoke alarm for the deaf. In addition to a loud sound the device sprays wasabi or actually the chemical that gives the Japanese horse radish its punch. In tests the spicy smoke alarm reportedly woke up nearly everyone within two and a half minutes. However it is not selling well. Perhaps the price tag is too hard to swallow. It costs more than 500.
