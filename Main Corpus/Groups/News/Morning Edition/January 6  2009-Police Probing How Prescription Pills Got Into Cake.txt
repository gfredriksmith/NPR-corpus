 Good morning I am Ari Shapiro. If I knew you were coming I would have baked a cake and drugged it. A woman who works at a Connecticut home for the disabled made a cake for residents and accidentally spilled prescription pills into the batter. She pulled them out but must have missed some because employees called police when they spotted the drugs in the cake after it was partially eaten. No word on what kind of pills they were or whether the home residents have started acting strange. It is Morning Edition.
