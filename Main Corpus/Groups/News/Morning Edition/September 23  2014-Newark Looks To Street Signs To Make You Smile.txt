 And now this - we have news this morning of an effort to spread a little cheer in a tough world.  Think of it as a follow-up to yesterday's news. We told you on this program that everyday stress like getting angry while driving may shorten some people's lives.  Newark New Jersey is fighting back. The city plans to post happy street signs.  They look like no parking signs except each sign has an upbeat message. For example honk less love more.  And less drugs more hugs.  Or follow dreams not crowds.  Artist Killy Kilford who is based in New York City made these signs with local students.  It developed over the course of the last nine months which has included a number of workshops in high schools around Newark which I have been delivering to curate an environment where young people can express positive messages that will inspire people towards a community of well-being.  This is more controversial than you might think. Last year Mr. Kilford installed happy signs in New York but the outgoing Mayor Michael Bloomberg had them taken down.  I have to say it was the first time I have ever broken the law. I am generally a good boy.  New York City drivers apparently did not want to be told to hug somebody.  You talking to me?  But Newark supports this project. The first sign goes up there in October.
