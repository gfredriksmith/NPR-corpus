 NPR's Martin Kaste reports.  Alasdair Allan says the iPhone 4 is constantly recording its location relative to nearby cell phone towers and Wi-Fi signals. He found the data when he was looking at the files created when you sync your phone with your computer.  I stumbled across a directory that is actually named Location D and I thought well that looks interesting - which was full of latitudes and longitudes and time stamps.  Allan and Warden say the iPhone tracking was already a known piece of inside knowledge among hacker-types but they wanted to make sure everybody was aware of it. Warden says there is no evidence the location information is being sent to anybody else.  So do not panic but we do want to know more about what is happening with this data.  Martin Kaste NPR News.
