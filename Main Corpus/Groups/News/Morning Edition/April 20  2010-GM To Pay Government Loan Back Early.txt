 NPR's business news starts with GM's early payback.   Not sure anybody really expected this. General Motors is set to announce it is paying back billions of dollars in government bailout money and doing it earlier than the original June deadline. The Detroit Free Press reports that GM's chief executive Ed Whitacre will announce tomorrow the company will pay nearly 5 billion that his company owes Washington and about a billion dollars that it owes the Canadian government. The emergency loans helped the automaker get through the financial crisis and bankruptcy. Now GM wants to lessen its financial dependence on the government. GM's reputation suffered when it went to the government for cash. Ford by contrast did not take bailout money and its brand got a boost.
