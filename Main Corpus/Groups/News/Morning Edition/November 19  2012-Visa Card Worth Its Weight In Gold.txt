 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne with a credit card that is worth its weight in gold. For those who want to buy bling with bling a bank in Kazakhstan plans to offer a Visa card made of gold plus a couple of dozen diamonds and mother of pearl. It will require 100000 upfront and an annual fee of 2000 but there are no late fees and you get a free iPhone. It will not be the first bejeweled card just the first made of pure gold. It is MORNING EDITION.
