 Good morning I am David Greene. Did you know the screen on your smartphone may have five times more germs than a toilet seat? That is according to the Japanese mobile company NIT which seems to be exploiting just how gross that is.

Then the toilet paper encourages you to log on to NIt is Wi-Fi network and to enjoy surfing. It is MORNING EDITION.
