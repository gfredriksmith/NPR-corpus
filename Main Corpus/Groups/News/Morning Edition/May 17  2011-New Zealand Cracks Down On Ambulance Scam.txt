 And today's last word in business is ambulance chasers. In New Zealand some cities have far more ambulances than they could possibly need. It is not because officials have devoted so many resources to emergency services it is because local drivers have been registering their cars as ambulances because they get to pay lower registration fees. Ambulances cost only about 45 per year to register while cars cost hundreds of dollars. In the Ottago region a newspaper reported that 230 ambulances have been registered even though a local official believes only 40 are genuine. Authorities say they are on to the scam. They are warning of big fines. We do not yet know if drivers might have to paint the word ambulance backwards on the front of their Toyota Corollas.
