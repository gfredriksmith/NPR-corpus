 Well it is a big month for hip-hop albums. Kanye West released Ye and Nas dropped Nasir.  Then on Saturday Beyonce and Jay-Z released Everything Is Love.    Stack my money fast and go.   Fast fast go.   Fast like my Lambo.  All right that is a clip from a song which has a name that we cannot say on the air but features a music video set at the Louvre Museum in Paris. Here's Rodney Carmichael from NPR Music.  To be in this gallery where blackness itself is very minimal at best represented in the artworks and for them to be front and center but for them to also be making blackness front and center - it is a really important message.  The album also focuses on the struggles of love.  They use this embattled marriage to talk about the real hard work of real love and real generation of wealth building.  Now this is not the first time the two have woven their marriage into music. They have been Crazy In Love proclaimed Love On Top and now Everything Is Love.    The ups and downs are worth it. Long way to go but we are working. We are flawed but we are still perfect for each other baby you. Sometimes I thought we would never see the light and went through hell with heaven on our side.
