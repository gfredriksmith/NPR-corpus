 Good morning. I am Noel King. Your parents ever get on your case about having kids? Imagine what it is like to be a Swinhoe turtle under the watchful eyes of scientists. They thought there was only one of these turtles left on Earth. He is in a zoo in China. But they found a female turtle in a lake in Vietnam last fall. They are going to introduce the turtle soon hoping the two will become more than friends and save the Swinhoe species. It is MORNING EDITION.
