 And next let us remember a man whose voice echoed beyond a campaign and throughout a presidency. Ted Sorensen died yesterday. He provided advice strategy and words for President John F. Kennedy. Sorensen played a big role in writing Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning book Profiles In Courage. He also crafted a letter to the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev that is credited with helping to end the Cuban Missile Crisis. Sorensen considered those words his greatest achievement. He is also associated with these words.  And so my fellow Americans ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country.  That is from Kennedy's inaugural address in 1961. Decades later our own Scott Simon asked the speechwriter who really wrote that famous line.  I would not remember now who provided one word or one line but John F. Kennedy was the author of his inaugural address because he is the man who made the decisions on what policies and values to enunciate.  It is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
