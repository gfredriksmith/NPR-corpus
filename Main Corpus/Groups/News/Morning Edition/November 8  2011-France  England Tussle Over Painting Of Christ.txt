 A 17th century painting is at the center of a tussle between France and England today. The painting features a life-sized study of Christ titled Christ Carrying the Cross. It was painted by the French Baroque artist Nicolas Tournier in the 1630s only to disappear from France in 1818. The huge canvas turned up in Italy a couple years ago. A gallery in London purchased it and brought it to a showing in Paris this past weekend. Now the French government is trying to keep the painting. France says the piece is stolen goods and is claiming it as state property. This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Renee Montagne.
