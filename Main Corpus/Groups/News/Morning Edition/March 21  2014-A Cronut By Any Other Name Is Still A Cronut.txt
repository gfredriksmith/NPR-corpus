 Good morning. I am Linda Wertheimer. Little Big's Bakery in South Portland Maine worked up its version of the cronut the croissant-donut hybrid. The Mainers tried to stand out spelling theirs C-R-A-U-X-nut. But the original New York baker sent a letter saying he has trademarked the cronut name no matter how you spell it. So Little Big's took another stab at it. Now they call their popular pastry C-and-Ds - standing for cease and desist. It is MORNING EDITION.
