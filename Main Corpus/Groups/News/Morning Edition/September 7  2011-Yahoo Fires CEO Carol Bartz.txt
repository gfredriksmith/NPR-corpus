 NPR's business news starts with a shakeup at Yahoo.   The CEO of the Internet search company has been abruptly fired. Yahoo's board of directors informed Carol Bartz of its decision yesterday while she was travelling. The board was apparently frustrated by her inability to turn the company around and generate more growth in the two and a half years she had been in charge.
