 And California has a new big bank which grew not out of success but out of failure. East West Bank just grew larger after acquiring a failed competitor United Commercial. Both banks cater to the Chinese-American community. From member station KPCC Brian Watt has more.  United Commercials 63 branches competed with East West Bank and Cathay General Bank for Chinese-American customers. Banking analyst Ken Thomas says East West gets a deal in taking over its chief competitor but he says Asian-American small businesses looking for loans lose a major choice. Mr.  Instead of going to say a bank in Chinatown whether in LA or New York and having the choice of three banks that focus on the Asian-American community theres now only going to be two.  United Commercial Bank failed in large part because of bad loans particularly in the commercial real estate market. The federal government tried to keep it alive last year with nearly 300 million in bailout funds. K.T. Leung is vice president of the Chinese American Chamber of Commerce of Los Angeles. He says Chinese-Americans are very selective when looking for a loan. Mr. K.T.  They always like to shop around try to shop for the best deal.  But Leung doesnt think United Commercials collapse will affect competition too much. He is concerned however that charities in local Asian communities will miss the support of an additional corporate sponsor. For NPR News Im Brian Watt in Los Angeles.
