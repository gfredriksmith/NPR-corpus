 Good morning. I am David Greene. Kristie Wolfe was working with the Idaho Potato Commission doing promotion events with a giant potato. When the 6-ton potato was retired Kristie wanted to give it a second life as an apartment. The Idaho Statesman reports she put it on her property and is renting it on Airbnb. It is nearly 12 feet tall 28 feet long with insulation a bed a walk-in shower. It will rent for 200 a night as long as no one eats it.
