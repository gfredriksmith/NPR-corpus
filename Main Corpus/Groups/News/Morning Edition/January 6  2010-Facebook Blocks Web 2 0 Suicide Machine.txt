 Now if you are motivated to stop social networking pay attention to our last word in business today antisocial media. A Netherlands-based computer group has designed a program that helps people to quickly sever all connections to services like Facebook MySpace Twitter and LinkedIn. It is called Web 2.0 Suicide Machine.  Something's so appealing about that. It does not just erase your account. It deletes all your friends and messages. Then it changes your username and password so you cannot ever log in again. It also changes your profile picture to a noose...    Facebook though is fighting back. It says the Dutch group is violating its policy.  It is policy that encourages more friendliness I guess. And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Steve Inskeep.  And I am Madeleine Brand.
