 NPR's business news begins with a call for action on China's currency.   Chinese President Hu Jintao will pay a state visit to Washington this week. Some Democratic senators plan to mark the occasion by introducing a measure that targets what they consider an undervalued Chinese currency. The relatively cheap Chinese currency makes its exports cheap and makes American exports comparatively expensive. The measure would impose penalties that include tariffs and would prevent Chinese companies from receiving U.S. government contracts.
