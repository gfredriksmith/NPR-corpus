 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Helen Smith was driving across Utah when she was pulled over for tailgating a state trooper. Let off with a warning Smith accidentally reversed into the trooper's front bumper. But when the 87-year-old told the trooper she was trying to reach her ailing son he organized a relay of other troopers to drive her the 180 miles to the hospital. She told KUTV she was grateful for the ride with quote four good-looking patrol boys. It is MORNING EDITION.
