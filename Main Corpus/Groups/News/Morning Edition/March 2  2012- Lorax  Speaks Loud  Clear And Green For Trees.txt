 In the early days of the environmental movement the children's author Theodore Geisel better known as Dr. Seuss wrote a book about saving trees. That 1971 book has now been made into a film opening today Dr. Seuss's The Lorax. Film Kenneth Turan has our review.  Movies always have monkeyed around with their source material but Dr. Seuss's The Lorax actually apologizes for what it is about to do. The fuzzy orange Lorax amiably voiced by Danny DeVito steps out in front of a theater curtain and announces There is more to this story than what is on the page. You have been warned. Let us start with 12-year-old Ted voiced by Zac Efron.   He is a miniature adult who uses breath freshener spray and has the wiseacre attitude of a Las Vegas lounge lizard. This irritating young man is infatuated with a girl named Audrey.   Fortunately real trees have disappeared from the town. The only person who seems to have a clue about them is Ted's grandmother voiced by Betty White.   Once the Once-ler is tracked down to a desolate area he is rightly suspicious of Ted's motives.   The Once-ler eventually describes how his own youthful greed put him into conflict with The Lorax who as every reader of the Dr. Seuss original knows speaks loud and clear for the trees. But to expand Seuss's slim volume to theatrical feature length a whole lot of plot and heaping handfuls of characters needed to be invented. These new individuals are for the part unpleasant and new the aspects of the story are forced.   By the time a cheerful song tries to rescue the film at the end the original Lorax has left the building and is not coming back.
