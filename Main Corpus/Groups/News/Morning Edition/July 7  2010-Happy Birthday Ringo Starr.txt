 Our last word in business today...    They say it is your birthday.  Former Beatle Ringo Starr turns 70 today. In his honor New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art has put Starr's gold-plated snare drum on display. The drum was a gift from the Ludwig Drum Company. The Ludwig logo was featured prominently on the drums Starr played during the band's 1964 debut on The Ed Sullivan Show.   Ladies and gentlemen the Beatles.    The Ludwig Drum Company could barely keep up with demand after that. Dick Schory was Ludwig's director of marketing at the time.  We normally had one shift a day. Then when the Beatles craze developed we added a second shift and then the third shift and did work on Saturdays and Sundays.  That is the business news on PR News. I am Mary Louise Kelly.  And I am Renee Montagne.
