 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Smoke alarms are a must in every household and if you are looking for a backup try a parent. Anton Nguyen of Brisbane Australia was awakened in the middle of the night when his parrot Eric started yelling. The parrot noticed the house was on fire even before the smoke alarm went off. That gave the owner and bird time to escape. Mr. Nguyen told Australian Broadcasting everything's all right so long as I have myself and the bird. It is MORNING EDITION.
