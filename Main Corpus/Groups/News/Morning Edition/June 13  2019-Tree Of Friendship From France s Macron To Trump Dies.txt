 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. We have been slow to report this story which sounded too satirical to be true. Days ago we heard a tree of friendship which France's president gave the U.S. and planted at the White House with President Trump is dead. Now it is confirmed. The tree was dug up and quarantined as agricultural imports are and did not survive. President Emmanuel Macron will send another saying quote the history of friendship between our peoples is well worth it.
