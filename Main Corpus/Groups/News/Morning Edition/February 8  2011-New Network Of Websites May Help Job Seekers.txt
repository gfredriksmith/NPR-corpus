 The government uses dot-gov for its websites. Schools use dot-edu. Now dot-jobs is the place you go to find work and it is a place where you will find 89000 employers. NPR's Nathan Rott reports.  Let us say you want a nursing job in Detroit there is a new way to find it online using a growing network of websites - all operating under an umbrella named universe.jobs. At a press conference in Washington Monday Bill Warren of universe.jobs explains.  Right from the browser a job seeker can put in Detroit.jobs or...  Or nursing dot-jobs. For either you would get a list one with nursing openings nationwide the other with a list of Detroit jobs. Warren says you are better off combining the two using something like Detroitnursing.jobs. That'ill give you a more streamline list of openings. By clicking on one you will be redirected to that employer's website where you can fill out an application. It is easy and more importantly it is free - both for the job- seeker and the company hiring. Other job sites like Monster.com and CareerBuilder charge for posting ads. And that limits the number of jobs companies can afford to advertise says Simon Evans an executive with one of the Fortune 1000 companies backing the non-profit site.  We do not post all our positions because frankly I cannot afford to. So imagine what that means for a small business?  With no cost he says more businesses will post more jobs. Already 780000 jobs are listed. Nathan Rott NPR News Washington.
