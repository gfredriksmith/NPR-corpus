 NPR's business news starts with GM's new two-wheel vehicle.   It could be a sign of radical innovation or perhaps drastic downsizing. Today the company that brought us the Hummer is unveiling a tiny electric vehicle - a two-wheeled two-seat battery-powered vehicle looks like wheelchair with a clear plastic canopy. It is designed to zip around congested city streets. GM developed the device along with Segway the company known for those odd electric stand-up scooters that you sometimes see on city streets. This new device can travel 35 miles on a single battery charge. It will not be rolling off an assembly line anytime soon but GM says the cost of the only one would be one third to one fourth the cost of a regular vehicle.
