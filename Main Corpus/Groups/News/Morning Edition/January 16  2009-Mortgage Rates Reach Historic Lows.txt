 NPR's business news starts with mortgage rates at an all-time low.   It is one of the few positive signs in this economy. The latest survey from mortgage giant Freddie Mac shows that mortgage rates have dropped for 11 straight weeks to a record low. NPR's Chris Arnold reports.  Hone mortgage rates have not been this low since Freddie Mac started tracking the data back in 1971. The weekly average rate for 30-year fixed-rates loans is 4.96 percent and that factors in that some people are paying so-called points to buy down the rate but many people get around five and a quarter without paying points. That is saving a lot of people hundreds of dollars a month on their house payments if they refinance right now. And rates might get even better. Dr. ALBERT PETE  I think there is a good chance that long-term fixed-rate mortgage rates could continue to fall and get into the mid fours or even low fours.  Pete Kyle is a finance professor at the University of Maryland. He says the government is taking steps that should drive rates lower and he says the extra spending money and the boost to the housing market will be a big help to the economy. Dr.  It is a great thing to the economy and I think it is the most powerful financial stimulus we have right now going on.  So Kyle says it might be time to take advantage of the situation and get your mortgage broker on the phone. Chris Arnold NPR News.
