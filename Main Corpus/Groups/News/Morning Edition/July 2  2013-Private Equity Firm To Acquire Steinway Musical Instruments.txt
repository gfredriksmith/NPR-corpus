 NPR's business news starts on a high note.   Steinway Musical Instruments announced Monday that it would be acquired by the private equity firm Kohlberg and Co. in a deal worth 438 million. Kohlberg says it plans to build on Steinway's 160 years of piano-making tradition and expand its sales globally. Steinway's stock price jumped in response to the news. And for the record the company's ticker symbol is LVB - a reference to the initials of Ludwig van Beethoven.
