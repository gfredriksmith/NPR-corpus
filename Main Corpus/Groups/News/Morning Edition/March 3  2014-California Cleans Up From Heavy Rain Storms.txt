 California is cleaning up after a powerful storm over the weekend. High winds and heavy rain caused mudslides and power outrages. As NPR's Nathan Rott reports it was not all bad news for the drought-stricken state.   Torrents turned to trickles Sunday and the rain that people in California have quite literally been praying for came to a stop. All told the downtown San Francisco received more than eight inches of rain. Downtown Los Angeles more than four. That is more rain than L.A. had seen in all of the last year and not all of it ran down drains like this. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works says that it captured 26 million gallons of storm water for local water supply over the weekend. And while that is great news for the bone-dry south David Sweet a meteorologist with the National Weather Service says it is still not enough.  Even though it was a very impressive storm with impressive rainfall totals we are still well behind this year.  Six inches behind in L.A. Sweet says and going forward...  We are looking at return to dry conditions and actually fairly warm temperatures.  So right back in it. Nathan Rott NPR News.
