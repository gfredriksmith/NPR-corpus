 Oprah Winfrey's cable channel OWN is on better footing.  It is a joint venture with Discovery Communications which reports that the struggling cable channel is now profitable two-and-a-half years after its launch. Here's more from NPR's Elizabeth Blair.  Discovery's chief executive says OWN is now cash-flow positive. In a conference call with analysts David Zaslav said that among women ages 25-54 OWN's viewership increased 39 percent in the second quarter.  The highest growth of any cable network in the second quarter.  Zaslav singled out two new shows that he said were bona fide hits both by director Tyler Perry The soap opera The Have and Have Nots...    Your husband and I have been having an affair.  ...and the sitcom Love Thy Neighbor.    But I am sure gonna need an umbrella by the time you get through spittin' on me.  Discovery Communications has invested some 300 million into OWN but it was a rough start. Winfrey was not around much in the beginning. Ratings were a disappointment. And there was turnover at the top. Things began to get better when Winfrey returned with the series Oprah's Next Chapter.  Guests have included Jamie Foxx Usher LeBron James and more recently Lance Armstrong. OWN is also getting higher subscriber fees. The improved performance means OWN can now pay down its outstanding obligation to Discovery.  As if we would expect anything less from the queen of talk. Elizabeth Blair NPR News.
