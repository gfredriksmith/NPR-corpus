 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. One of the most exciting finds at the glittering King Tut exhibit is a simple wooden chariot. Even 3000 years ago there was no gold leaf. The chariot's charm is it appears to have been driven by the young king. It did hit a bump on the road when it arrived in New York. When traffic officials discovered the truck carrying the chariot classified it as a vehicle they demanded a vehicle identification number. Problem solved though by the time it was unveiled yesterday. It is MORNING EDITION.
