 Good morning. I am David Greene. Police in Fort Worth Texas posted a screenshot with the hashtag whoyougonnacall . While chasing another vehicle they had spotted this SUV on the road with the Ghostbusters insignia. Turns out it was some paranormal experts from Dallas.

You are going to endanger our client the nice lady who paid us in advance before she became a dog.  It is MORNING EDITION.
