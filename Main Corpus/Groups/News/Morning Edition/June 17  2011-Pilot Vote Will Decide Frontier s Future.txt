 NPR's Jeff Brady explains.  Airline analyst Mike Boyd says Republic's strategy for Frontier is partly to blame.  They have an operation in Denver and they have an operation in Milwaukee and they are trying to fly flights out of Kansas City and out of Omaha and I think it is kind of frittered away their strength.  Boyd says Frontier's strength is its association with Denver and the brand loyalty the airline has with flyers here. Boyd says Frontier is still a well-run airline it just needs to return to its Mile High roots.  So with a little more capital there is no question they can survive.  Jeff Brady NPR News Denver.
