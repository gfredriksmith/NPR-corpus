 On this morning after some big presidential primaries we have results of another important vote.   Involving bald eagles. The National Arboretum in Washington D.C. Has two new eaglets.  Their parents did not get to name them though. America did by voting through a social media campaign. The two winning names are Freedom and Liberty.  Really? That does not really seem like common names that most people would come up with.  Well voters got to choose from a selection of names. Another pair of names was Honor and Glory.  I would have voted for Lourdes.  You know you can call me Lulu  Steve.  Oh so sweet thank you very much. Now on the occasion of this election we have been thinking about the political significance of a name. Mark Edmond of Verdant Labs in Seattle was researching baby names. He is a new dad. And he decided to look into the correlation between names and political affiliations.  For donors to Hillary Clinton you see Liz is one of the top names. And then for Bernie Sanders Carl. For Donald Trump you have Bobby. For Ted Cruz you have Billy. And for John Kasich you have Glenn.  As for the eaglets their names suggest their votes are up for grabs.  About 50 percent of people named Freedom though it is not a very common name they are Democrats. And about 50 percent are Republicans. And if you look at Liberty it is a bit more to the left with about 53 percent Democrats.  In other words these eagles may turn out to be swing voters.    I want to fly like an eagle to the sea.
