 Good morning. I am David Greene. Six people went to the hospital and dozens were evacuated from a German post office over the weekend all because of a package containing a smelly fruit. Durians clearly are not common in the Bavarian town of Schweinfurt which makes sense because they come from Southeast Asia. But do not worry - the four durians in this package did get to their intended recipient in Nuremberg and around 60 German postal workers apparently learned about a spiky pungent snack.
