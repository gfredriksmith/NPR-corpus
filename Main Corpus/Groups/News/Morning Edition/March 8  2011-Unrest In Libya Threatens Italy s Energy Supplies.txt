 This is PR News. I am Ari Shapiro.  And Sylvia what has Italy done so far to break relations with Libya?  Now today Italy feels it has the most to lose from the events in Libya and it does not like sanctions or a no-fly zone. Officially the government said its 2008 friendship treaty with Libya is de facto suspended. But it made clear that it does not now intend to freeze Libyan assets in Italian companies as Britain Germany France and Austria have done.  So are these economic ties between the two countries strong enough that they have seemed to have paralyzed Italy diplomatically?  Libya also owns shares of the Juventus soccer team the Fiat automaker and the ENI oil company. Italy is Libya's biggest trade partner and Libya is the fifth biggest investor in Italy. So when the uprising started the Italian stock market took a big hit. And those close economic ties were consolidated by this very controversial friendship treaty.  You mentioned the friendship treaty. What is that exactly?  The most controversial clause of the treaty states that Italy will not allow its bases including NATO bases on its territory to be used for any action against Libya.  And so does that mean that now that the treaty is suspended NATO could use bases in Italy if there were military operations against Libya?  So Italy has been sending really mixed signals. It does not have a clear idea what to do. But it is clear that given Libya's vast territorial expanse any Western military operation would require the use of the several U.S. and NATO bases in Italy including the facilities of the U.S. Sixth Fleet in Naples.  Sylvia thanks very much.  Thank you Renee.  That is NPR's Sylvia Poggioli in Rome.
