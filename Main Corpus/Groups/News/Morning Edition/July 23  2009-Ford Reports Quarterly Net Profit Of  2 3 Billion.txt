 NPR business news starts with good news from a carmaker.   And that news comes from an American carmaker the Ford Motor Company. Ford says it made 2.3 billion dollars in net profit in the last quarter. Most of the profit came from one time financial transactions not an explosion in car sales. If you do not count the financial gains Ford posted an operating loss of more than 600 million dollars but still that was better than many analysts had expected. And Ford's CEO Alan Mulally says the company is on track to break even in 2011.
