 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Arizona State Senate president Bob Burns found a perfect way to rain on Sunshine Week. That is an effort by journalists to promote transparent government and to warn about the dangers of secrecy. In the spirit of openness Mr. Burns used a Sunshine Week press conference to explain that reporters would no longer have a place to work at the State Capitol building. As of July 1st Republicans will be using that space as a meeting room. It is MORNING EDITION.
