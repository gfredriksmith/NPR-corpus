 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. COVID-19 left a blank space in Matthew Ables' summer schedule. The roller coaster aficionado was supposed to hit some theme parks and see a very special person in concert but 2020 had other plans for him. So he got creative.   I designed a Taylor Swift theme park.  Ables mocked up a full-color map of a Swiftie fantasyland from his wildest dreams. It includes 60 attractions based on T. Swift's most popular songs - truly the stuff of folklore. It is MORNING EDITION.
