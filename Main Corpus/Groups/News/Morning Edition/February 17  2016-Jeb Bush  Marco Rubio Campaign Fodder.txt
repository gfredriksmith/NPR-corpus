 Good morning. I am David Greene. This is a moment in the show when we have been covering the presidential campaigns' quirkier moments like when Hillary Clinton turned into a meteorologist and made snow predictions for Iowa. Well now this Jeb Bush's campaign did not protect the website jebbush.com. Apparently a Donald Trump supporter owns it now. You are quickly directed to Trump's site. And Marco Rubio's new morning in America ad has this gorgeous skyline. Vancouver Canada you have never looked better. It is MORNING EDITION.
