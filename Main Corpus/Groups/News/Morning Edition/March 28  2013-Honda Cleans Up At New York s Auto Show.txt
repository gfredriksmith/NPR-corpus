 At the New York Auto Show this week Honda is cleaning up. The carmaker has wowed people with its new Odyssey minivan because of the built-in vacuum cleaner.  Yeah the carmaker says it worked with Shop-Vac to design its HondaVAC which it tells is the first ever in-car vacuum cleaner. It is tucked inside the driver's side rear cargo space and it comes with all sorts of attachments.  And so our last word in business today is Why did it take a car company so long to do this?  Yeah. I mean this car vacuum cleaner really sucks. Sorry. That is the business news on MORNING EDITION. I am David Greene.  And I am Linda Wertheimer.
