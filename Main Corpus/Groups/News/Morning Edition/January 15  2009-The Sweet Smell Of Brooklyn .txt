 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Brooklyn has been hip for some years as writers and artists fled an increasingly pricey Manhattan. Now the borough has got a new scent. It is a perfume just launched called Brooklyn. It comes in a bottle covered in graffiti a whiff if you will of the old days. The perfume maker wanted to capture the young vibe of Brooklyn which apparently smells not of grungy subway trains but rather of grapefruit cedar and cypress. It is Morning Edition.
