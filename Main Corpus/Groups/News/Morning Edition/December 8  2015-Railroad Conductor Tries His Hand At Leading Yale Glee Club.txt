 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with the story of a glee club on a train. The Yale Glee Club was traveling on a commuter line out of New York. The train conductor tapped a handrail raised his arms and conducted them...    Hark how the bells sweet silver bells.  ...Because he is a conductor. Video captured the crowded train car filmed the song.    Ding dong ding dong one seems to hear words of good cheer from everywhere filling the air.  It is MORNING EDITION.
