We have expanded our Frequently Asked Questions page. It now has an easily searchable tool that you can use on your desktop tablet or Smartphone. Not seeing the answer you are looking for? You can plug in your own question.  And you will get an answer devised by our health team led by our own Julie Rovner. The website is NPR.orgaca. This is MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
