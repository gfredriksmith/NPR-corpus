 Good morning. Two turkeys doomed for dinner made a grand Thanksgiving escape. The crate the birds were in fell off a truck in Wisconsin and the duo made a break for it. The cops could not catch them. A flock of wildlife activists did capture the birds. Turns out they are a rare breed called Blue Slate turkeys so they will spend Thanksgiving and the rest of their lives at a bird sanctuary. So there is lots to be thankful for. It is MORNING EDITION.
