 In New York City there is a new structure taking shape high above Central Park.  Once we started to hoist the modules with an enormous crane people became aware of it. You can see if from great distances.  That is Anne Strauss an associate curator at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art. She is talking about a new exhibit in the Met's rooftop garden called Cloud City.  The piece stands 28 feet tall and it is composed of 16 many-sided pods. Think here about something looking like a space station or maybe an outcrop of gemstones that you can climb inside and explore.  You are walking through it. And you are seeing slices of the city turned upside down.  Some of the floors are transparent. The walls are mirrored steel or open to the air. It is like walking inside a kaleidoscope we are told a kaleidoscope that blends real views with mirror images of the sky and the city.  Tomas Saraceno is the Argentine artist who created Cloud City And he says the design was inspired by the foam in your drink.  When you drink milk with chocolate from a bottle or from a bottle of beer and then you see the geometry of the foam this is a little bit of the geometry of how we build the structure.  He says the principle here is to create structures that look light enough to float away.   That would be nice. That is what I want it to be. Maybe it is in the future.  Weighing in at 20 tons Cloud City is not likely to float off. But Saraceno says having it on the roof of the Met is a good place to start. The exhibit will be open until November and it is expected to draw more than a half a million visitors.
