 Good morning. I am Noel King. Cities around the world have held protests in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. In London they took a knee for nine minutes the time Officer Derek Chauvin had Floyd pinned down. In Berlin a mural of Floyd appeared on a remnant of the Berlin Wall. And New Zealanders ignored COVID restrictions to march. On the placards through the megaphones their message is universal - Black Lives Matter.
