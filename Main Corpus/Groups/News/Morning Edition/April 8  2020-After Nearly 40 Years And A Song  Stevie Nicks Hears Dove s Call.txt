  Good morning. I am Noel King. About 40 years ago Stevie Nicks wrote these lyrics in the song Edge Of Seventeen.    Just like a white-winged dove sings a song sounds like she is singing. Ooh ooh...  Nicks had read about the dove's call but she would never actually heard it. And then a few days ago she was at home and that bird's song came from right outside her window. I started to cry she wrote on Twitter. This dove had come here to watch over me.
