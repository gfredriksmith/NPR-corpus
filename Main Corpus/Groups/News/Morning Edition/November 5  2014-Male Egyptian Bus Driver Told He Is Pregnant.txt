 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with advice on how not to beat a drug test. An Egyptian bus driver was ordered to submit a urine sample. An Egyptian TV channel says he turned in his wife's urine instead. The upside was his wife's urine sample was clean. The downside became apparent when officials told the man he was pregnant - or rather his wife was. The man did not know. We have no indication if the driver will now move to Oregon or Washington D.C. which just voted to legalize pot. It is MORNING EDITION.
