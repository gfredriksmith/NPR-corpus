 J.R.R. Tolkien wrote The Hobbit before he wrote the Lord of the Rings series which of course became a huge success as a film trilogy. So no surprise that that director Peter Jackson has turned The Hobbit into a movie too. Actually he will be making another trilogy based on that single book. The first one opens at midnight tonight. Kenneth Turan has this review of The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey.  The story begins with the great wizard Gandalf announcing he is looking for someone to share an adventure.   Humble hobbit Bilbo Baggins wants no part of this. Adventures he says make you late for dinner. But before he knows what is happening thirteen rowdy dwarves show up at his house and create all kinds of havoc.   That dwarf bacchanal goes on and on and on. It is the first evidence of the unwise decision to turn this slender novel into three films that will likely have a running time of close to nine hours. There is just not enough story here to prevent things from getting pokey. Once Bilbo signs on to join the dwarf expedition much of what happens is a series of wearying battles that echo the Lord of the Rings carnage. And creepy Gollum returns as well.   But in this film without enough emotional material to balance the mayhem the violence gets increasingly exhausting as all those minutes unfold. The Hobbit is solid and acceptable not soaring and exceptional. Director Peter Jackson is touting a new 48-frames-per-second visual format as the best way to see The Hobbit but I have to disagree. Forty-eight frames is off-putting. It creates an image that plays more like high definition television than a rich cinematic experience. If you are enough of a traditionalist to appreciate this story you will want to see it the old-fashioned way.   The movie is The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey.
