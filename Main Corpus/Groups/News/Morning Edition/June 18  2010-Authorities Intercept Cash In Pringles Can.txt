 Let us go from Operation Stolen Dreams to what you might call Operation Potato Chip. One of the bizarre footnotes to the investigation involves what turned up in a can of Pringles.   Yeah that is the Pringles jingle. It comes up in this investigation because of a man named Garret Gilliland. He was an unlicensed mortgage broker suspected to have a role in 100 million mortgage fraud. Prosecutors had been watching him and that may be why they became suspicious when another man sent him a Pringles potato chip can. Authorities say they intercepted it and what they found inside was less crunchy than you might expect. Instead of potato chips they found 20000 in cash which is our last word in business today. A federal grand jury has indicted the sender for what is called bulk cash smuggling.
