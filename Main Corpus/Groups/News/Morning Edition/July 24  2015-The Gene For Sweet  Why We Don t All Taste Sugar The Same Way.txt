 We are also tracking this news. Apparently some of us are born with a taste for certain foods. To be more precise some people may have a gene that makes them more likely to enjoy sweet foods. Here's Eliza Barclay of NPR's food blog The Salt.  You would be hard-pressed to find a human being who cannot stand sweet treats. But we do not all crave sweetness.  If you go to Starbucks you can see some people are putting little or no sweetener in their coffee whereas other people are asking for a lot more sweetness.  That is Danielle Reed a scientist at the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia. She wanted to find out what determines our perception of how sweet something is.  We would think that how we are raised and sort of the shared family table might have a strong influence and we really did not see that.  Instead Reed and her colleagues found that about 30 percent of the variation seems to be in our DNA. They report their findings in the journal of Twin Research and Human Genetics.  Twins are just a really tantalizing and hard-to-resist natural experiment.  Since identical twins share almost all of their DNA twin studies are one way to try and tease out what preferences we might be born with versus the ones we learn from our environment. Reed says there might have been an evolutionary advantage for some of us to be more sensitive to sweetness.  Hunter-gatherers who are relying on plant food for nutrition might be more sensitive to sweet whereas humans that are eating predominantly meat might not have any sense of sweet at all.  Today Reed speculates there might be an advantage to being more sensitive to sugar. Those who are might need to eat less to get their fix. Eliza Barclay NPR News.
