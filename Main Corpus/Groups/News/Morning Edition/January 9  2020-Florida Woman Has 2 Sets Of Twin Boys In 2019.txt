 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. A woman in West Palm Beach Fla. got a big surprise. News channel WPTV reports that Alexzandria Wolliston had twins in March. Then in December it happened again - two sets of twin boys in 2019. She says they are a blessing from her grandmothers who both lost twins in childbirth.   I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids. They just sent them down for me.  She also has a 3-year-old who she says is like two kids in one.
