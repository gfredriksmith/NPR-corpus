 In NPR's business news we are tracking Europe's efforts to avoid recession.   If Europe's economy should slide further the European debt crisis would only get worse and it could be hard to contain the effects on the United States. So it is a somewhat hopeful sign that the strongest economy in Europe grew in 2011. A new report says Germany's economy grew by 3 percent. Not bad given all the European turmoil. The downside is the same report shows the German economy shrinking a bit at the very end of last year. And the wider European debt crisis is still far from being resolved.
