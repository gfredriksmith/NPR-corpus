 NPR's business news starts with Detroit cutting a deal.   After days of intense negotiations the city has reached tentative agreements with retired police officers and firefighters to preserve their pensions. Pensions of other city retirees would take a hit of 4.5 percent. They were facing a 26 percent cut. Thousands of active and retired workers will soon vote on the plan and it will be reviewed by a federal judge. The deal is part of a major effort by the city to emerge from bankruptcy by this fall. Last year citing a debt of 18 billion Detroit filed for the largest public bankruptcy in U.S. history.
