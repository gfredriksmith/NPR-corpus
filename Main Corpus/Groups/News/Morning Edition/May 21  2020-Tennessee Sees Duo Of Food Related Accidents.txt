 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. When a truck overturned near Nashville nobody was hurt but there was a tragedy. Forty thousand pounds of mac and cheese spilled from the trailer all over the road. Crews had to clean up the pasta fiasco which was actually the third course in a series of food-related accidents in Tennessee. Previous crashes damaged chicken and pumpkin pies. This mac and cheese crash however was the most serious carb wreck.
