 Today Chrysler is expected to announce plans to add more than 1000 jobs at an assembly plant in Ohio. Local officials there have reportedly signed off on tax incentives for the plant expansion in Toledo. It is where Chrysler makes the Jeep Liberty and Wrangler.  Auto companies have been doing more business this year than in past years. Volume for automakers may be going up but that is not the case for the postal service. Total mail volume continues its decline as more Americans shift to the Internet for bill paying and other communications. And the U.S. Postal Service is still deep in the red. Yesterday USPS executives announced 5.1 billion in losses in the last year. They say those losses could force them to run out of cash next year. The postmaster general is urging Congress to allow the mail service more flexibility in its finances and to close more branches and also to drop Saturday delivery.
