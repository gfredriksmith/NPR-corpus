 The states hit hard by unemployment include California which means more Californians are hearing this message.  Thank you for calling the Employment Development Department. We are currently receiving more calls than we can answer.  Frustrated by that digital voice some jobless here in Los Angeles are heading directly to the local Employment Development Office for information. As they waited in line yesterday a few of them shared their experiences.  I am Lindsey Browning. My profession is research administrator. I was terminated on the 31st of January - previous year. Three of my neighbors have been laid-off.  My name is Steven Rafael and I am here to get an extension on my unemployment. I mean I am living off credit cards. I mean it is just food and gas that is it. Stay at home and make it a Channel 13 whatever is free on TV.  My name is Eileen Moreno. I am a payroll specialist and I have been on a search since December. I mean you can go on Career Builder Monster or Craig's List and I have signed up with all the staffing agencies. You do not even get response back.  My name is Arad Deshad. I was security at the airport. I went back home for emergency Ethiopia Africa East Africa. And then when I came back they do not have any space. It is not like back home people do not help each other you know.  You are listening to MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
