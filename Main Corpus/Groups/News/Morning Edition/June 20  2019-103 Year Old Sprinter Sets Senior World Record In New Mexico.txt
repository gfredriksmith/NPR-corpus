 Good morning. I am Noel King. Her nickname is the Hurricane and it suits. Baton Rouge native Julia Hurricane Hawkins set a new world record in the 50-meter dash during a race in Albuquerque N.M. Her time - just a shade over 46 seconds. If you know anything about sprinting that might seem off. But Hawkins is 103 years old. She was competing in the Senior Games. Even more impressively Hurricane only started running two years ago when she was 101.
