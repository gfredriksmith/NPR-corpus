 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. A family in West Chester Pa. posted a video on social media. It shows two people stealing a lion statue from their front porch. According to CBS Philly the thieves ended up seeing the video online. Then a second video was recorded of the lion now returned to its rightful place with a bouquet of flowers and a note reading dear owner of lions we are greatly sorry for taking your lion. The family says no worries. And they have invited the thieves over for a beer summit. It is MORNING EDITION.
