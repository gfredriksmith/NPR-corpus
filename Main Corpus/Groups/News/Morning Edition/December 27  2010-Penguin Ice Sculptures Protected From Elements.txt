 Good morning. I am Renee Montagne. Heavy snow has brought out the heavy coats in the Northeast including warm wraps for a waddle of penguins made of ice. Each winter the ice sculptures are on display at the New England Aquarium. And to protect them from the threat of blizzard yesterday the aquarium wrapped them in tarps plus an extra layer of heavy plastic wrap. The aquarium's Tony Lactase told the Boston Herald the ice penguins are now buttoned up tight against the storm. It is MORNING EDITION.
