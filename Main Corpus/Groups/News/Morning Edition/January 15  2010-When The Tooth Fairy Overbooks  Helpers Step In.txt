 It is a Friday morning when we hear from our series StoryCorps. This project is traveling the country to record people talking about their lives and loved ones. Lisa Ray stepped into a recording booth in Norfolk Virginia because she wanted to share a particular memory of her father.  You know that story - I have held onto that all those years because my dad kind of messed up. It was my chance to see him as a human being and it made me really happy that I had that one solid memory. I think every kid needs to see their parents as a human being.   Lisa Ray in Norfolk Virginia. He interview will be archived along with all StoryCorps interviews at the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress. The podcast is at NPR.org.
