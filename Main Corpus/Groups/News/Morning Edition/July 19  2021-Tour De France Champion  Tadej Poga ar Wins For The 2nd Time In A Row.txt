 Tadej Pogacar has won the Tour de France twice now. For the second year in a row the 22 year old who is from Slovenia won the cycling competition. With the Arc de Triomphe in the background wearing the yellow jersey of the race leader Pogacar said he was pretty much winging it in his victory speech.   Last year I should write a speech for my first Tour de France victory. But I did not know how to write it. So also this year I said OK I am going to speak from the heart and just say what I have to say.  Last year's victory made Pogacar the Tour's youngest winner in 116 years. He was only 21 years old. Now he is the youngest rider ever to win the famous race twice.   I am just super happy and proud to be the - part of this team and of this journey. No I am not going to cry.  Not even a little.   I am super happy. Thank you everybody.
