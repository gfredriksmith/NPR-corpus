 Our last word in business today is yogurt. Actually yogurt and beer. Maybe not a combination you want to consider first thing in the morning - or maybe ever - but those two products will be together in this year's Super Bowl.  That is because Dannon Yogurt is making its advertising debut at the big game this year. Apparently it is the first time a commercial for yogurt will be featured during the big game. It may also be the healthiest food ever marketed at the Super Bowl. You can dip your Doritos in the yogurt. Dannon will air its spots alongside the ever-present ads for Bud Light beer as well as Doritos and Pepsi Cola - a couple of other Super Bowl regulars..  Companies are paying a record 3.5 million for 30-second spots this year. That is half a million more than last year. And NBC which airs the big game is all sold out of ad time. And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Linda Wertheimer.  And I am Steve Inskeep.
