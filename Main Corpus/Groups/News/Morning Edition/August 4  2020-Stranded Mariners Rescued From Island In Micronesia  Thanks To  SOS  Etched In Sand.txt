 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin here with the tale of a fateful trip. Three men in Micronesia went missing after their boat ran out of fuel. U.S. and Australian search crews were about to give up looking for them when a rescue helicopter turned to avoid some rain showers and then spotted SOS drawn into the sand of a small island. The men were rescued. Their original plan to sail 25 miles ended up taking them 120 miles off course - not exactly a three-hour tour. It is MORNING EDITION.
