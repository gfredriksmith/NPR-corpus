 Good morning. I am David Greene with a tool for sports fans to torment pro athletes. It is called Twitter. The NBA's New York Knicks lost to the Indiana Pacers Tuesday night falling further behind in their playoff series. Knicks shooting guard J.R. Smith took responsibility even though he has a cold. Fans? No sympathy.  A new Twitter account followed each shot he took. It is called Did J.R. Smith Miss? Yeah said one tweet. Sure did said the next. Another simply said I mean what do you think? It is MORNING EDITION.
