 And Soraya help us understand how this is all unfolding.  And so the tensions are rising even though the incident is now a few days ago.  Give us a little background here. Christians in Egypt - it is an old community. Who are they exactly and where are they concentrated?  And so they really are merged with the Muslims. They do not live separately. They are not a different ethnicity. They are just Egyptian Christians who never converted when Islam came to Egypt.  And Soraya have not Egyptian Christians long complained of discrimination?  For example that Christians are converting Muslims secretly and doing all sorts of things that sort of raise the ire or sensitivities on the Muslim sides and the government does not seem to do anything to stop that.  And how is the government responding to this? I know Egypt's president Hosni Mubarak came out rather quickly with a statement about this.  And this time the Christians say they will not put up with it.  Soraya thanks very much.  You are welcome Renee.  That is NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson speaking to us from Cairo.
