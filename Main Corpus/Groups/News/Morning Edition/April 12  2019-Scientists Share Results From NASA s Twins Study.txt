 OK. Have you ever wondered what happens physically to people when they are in outer space? Like what actually happens to their bodies? Scientists have shared results from NASA's twin study.  Yeah for nearly a year Scott Kelly lived at the International Space Station. Scientists compared samples from him and his earthbound twin brother Mark.  I talked with Scott Kelly back in 2017 and I asked him about his health.   You know the symptomatic stuff is fine. I do not have any long-term negative feelings physically from being in space. Now there is the things you cannot feel. And hopefully I will never learn that those are a problem.  Those things you cannot feel - well it turns out they are as small as the protective structures at the ends of his chromosomes.  Yeah. These are called telomeres and normally they get shorter with age. But what about in space?  What we wanted to do was evaluate telomere length in both of the twins before and after so that we could see you know where they started and then where they ended.  Susan Bailey was one of the scientists who answered this question. She expected the stresses of space to shorten telomeres quicker.  And in fact we saw exactly the opposite thing - that during spaceflight he had many more long telomeres than he did before he went up. So that really could not have been more of a surprise to us.  All right. Some other findings - Scott Kelly's gene expression changed and his immune system went into high alert. His flu shot worked despite all the stress of space. Back on Earth his body returned to normal within months.  Andrew Feinberg another scientist who led part of this study said this is a new chapter in tracking the effects of spaceflight.  I think that this study represents the dawn of the era of human genomics in space.  And the human body or at least Scott Kelly's seems pretty resilient.
