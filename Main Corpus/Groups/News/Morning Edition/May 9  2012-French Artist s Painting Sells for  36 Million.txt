 Good morning I am Steve Inskeep. Carefully note the technique of the late French artist Yves Klein. He made his project with water a blow torch and two models. The women pressed their wet figures against a fire-resistant board then stepped away. Afterward Klein torched the board an effect that left behind blurry silhouettes of models. This artwork called FC1 sold yesterday at Christie's in New York and the anonymous buyer paid more than 36 million. It is MORNING EDITION.
