 Good morning. I am Tonya Mosley. Georgia was not the only state to end a tight election last week. Dickinson a suburb outside of Houston had a runoff election for its next mayor. The race was between Sean Skipworth and Jennifer Lawrence. No not that Jennifer Lawrence. And the results ended in a tie. In accordance with Texas law the winner would be decided by drawing a name from a top hat - a literal top hat. And Mayor-elect Skipworth was the lucky winner. It is MORNING EDITION.
