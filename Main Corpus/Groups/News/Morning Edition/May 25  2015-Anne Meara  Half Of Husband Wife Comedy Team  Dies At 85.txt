 The actress and comedian Anne Meara has died at the age of 85. She became famous as one half of the comedy team Stiller and Meara. Here's NPR's Bob Mondello.  In their comedy routines husband and wife Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara generally played characters much like themselves - he short and Jewish she tall and Catholic.   It is really nice though you know how all our holidays come at the same time.  Oh yeah yeah.  I love that one you folks have around Christmas time. What do you call it? You know the one with all the candles - Chanukkah. That is beautiful.   Oh you mean Hanukkah?  Yeah Hanukkah.  No Hanukkah. The C-H is pronounced .  Oh I see. Well merry Christmas.   The team of Stiller and Meara became a national phenomenon in the 1960s in nightclubs on TV and in radio ads for Blue Nun Wine.   See I am having some friends over for smorgasbord - some shrimps a little cheese some meatballs. What kind of wine can you serve with all those things?  May I suggest you have a little Blue Nun at your smorgasbord?  Oh I do not think she would have a very good time. Besides it is going to be all couples.  Though they were hugely successful together from the start they also worked separately. Meara appeared in character parts in the movie Fame and the soap opera All My Children. She was nominated for four Emmy awards and won a Writers Guild Award as co-writer of the TV movie The Other Woman. Late in life she became a successful off-Broadway playwright and in the last few years she appeared with her husband in a series of web videos made by their son actor and director Ben Stiller.
