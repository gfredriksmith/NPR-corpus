 The mayor of Toronto says he will stay on the job. Rob Ford says that despite yesterday's remarkable confession prompted by video that is reported to show him smoking crack.  Yes I have smoked crack cocaine.   When sir?  Do I? Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it?  When have you smoked crack cocaine?  Probably in one of my drunken stupors probably approximately about a year ago.  The mayor did apologize. Many officials in Toronto seemed unimpressed with his statement that crack was only something he did while drunk. They have been urging him to seek help but Mayor Ford says he will not leave his job.  I was elected to do a job and that is exactly what I am going to continue doing.  The mayor is known for aggressive efforts to provide services to constituents but his record now includes that video currently in possession of the police. This is NPR News.
