 The PBS NewsHour has a new Web-only spinoff. It is called Everything But The News. It is the creation of former NewsHour producer Steve Goldbloom. The show takes a satirical look at the daily grind of a NewsHour field reporter. Think HBO's The Newsroom meets The Office.   Goldbloom told us about the day he pitched his idea for the show to his old boss NewsHour executive producer Linda Winslow.  I said I have got this idea. I really want to make fun of the NewsHour. But I think I could do it in a loving way in a way that my reverence would veer into the absurdity. And she said that is great. If it is good we will be - you know very supportive. If it is terrible it will be like it never happened we never knew you.   Sounds fair. The first episode went online in February. Goldbloom plays the main character a NewsHour tech reporter who just happens to be named Steve Goldbloom. The reporter's cameraman-sidekick is Goldbloom's real-life cameraman Noah Pink.   Each episode of this show follows these two as they go out to try and cover the tech scene for the NewsHour. Here Goldbloom visits a convention of YouTube's most popular stars.   Goldbloom's character learns that Dan Is Not On Fire's YouTube channel is burning it up when it comes to views. He asks Dan Howell - the Dan in question here - about the size of his viewership.    All joking aside numbers like that are really compelling. The PBS NewsHour draws about a million viewers to its broadcast each night. That is fewer than half the number that watched a decade ago. With his show Goldbloom and PBS are chasing new and younger viewers where they know they will find them Web-based video.  Shows like Everything But The News if we can generate a click for that show that is somewhat a nontraditional viewer of PBS that was our goal all along.  Steve Goldbloom in character on the show offers some thoughts on format changes that might help NewsHour attract those YouTube viewers.   Goldbloom and his cameraman Pink have 10 episodes of Everything But the News up online. This week you will find them in Austin Texas at the South by Southwest Festival.
