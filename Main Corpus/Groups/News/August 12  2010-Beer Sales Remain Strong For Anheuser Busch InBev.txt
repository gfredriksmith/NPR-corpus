 Well the economy may be at risk of slowing down again but as always the picture is uneven. And today's last word in business is devoted to one product that is selling well beer. Beer sales remain strong. Brewing giant Anheuser-Busch InBev announced its quarterly results this morning. Profits are up more than 7 percent. The company made over a billion dollars. The company said favorable weather helped to drive sales -favorable is how the beer company describes hot and muggy conditions. And soccer's World Cup also left consumers with an unquenchable thirst.   Dont worry that is not a hangover that is making your head ring its just a vuvuzela.
