  This past week composer Andrew Lloyd Webber hit a milestone.   Lord Lloyd-Webber now has four musicals running simultaneously on Broadway. The revival of Sunset Boulevard opened to rave reviews this past Friday night. The four are Sunset Boulevard School Of Rock Phantom Of The Opera and of course the ubiquitous Cats.    Jellicle cats come out tonight. Jellicle cats come one come all. The jellicle moon is shining bright.  Hold on. Hold on. We do not want to get that stuck in your head this early in the morning. That said this is a rare distinction that has not happened since the summer of 1953 when Rodgers and Hammerstein had their own Broadway takeover. Webber told The Telegraph I think back to when I first came to New York when I was 22. I met Richard Rodgers and he was my idol. He said I never would have dreamt this would happen. You know what? I actually really do love Cats. Hit it.    Midnight - not a sound from the pavement.  And if Cats is not really your speed tomorrow on Morning Edition Mandalit del Barco will recap the Grammy Awards the show is big moments and who wins the face-off between Adele and Beyonce for album of the year.    In the lamplight the withered leaves collect at my feet. And the wind begins to moan.
