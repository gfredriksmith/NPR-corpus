 Last year some 28 million cars were sold in China making it the world's largest automobile marketplace. But the top reason Chinese car buyers point to for rejecting a potential new car - how it smells. They do not want their cars to have that beloved new car smell. So Ford is hiring eight-team smell testers for their Chinese research labs. Their job is to stick their noses on floor mats carpeting seats the steering wheel - all of it - to help eliminate what for many Americans is the smell of freedom and the open road. While we conducted a very unscientific Twitter poll asking where you stand on this issue more than 1400 of you responded. Thank you for that. As of Friday you overwhelmingly loved the aroma of a new car. So it looks like there will not be any job smelling car parts in the U.S. just yet.
