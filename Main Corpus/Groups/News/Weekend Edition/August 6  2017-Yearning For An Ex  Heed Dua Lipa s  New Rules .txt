   One.  Heartbreak has been a source of musical inspiration pretty much since there is been music. This summer singer-songwriter Dua Lipa takes her crack at the theme with her tune New Rules. In the all-female New Rules music video the singer and her friends share some lessons about how to get over a broken heart.  There are three rules which I would have liked to tell myself after a breakup.    One do not pick up the phone. You know he is only calling 'ecause he is drunk and alone. Two do not let him in. You will have to kick him out again. Three do not be his friend. You know you are going to wake up in his bed in the morning. And if you are under him you as not getting over him. They are not necessarily rules that I have been able to stick by. But they are kind of rules that I feel like it is important to be able to tell yourself and to be able to tell your friends in kind of not going back to your ex because it could be - you know there is a reason people break up. And it is probably the same reason why you should not get back together.    I keep pushing forwards but he keeps pulling me backwards. Nowhere to turn - no way. Nowhere to turn. What I wanted to convey in this video is the unity and the togetherness of you know women supporting each other and helping each other and looking after each other in this situation - you know just kind of being together in a sleepover and talking about certain things that are kind of going wrong in a relationship and your friends being able to help you out. Helping you overcome those things - I feel like my friends and my family.    I got new rules. I count them. I think the most important thing is to be yourself. Everyone is so special in their own way. And someone is going to fall in love with them just the way they are. And they should not change a single thing about it.    I have got to tell them to myself.  That is New Rules by Dua Lipa.
