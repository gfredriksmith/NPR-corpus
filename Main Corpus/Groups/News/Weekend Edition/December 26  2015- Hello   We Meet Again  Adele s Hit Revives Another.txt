 Adele's smash hit Hello broke all kinds of records when it was released in November.    Hello it is me.  But no matter how much Adele has dominated the pop world in the last two months Hello does not just belong to her.    Hello is it me you are looking for? I can see it in your eyes.  Lionel Richie's '80s hit came first and it is making a bit of a comeback. Daily views of Richie's version have doubled since Adele's release and he has been vying for a collaboration with her. So as we say goodbye to 2015 maybe it is time to remember hello too.    And you know just what to do. And I want to tell you so much I love you.
