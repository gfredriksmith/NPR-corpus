 Before Bela Lugosi was Count Dracula the German director F. W. Murnau created his own bloodsucking fiend - a kind of tribute band Dracula that he called Count Orlok - in his 1922 silent film Nosferatu A Symphony Of Horror. Well it was a lot less expensive than paying for the rights to film Bram Stoker's Dracula. Murnau gave his hemoglobin-gobbling villain a bald skeletal skull long fingernails like eagles' talons. F. W. Murnau eventually moved to Hollywood. He made some films but died in a car accident in 1931. He was buried back in German and over the years his tomb has become a kind of tourist spot for Satanists. This week F. W. Murnau's skull was taken from his iron-clad coffin in the Stahnsdorf Cemetery near Berlin. Police are looking for witnesses. They may have to wait until after sunset.
