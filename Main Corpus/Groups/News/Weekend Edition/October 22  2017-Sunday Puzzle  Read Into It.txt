And Will why do not you remind us of the two-week challenge that folks should be working on.  Yes. It comes from Zack Guido who is the author of the book Of Course The Greatest Collection Of Riddles And Brainteasers For Expanding Your Mind. Write down the equation 65 - 43  21. You will notice that this is not quite correct. Sixty-five - 43  22 not 21. The object is to move exactly two of the digits to create a correct equation. There is no trick in the wording. And in the answer the minus and equal signs do not move. So again the equation is 65 - 43  21. Move exactly two of the the digits to create a correct equation. Can you do it?  Well when you have the answer go to our website npr.orgpuzzle and click on the Submit Your Answer link. Just one entry per person please. You have got one week left to submit. Entries are due this Thursday October 26 at 3 p.m. ET. Include a phone number where we can reach you at about that time. If you are the winner we will give you a call. And you will get to play on the air with the puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzle master Will Shortz. Will thanks so much.  Thanks a lot Melissa.
