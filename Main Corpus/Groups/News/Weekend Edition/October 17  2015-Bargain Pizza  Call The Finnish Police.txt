 So I was working a day shift in Helsinki when I got a call about a guy trying to sell a pepperoni pie for just a fiver. Police in Finland are asking people to call the cops if they find somebody trying to sell pizza for under six euros or about 6.81 U.S. currency. What do you tell the police? Officers come quick. I have just seen a man ring up a mozzarella and garlic for just 5.50. ULA Finland's national broadcast network quotes police officials as saying there is no way a legitimate establishment can offer pizza for less than six euros. Police are concerned that any pizza vendor who offers a bargain rate pizza might somehow be evading Finnish taxes which a Finnish government website says are 14 percent for quote foodstuffs restaurant and catering services and animal feed meaning I suppose that not even cows in Finland can get a pizza for under six euro.
