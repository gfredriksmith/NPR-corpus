 If you really want to feel Chuck Berry's impact on music just look to the stars - the rock stars who are remembering him. Bruce Springsteen called him the greatest pure rock and roll writer who ever lived. Keith Richards said one of my big lights has gone out. And Quest Love declared thou shall have no other rock gods before him.    Roll over Beethoven. I have got to hear it again today. You know my temperature rising and the jukebox blowing a fuse. My heart beating rhythm and my soul keep on singing the blues. Roll over Beethoven.
