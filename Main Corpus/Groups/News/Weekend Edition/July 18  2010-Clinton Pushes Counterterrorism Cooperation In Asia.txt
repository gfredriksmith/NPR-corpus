 NPR's Jackie Northam is traveling with the secretary and she joins us from Islamabad. And Jackie do you have a sense of Mrs. Clinton's agenda what she actually hopes to achieve during her two-day visit?  The idea is these projects will build a closer relationship with Pakistan which in turn it is hoped that will bring more cooperation and help on the counterterrorism front which the U.S. really needs from Pakistan.  And that is the other key issue Secretary Clinton will discuss during her visit. Will she sit down with military and political leaders to discuss just the extent of their help in rooting out those militants from the lawless regions on the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan?  So again some very serious conversations in the next couple of days.  Then the secretary of state is due to head to Afghanistan for a large international donor conference. What is going to happen there? What do you expect?  Karzai's also expected to ask donors for more control of the funding that is being pumped into Afghanistan - and that about 13 billion by the way. And you know donors balked at earlier conferences over this issue. They say always say we want to see more progress on fighting corruption but it is due to come up again.  And then Mrs. Clinton flies to Asia. Where is she going? What is she planning to do?  And then Liane her final stop is in Hanoi where she will attend a conference of Southeast Asian nations. So many many countries on this trip and most of them though touching on matters of national security for the U.S.  NPR's Jackie Northam is traveling with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She is in Islamabad. Thank you very much Jackie.  Thank you Liane.
