  You are hearing Min Xiao-Fen one of the world's greatest virtuosos playing the pipa. It is a pear-shaped guitar-like instrument from China with a history that goes back thousands of years. Min's inventive playing has sparked collaborations with New York jazz players and pop stars such as Bjork. Her new album White Lotus is an original soundtrack she wrote for The Goddess a classic 1934 silent film from the Golden Age of Chinese cinema.   Min Xiao-Fen plays with guitarist Rez Abbasi on White Lotus and they join us from Asheville N.C. Welcome.  Thank you for having us.  Thank you Leila.  So the movie tells this tragic story of a prostitute who desperately tries to shield her son give him a good education. She is robbed by a gangster ends up in prison for killing him. But a kindly school principal promises to raise him. And the film ends on this hopeful note for her son's future. Why did you decide to create a soundtrack for this film Min?  You know I always interested around the middle of the 1970s the Shanghai so-called Golden Age - music arts film - just so colorful. Also I like this film because it has a strong influenced-by-Hollywood style. The story itself - the mother tried to save her money to support her child and send her young son to get education. And she has such a big heart.  You know there is some beautiful interplay between the pipa and guitar. Let us listen to the second track called Seed.   Rez Abbasi when did you first start working with Min? And were you surprised that the pipa and the guitar would make such a good combination?  Well we - yeah we met a few years ago. And you know I always love plucked stringed instruments.  Yeah.  So when she asked me to do this I had no reservations. And in the piece that you heard there you know that is a little bit more chilled. But there are other areas in the film or in the score that we really rev it up and play very rhythmically and texturally.   And there is that scene where the principal comes to visit the mother and son. And we both dig into kind of the blues or fully the blues...  Yeah.  ...Into that scene. And so it is like a blue pipa.   It is like a - a little bit like the swamp kind of idea so behind it because you know Chinese has a blues too.  Yes.  You know so we always use pentatonic scale and the use of 44Bs . And so that is why I feel this American style for blues swamp and the perfect match with the Chinese blues.  Yeah. I mean Chinese opera's drenched in the blues actually.   You know I am going to step away from this album for a second and go back a little bit Min. You came to the U.S. in 1992 eventually met avant-garde composer John Zorn who encouraged you to improvise and explore jazz. And you became interested in the music of this guy.   Thelonious Monk. And this is how you interpreted his music on your pipa.   Thelonious Monk - you know I feel he is of course America's most influential jazz pianist and composer you know?  Yeah.  So angular. And the melody was you know dissonance. So I felt he influenced me to really find my instruments.  And you found that the pipa works well for jazz.  Well it take me years actually. It really probably take me 10 years. I am finally comfortable to play free improvisation. And of course because also I work with many many downtown jazz musicians in New York so I think of myself as a downtown musician avant-garde musician now.   .  Earlier this week you performed White Lotus there in Asheville along with the film. It can be seen on YouTube. So Rez and Min how did it go? What was the reaction?  Wonderful wonderful experience.  Yeah.  Yeah. So we have a...  Beautiful.  ...Lot of audience. And everyone seemed to really appreciate it too. Everybody say play more play. And...  Wow.  Yeah after show we just talked to the audience like - almost like hours right? Everybody do not want to leave. They just talk about - they said never see this kind of event and that they are so happy we were there.  Yeah and after the pandemic after not playing for a while.  Right.  Yeah.  It is interesting to play for a film because I realized just the other night how the notes take on a life of their own via the film. You know they are same notes that I play all the time on my couch or in everybody's bands and stuff but here we have this film leading us the whole way moment by moment. And we are mirroring it all the time.  Yeah.  It is like the same notes are no longer the same notes. It is very magical actually.   You know with this film particularly the subject matter to me is - you know it is essentially a microcosm of gender inequality and you know how women's rights have been severely undermined throughout history. So that allows this opportunity for us to delve into you know a range of creativity and a range of feelings. And it is very different than playing music for music's sake. I mean this is really almost a novel experience every time you do it.   Min Xiao-Fen - her album White Lotus featuring guitarist Rez Abbasi is out now. Thank you both.  Thank you.  Thank you Leila.
