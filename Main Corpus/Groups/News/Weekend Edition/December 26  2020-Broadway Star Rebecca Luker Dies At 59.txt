 Broadway star Rebecca Luker died this week at a Manhattan hospital from ALS also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. She was 59. Luker was best known for playing several roles in Broadway musicals from The Phantom Of The Opera to The Music Man. Jeff Lunden has this appreciation.  For over 30 years Rebecca Luker graced Broadway stages.    Come to my garden.  Rebecca Luker had a glow in her presence and in her voice that I associate with the golden age of musical theater.  Ben Brantley former drama critic of The New York Times was a big fan.  It was not that she was a throwback exactly. There is nothing quaint about her. But she had that kind of luminous soprano that you associate from another time.  The Alabama-born soprano played a variety of ingenue roles in both new shows and revivals Magnolia in Show Boat...    We could make believe.  ...Maria in The Sound Of Music.    The hills are alive with the sound of music.  And she told Broadway.com her very favorite Marian the librarian in The Music Man.   That show has been very special in my life since college. I was 19. It was just a wonderful experience you know all the way around.    Goodnight my someone. Goodnight my love.  As she got older Luker gracefully transitioned into roles like the mother Mrs. Banks in Mary Poppins and performed in cabaret and concerts she told WHYY's Fresh Air in 2005.   My voice has just gotten richer I think over the years - deeper and richer and more versatile I think.    I loved the man. Truly I did.  In February of 2020 she announced her ALS diagnosis and a month later both she and her husband actor Danny Burstein came down with COVID-19. Though Luker was wheelchair-bound and had trouble breathing she performed in an online fundraiser for ALS research in June.    There is a certain someone and I am anxious he should hear me.  She still had that luminous beautiful voice. For NPR News I am Jeff Lunden in New York.    Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe.
