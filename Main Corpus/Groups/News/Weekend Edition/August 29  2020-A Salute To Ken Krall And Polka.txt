 Thanks and salute this week to our friend Ken Krall who is been a longtime most everything from news director to host to operations manager at WXPR in Rhinelander Wis. Ken's retiring from his daily duties but he will continue to be a Saturday morning voice following our show every week with his signature polka program.   .
