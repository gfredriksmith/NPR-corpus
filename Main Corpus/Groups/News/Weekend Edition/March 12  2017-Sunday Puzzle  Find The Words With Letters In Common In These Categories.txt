 Well I am back from my trip to the border. And speaking of borders let us cross over to our next segment. It is time to play The Puzzle.   Joining me as always is Will Shortz. He is the puzzle editor of The New York Times and WEEKEND EDITION's puzzlemaster. Good morning Will.  Good morning Lulu. Welcome back.  Thank you. Good to be back. Remind us of last week's challenge.  Yeah. I said write the name of the game in lower case letters reverse the second and third letters turn the fourth letter upside down and the result will name something else to play. When I said upside down I meant rotate 180 degrees. That to me is what upside down is. And the answer is craps to cards.  We received over 600 responses and the winner is Miranda Beckmann of Brewster N.Y. Hey Miranda.  Hi there. How are you?  So I am great. I hear winning The Puzzle was on your bucket list.  It is. I am so stinking excited. I can barely contain myself.  I love that - stinking excited. I am going to use that now all the time. How did you figure it out?  My boyfriend and I were listening on the internet. We were sitting on the couch and it was actually the first thing that came to us for except for we came up with cards first and then reversed it to craps.  What do you do in Brewster?  I am a guide dog instructor and I work for a not-for-profit organization that breeds raises and trains guide dogs for people who are blind or visually impaired. And I supervise the residential training program.  That is amazing. All right. I understand you also have a question for Will.  I do. I do. Will are you a dog person? And if so what type of dog do you most enjoy spending your time with?  Wow. Yes I am a dog person and not a cat person definitely a dog person.  I see you take a strong stand on that.  Yes.
