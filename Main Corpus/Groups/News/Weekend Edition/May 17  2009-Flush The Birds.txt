 From NPR News this is WEEKEND EDITION. I am Liane Hansen. And joining us is puzzlemaster Will Shortz. Hey Will.  Hi Liane.  What is new?  I cannot think of anything.  Yeah.  Things are good here. How about you?  I got nothing.   Okay.  We have an interesting person who will be reading the puzzle prizes today. That is about all I can say right now. But we will save it until after the game is over.  Okay.  And to begin remind of the challenge you gave us last week.  Yes. It was a tough one. It came from listener David Hill of New York City. I said take these equations 5  4 7  17 9  25 and 35  2. And I asked what does 14 equal?  Even with a clue I did not have a clue. What was the answer?  Well the answer is 32. It had nothing to do with math and had all to do with presidents. The fifth president was named James Monroe and the fourth was James Madison so they share first names James. The seventh and 17th presidents were both Andrew Jackson and Johnson. Ninth and 25th were both William Henry Harrison and McKinley. And 35th and second were both Johns Kennedy and Adams. So the 14th president was Franklin Pierce shares a first name with the 32nd president Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  And I swore it was one of those math SAT problems to solve.   Well it was really tough. I mean really tough. So tough we only received about 200 correct entries this week. And from those entries we randomly selected Charlie Carroll of St. Paul Minnesota to play on the air with us today. Hi Charlie. Mr.  Hello Liane.  How did you solve this? Mr.  Well this one took a long time. And I might have given up except on Tuesday or so my brother sent me an email gloating that he had it. So I knew I had to .  Mr.  Eventually he did give me one small hint - that it had nothing to do with a dead end I was going down. But...  The math end right? Mr.  I was trying to - playing off two weeks ago - spelling out the numbers and it did not happen.  Oh oh oh. Mr.  But I think he got help from his 14-year-old son Matthew.  Hey. It is... Mr.  So it took a lot of the Carroll family to get it but we eventually did.  Oh that is nice you know the family that does puzzles together you know good deal.   How long have you been playing our puzzle? Mr.  Well somewhere between the first-timers you get every once in a while and the postcard people - a few years.  Oh a few years and have you been sending in entries all that time? Mr.  When I get them yes.  You are a puzzle person? Mr.  I am. I love puzzles.  Yeah I read here you used to compete in Scrabble tournaments. Mr.  I did. Back in the dinosaur age I played a lot of tournament Scrabble.   Cool. Well it sounds like you will be great at our puzzle. You ready? Mr.  Go for it.  All right. Will meet Charlie. Let us play.  All right Charlie I am going to read you some sentences. In each sentence change one letter in each of two words to name birds. For example is actor Dennis Quaid afraid of the dark? You would change the D in Quaid to an L to make quail and the D in dark to an L to make lark. And note it is always the same letter of the alphabet that is changed twice in each sentence. And the letter you change to is also the same.  Oh okay.  So it is D's in Quaid and dark you change and L's in the result quail and lark. All right here's number one. At Lake Huron turn left. Mr.  That one must be heron and...  Yes. Mr.  Oh and tern.  Heron and tern. Excellent. Number two Israel's Yitzhak Rabin exhibited great candor. Mr.  Robin and condor.  Oh good. Tell me when you have had enough chow. Tell me when you have had enough chow. Mr.  Tell me when you have had enough chow. So it seems like chow is the word that does not belong.  Right. Mr.  Oh crow.  Yes. And find another H and change that to an R. Mr.  Tell me. Oh wren.  Wren.  Wren is good. The toner cartridge ran out of ink before I could print Bugs Bunny's carrot. Mr.  Parrot and partridge.  Parrot and partridge. Good.   The water is lapping at the river's shore under the bridge span. Mr.  Is a lapwing a bird?  The lapwing is indeed a bird. Mr.  So I am sorry could you read the sentence again? We will look for the Ps.  Right. The water is lapping at the river's shore under the bridge span.  Oh. Mr.  Swan.  Swan is it.  Good job.  This bill for malt bitters is busting the budget. Mr.  Bittern.  Yes. Mr.  This bill for malt...  ...bitters is busting the budget. Mr.  Bunting? I think it must be bunting.  Bunting is it. That is it. A demand for higher wages was the thrust of the labor strike. Mr.  Thrush.  Yes. Thrust of the labor strike. Mr.  Oh shrike.  Shrike is it. Canoeists know not to shift their weight in shallow water. Mr.  Swallow...  Swallow is it. Canoeists not - know not to shift their weight. Mr.  Swift. Yup.  And swift is it. The restaurant manager gave the couple a free meal. Mr.  Tanager and teal.  Tanager and teal good. And here's your last one. Kate Winslet files her nails with sandpaper.  Mr.  Of course she does do not we all?  Mr.  Sandpiper and kite.  Good job Charlie that was great.  Charlie you know your birds. Oh well done. I have to admit I got way lost in this. I was lost in the bushes I think.   Or in the weeds as they say. Nice job. Well coming up we are going to hear the story of a 15-year-old girl who is heading to the Cannes Film Festival to show her documentary which is pretty exciting. This is Michele Pinczuk. Ms.  For playing our puzzle today you will get a WEEKEND EDITION lapel pin the 11th Edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and Thesaurus the Scrabble Deluxe Edition from Parker Brothers the Puzzlemaster Presents from Random House Volume 2.

Fifteen-year-old Michele Pinczuk. Is not that amazing a 15-year-old is getting her film shown at Cannes? Oh yeah. What do you think Charlie? Mr.  Well I was out of town recently and I saw KenKen puzzles for the first time. So - in the local newspaper in Pittsburgh - so I am real interested to get all this good stuff.  Excellent. And before we let you go Charlie you have to tell us the member station you listen to. Mr.  KNOW St. Paul Minnesota.  All right Charlie Carroll of St. Paul Minnesota. You were amazing. Thanks for playing the puzzle with us today. I am so glad you were there. Mr.  It was a pleasure.  Okay. Will we need a challenge for next week.  Yes. Think of a six-letter word in which the third letter is S as in Sam. Remove the S and you will be left with a five-letter word that means the opposite of the six-letter one. What is it? And here's a hint the six-letter word has two syllables the five-letter one has one. So again think of a six-letter word in which the third letter is S remove the S and you will be left with a five-letter word that has the opposite meaning. What words are these?
