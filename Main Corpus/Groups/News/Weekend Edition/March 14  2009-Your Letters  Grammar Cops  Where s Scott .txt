 Time now for your letters. We had a letter about last week's letters. I confessed to a grammatical mistake because I had said Dan and I rather than Dan and me. We got lots of notes complaining about my mistake. But this week Ben Cooper of Minneapolis says I should have stood my ground. There are two kinds of grammarians prescriptive and descriptive he writes. The prescriptive kind mostly rank amateurs like me try to tell people how they ought to use the language. The descriptive kind confine themselves to describing and systematizing how folks actually speak. For many years now a large number of Americans have been using the subject I in compound objects just as you used it. There is little doubt that the origin of this usage lies in the nearly universal memory of being chastised for saying him and me were just playing. Take that America. On last week's story on the company in Tasmania that makes writing paper from scats - and I do not mean singing - of various Australian creatures from kangaroos to wombats Joe Edgel of Takoma Park Maryland writes I was rolling on the floor and I might even buy their paper. Oh but do not expect me to get it anywhere near my mouth. Betty Dorko from Albuquerque  I have been running my mouth recently. She writes Whatever happened to Scott Simon's essay right after Daniel Schorr's commentary? I really miss that. Thanks for asking. In recent weeks we have moved it to the first hour around the same time where I made another error last week. I characterized Mahatma Gandhi as a Cambridge-educated lawyer. In fact he studied law at University College London. Send us your comments by e-mail our Web site NPR.org and click on Contact Us. Or you can reach me at NPRScottSimon on Twitter.
