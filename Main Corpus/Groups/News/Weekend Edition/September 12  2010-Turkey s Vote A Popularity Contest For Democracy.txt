 NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from a polling center in Istanbul. And Peter how has the voting gone today?  Most people say well yes we have got an old constitution the result of a military coup it does need to be rewritten. In fact the Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan was re-elected to do just that three years ago. But he could not get it through the parliament which is very divided. And so now what Turks are voting on today is this rather ad hoc package of 26 amendments.  And explain about those amendments. Why are some of them so controversial?  Opposition leaders say some of these reforms would give the AK Party too much power over the judiciary for instance. And they really do not believe Prime Minister Erdogan when he says he may be religious himself but his job is to defend Turkey's secular government. They are afraid that as the government gains more control it may seek to eventually undermine secular institutions.  So do Turks see this then as an early test of strength for the government which will seek its third term in office next year?  So this is definitely an important signal as to whether voters are still happy with the AK Party after eight years in power or whether they are beginning to think about a change.
