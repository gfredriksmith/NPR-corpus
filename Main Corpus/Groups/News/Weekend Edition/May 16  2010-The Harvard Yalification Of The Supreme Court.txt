Author Nicholas Lemann says the Harvard-Yalification of the court marks a resurgent elitism in American society.  It really represents an unstated but quite powerful consensus that there is a narrow channel through which you have to pass to be a Supreme Court justice.  Lemann says that the Kagan nomination points to a growing lack of diversity when it comes to background and experience. He says this cautious strategy dictates  If they have not done certain things by the time they are 25 or 30 game over.  Others look at the Harvard-Yale nexus and say So what? Professor Pamela Karlan of Stanford Law says your education resume just is not that important in the final analysis.

Elena Kagan graduated from Harvard way back in 1986 although since then she is served as law school dean there from 2003 to 2009. So her ties to that school are awfully strong.
