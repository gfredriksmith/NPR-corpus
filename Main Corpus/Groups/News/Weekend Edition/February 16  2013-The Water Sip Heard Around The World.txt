SEN.  Good evening. I am Marco Rubio.  It is being called Water-bottlegate.   Let me begin by...  Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida gave the Republican rebuttal to President Obama's State of the Union message. The senator criticized the president's proposals as adding to the cost size and scope of government when private industry needs to create new more and better-paying jobs. But many people on social media platforms could not seem to stop chattering about the way Sen. Rubio had to lurch left - to reach for a bottle of drinking water.  ...then false choices like the one the president laid out tonight.  The choice is not  just...  As it was later reported he would just given the same speech in Spanish for 18 minutes before speaking in English. So the senator was parched. This week he is tweeted himself for his ill-timed thirst and tweeted out a photo of his water bottle. And his political action committee now offers a Rubio water bottle for a donation of 25 or more.
