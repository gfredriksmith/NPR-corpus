 Since we put out the word that we are trying to find people who will attend the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama we have received lots of responses but we want more. So if you managed to snag one of the 250000 golden tickets to the ceremony let Weekend Edition know how did you get tickets? Who is going with you? Who is not? How are you getting to Washington? Join the multimedia fun and tell us everything. We accept video logs blog posts tweets and email. To find out more go to npr.orgsoapbox. You are listening to Weekend Edition from NPR News.
