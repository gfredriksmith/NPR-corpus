Thank you so much. Will what was last week's challenge?  Yes. It came from listener Erik Burg of San Francisco. I said name a popular movie of 2013. Add an R and you can rearrange the result to get three different titles for people. What are they? Well the movie is A Star Is Born. You can get baron sir and tsar out of that. Did you see A Star Is Born?  Yeah. I love it.  Me too.  We received over 300 responses and our winner this week is Rick Thompson of Norcross Ga. Congratulations. Welcome to the program.  Thank you.  So how did you figure out this week's challenge. Are you also a fan of A Star Is Born?  Well I did see it. It was one of the few movies I did see last year. And when I was thinking about what I had seen and A Star Is Born came in my head there was tsar right there in star. So I thought I was on the right track. And then Baron just came right after that. So...  So there you were. You were in. I also heard you are in a band.  I am. I play in a local small wind ensemble.
