 Did you assume that dinosaurs did not eat like ladies and gentlemen? In 2004 scientists discovered some dinosaur tracks in St. George Utah. Now after several years of research paleontologists say those tracks reveal that dinosaurs of the early Jurassic period did not just lower their heads and start guzzling and chomping when they got hungry. Andrew Milner is city paleontologist and curator at the dinosaur discovery site at Johnson Farm in St. George. Mr.  So this animal actually sat down on the slope which brought the arms close to the sediments. So it was able to put its hands down into the mud. And this is the first clear evidence of hand impressions preserved as a trace fossil of a meat-eating dinosaur.  And that dinosaur was Theropod a two-footed dino that had arms and hands with claws it would use to get food - or possibly signal the waiter. Mr. Milner says the discovery may cause museums to change the ways that they depict meat-eating dinosaurs in their displays. Mr.  You look at a lot of old meat-eating dinosaur reconstructions and what they show are the palms turned downward so facing the ground. And what we actually see here is the hands are turned inwards.  But did they know which spoon to use? Andrew Milner co-wrote a paper about the discovery for the online journal PLoS ONE.
