 We are joined now by the BBC's Jonah Fisher in Johannesburg. Welcome to the program.  Thank you.  We mentioned the attacks last year against foreigners. Have last week's activity in any way mirrored the way that those other attacks started last year?  They sent a minister straight out there because that is really the big concern here that this frustration - which at the moment is about basic services like electricity water lack of housing - might end up being targeted on those foreigners basically fellow Africans who have come to South Africa for economic reasons.  You mentioned a government representative. Has there been any sort of crackdown on these demonstrations?  Jacob Zuma the new president here has made it pretty clear that while he does understand to a certain extent people's complaints the minute things turn violent the minute they start blocking roads and burning tires in the streets that is when it becomes unacceptable. And he backs the police 100 percent in their efforts for them to stop them.  In the few months that President Zuma has been in office has he been able to make any progress on his promises?  Now Jacob Zuma has promised to try and address these concerns about local officials about corruption about nepotism which exists at that level. But I think everyone accepts that it is going to take quite a long time to tackle what has become quite a deep-rooted problem.  Jonah Fisher is a BBC reporter in Johannesburg. Thank you.  Thank you very much.
