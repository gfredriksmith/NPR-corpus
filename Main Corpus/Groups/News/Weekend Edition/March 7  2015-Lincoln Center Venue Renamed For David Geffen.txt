 What is in a name? A hundred-million dollars? This week Lincoln Center announced that the Avery Fisher Hall the famous concert venue will became David Geffen Hall. Mr. Geffen the Hollywood producer is paying 100 million to help renovate the hall and get his name on it after Lincoln Center reportedly paid the family of Avery Fisher the audio pioneer and philanthropist who died in 1994 15 million for the Fisher name to disappear. Katherine Farley Lincoln Center's chairwoman told reporters David has been in the music world forever and here you have this iconic music hall so it seemed like a very good match. Mr. Geffen added and I had the money.
