 There were a lot of long faces in Chicago when the city learned it was not getting the 2016 Olympics. NPR's David Schaper has the reaction from Chicago. Mr.  The City of Chicago having obtained the least number of votes will not participate in the next round.   That collective gasp was uttered by thousands of Chicagoans gathered at Daly Plaza downtown for what they had hoped would be a victory rout. Instead most stood silently stunned and bewildered including Summer Alexander. Ms.  I cannot see what went wrong. I mean it is a damper on things. It is a downer.  Ted O'Malley of suburban Park Ridge was... Mr. TED O' Shocked. Disappointed. I had no thought whatsoever that  whatsoever. Mr. EMMETT O' I thought we were going to win. I really thought we were going to win.  And that is 11-year-old Emmett O'Malley. His dad Ted adds... Mr. O' Well that is the life of being a sports fan living in the city of Chicago. Ms.  I feel like we are always the second city. It is never going to change. You know? So... Mr. O' We are not even the second city though in this voting. We are the fourth. Ms.  Yeah that hurts ouch. We are like the Tulsa of the Olympics.  Ms.  Sorry Tulsa.  A disappointed Annie Colbert reached for some explanation for the IOC vote. Ms.  The sort of old school network of voting and that is how they vote. Mr. O' Could Chicago have been out-politicked on this?  Ms.  I do not know if anyone can out-politic Chicago. That would probably be the biggest insult to the city.   But some Chicagoans do not mind losing the Olympics. At a caf called Zanzibar Sobe Gugat pumped his fists with joy. Mr.  I was ecstatic. This is a great city and I am really glad that the IOC is not going to come here to destroy it.  Austin Campion also was not eager to get the Olympics. Mr.  It is complicated and expensive and trafficky.  But Campion admits this international rejection does sting a little. David Schaper NPR News Chicago.
