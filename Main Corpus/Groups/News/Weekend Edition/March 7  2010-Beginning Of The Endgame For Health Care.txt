 Mara good morning.  Good morning Liane.  Give us an idea of where things stand now and what do you expect in the coming weeks?  This is a frantic final push to heave this piece of legislation over the finish line.  One of the issues that seems to be holding things up is abortion.  However the Senate did not like that language. They put different language in their bill that Stupak and he says about 11 other Democrats will not accept. That is something that is being worked on but they have not found a solution yet.  Explain What arguments - is the president making to lawmakers who previously voted no? And for that matter what is he saying to those who are already on board?  He is saying to people who had voted no - actually we do not know what he is saying to them. There are probably a lot of offers being made to those people a lot of special deals. But he is making the big argument that this is why we are Democrats and to have this thing fail would show that our party is ineffective and cannot govern.  Democrats seem to be getting a lot of bad news lately retirements in Congress scandals in New York. Do you think they can keep their focus on health-care overhaul with all of these distractions?  The political handicapper Charlie Cook believes that when you get up to 10 retirements in Republican-leaning districts you are officially in the danger zone. The Democrats are not there yet but they are getting close.  NPR's national political correspondent Mara Liasson thanks Mara. Take care of that throat get some honey.  Thank you Liane.
