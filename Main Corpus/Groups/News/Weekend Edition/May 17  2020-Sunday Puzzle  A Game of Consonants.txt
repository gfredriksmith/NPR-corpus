Yes. It came from listener Jerry Heckler of Chardon Ohio. I said name the make and model of a popular car. Change the first and last letters of the make to name an animal and change the first and fourth letters of the model to name another animal. What car is it? And it is the Toyota Corolla. You get the animals coyote and gorilla.  We received over 400 correct responses. And the winner this week is Lena Porell of Tucson Ariz. Congratulations and welcome to the program.  Thank you. Glad to be here.  So how did you figure it out?  Well at first I - me and my friend had read the instructions wrong. So we reread it and then kind of just went through different makes and models until we got to Toyota Corolla.  Yeah. I understand that you are new to The Puzzle. Welcome to the family.  Thank you.
