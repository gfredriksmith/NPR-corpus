 Guitar Hero was introduced in 2005 and as NPR's Felix Contreras reports it helped build a new generation of classic rock fans.   After creating more than a dozen versions of the game Activision Blizzard Inc. announced the Guitar Hero franchise has been losing money. It racked up about 1.7 billion dollars in just three years but eventually the market became saturated.  Anyone who has a console who wants Guitar Hero has it.  Michael Pachter is a research analyst for Wedbush Securities.  So the only real market opportunity is new console purchasers and the company looked at that and said it does not make sense to keep a staff of 250 people full time trying to build new iterations of the game when we are not going to sell very many units.  Mr. PACHTER. And it will be something that you know our kids talk about how their parents used to play this funky old game Guitar Hero like I remember my dad playing Pong.   Guitar Hero also helped create interest in bands that probably had not seen new revenue streams since they put away their leather pants. The game created an unlikely new fan base for bands like The Ramones Black Sabbath Aerosmith and Van Halen. Mike McGuire is vice president of research for Gartner's Media Industries.  Prior to that game they would have thought Jeez Dad do not break out the old CD or God forbid the record collection.  But what was once square is now cool.  There is a whole host of I am sure young guitar players now heard about and maybe discovered a lot of new material and music with that particular game.    Twenty-twenty-twenty-four hours to go. I wanna be sedated. Nothin' to do nowhere to go I wanna be sedated.  Felix Contreras NPR News.
