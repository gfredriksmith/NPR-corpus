 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Protestors in Wisconsin may be right may be wrong but they have plenty to eat. A pizza place called Ian's in Madison is feeding demonstrators.

Pizza orders for protesters have come from dozens of states and several countries including Egypt. It is MORNING EDITION.
