 Good morning. I am David Greene. A Massachusetts woman heard a loud bang in her house and called police thinking it was a home invasion. Officers arrived did a search and found no signs of foul play - except a duck. It had come through the chimney and flown into a ceiling leaving what police described as a perfect sooty silhouette. They released the bird into a nearby pond but are still seeking a positive identification. Guess it is not enough that it walks like a duck and talks like a duck. It is MORNING EDITION. Quack.
