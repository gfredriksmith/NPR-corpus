 Bob Dylan was known as the voice of his generation. But at this point he is speaking to several generations. With his latest album Dylan has become the first artist to have a Top 40 new album in every decade since the '60s.  The album Rough And Rowdy Ways came out earlier this month.    Twas a dark day in Dallas November '63.  Let us revisit a few highlights. In the '60s Dylan captured eight Top 40 albums.    The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind. The answer is blowin' in the wind.  He had 14 in the 1970s.    Lord knows I have paid some dues. Getting through tangled up in blue.  Seven in the '80s.    Never meant to be spoken everything is broken.  Four in the '90s and we start to hear the bard's voice get older and a little gravellier.    It is not dark yet but it is getting there.  Going into the 21st century Dylan had seven Top 40 albums in the aughts.    Someday baby you as not gonna worry po' me anymore.  And nine in the 2010s.    The pale moon rose in its glory out on a Western town. She told a sad sad story of the great ship that went down.  Now this latest album is his first for this decade. But do not forget we have just begun the decade.    Goodbye Jimmy Reed goodbye.
