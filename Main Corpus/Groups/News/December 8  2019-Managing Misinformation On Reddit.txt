 The discussion and news aggregation site Reddit sees some of the most web traffic in the United States ranking higher than both Netflix and Instagram. In Reddit is forums called subreddits users find cooking advice book recommendations thriving TV discussions all sorts of topics - including politics. Our next guest moderates the main political subreddit rpolitics. We are not calling him by his name because threats of physical harm and doxxing are so common on Reddit. He goes by the username Qu1nlan and he told us that he sees mostly talk about impeachment these days. And though it has a slight leftward lean politically there are users on Reddit from all over the political spectrum. QU1 We see a lot of really high-level good faith discussion with people citing links citing sources talking about why they think the way they do. But we also see some people who are just saying Trump 2020 or impeach him lock him up. But we do see people changing their minds about lower-level less divisive things such like do you support gender-inclusive restrooms or do you support the Keystone XL pipeline? - things like that.  We here at NPR have been covering quote unquote fake news in its original sense - you know disinformation misleading information masked as journalism or facts - for years now. How do you and your team of moderators deal with that? QU1 In short we do not. We are a team of about 50 moderators on a subreddit of 5.6 million people. We do not have resources that a team like Facebook or Twitter might have with tons and tons of paid fact-checkers. So generally when we see fake news that we know is not factually correct we will go ahead and encourage our user base to go ahead and fact-check it themselves and also comment - say well here's why this news is fake and here is the sources to back it up. And here's why you should not believe everything that you see on the Internet.  It sounds like a pretty unregulated community. Is that what you like about it? QU1 Well I think that unregulated is not the word that I would necessarily use for it. But I think that...  Self-regulated I think would be a better word. QU1 I think self-regulated is a great word for this. And people are using civility and discussing things in a fashion that would not necessarily be used on other forums in the Internet with more anonymity such as places like 4chan or even any other places any other online forums with the requirement to create a username rather than use your real name.  But I must ask you - you are unpaid right? You do not get paid to do this. You volunteer your time. But the reason we are not referring to you by name is because of concerns about doxxing and users actually threatening you. That does not sound very civil. QU1 Thankfully it is rare that people will come in and threaten us with things like doxxing things like personal harm. But when that does happen it is very serious and we will try to get protection from ourselves. Personally I have been doxxed in the past. So I got my name in the Reddit-wide filter which means that my full real name cannot actually be set on Reddit that it will get automatically removed by the robots. So I am very thankful that the Reddit admins also take it seriously.  You have been doing this for four or five years now. What have you seen change? QU1 I have seen a lot change. Back in the Obama administration we had a lot of quiet times. And that was really nice to be honest as a moderator. We had people just generally discussing the issues. But as we have progressed through the 2016 election and the actual Trump presidency I personally have seen incivility shoot up. I have seen things like hate speech shoot up. I have seen a lot of people a little bit more afraid to accept sources and in general a lot more divisiveness.  I guess my last question is do moderators ever change beats? QU1 So I am very thankful that politics is not my only subreddit. I am also a big geek personally and I moderate the Star Wars subreddit. So whenever politics becomes a little bit too much for me - I have had too many slurs for one day or I have had too many sources that I have to read in one day - I will go ahead and I will read about baby Yoda. And that'ill make me feel better.   Hear hear - although I have to tell you Star Wars can also get pretty contentious. QU1 Oh I should tell you sometime about The Last Jedi movie release. That was something.  That is the Reddit moderator who goes by the username Qu1nlan. Thank you so much. QU1 Thank you Lulu.
