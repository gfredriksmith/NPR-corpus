 It is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Steve Inskeep.  As NPR's Carrie Johnson reports people who study national security say the number of criminals who turn to extremism behind bars is small but worrisome.  Mark Hamm who teaches criminology at Indiana State University studied the case.  I mean this is fairly remarkable that you can send somebody off to a maximum security prison and while behind bars they can still wage a terrorist attack.  Gregory Saathoff studies prison radicalization at the University of Virginia. He says the case exposed a vulnerability.  Depending on budgets and priorities there are some states that are much less able to devote resources just in terms of understanding what is going on within their prisons.  Laura Murphy leads the Washington office of the American Civil Liberties Union.  This approach is just a recipe for sensationalizing and scaring people and turning neighbor against neighbor and it promotes racial profiling and religious intolerance.  But Congressman Peter King a Republican from New York who is leading the hearing told Fox News he is not scapegoating a whole religion.  Prisoners in jail often are looking for a new alternative. And being converted to Islam there is actually nothing wrong with that. In fact in many cases it is ideal for prisoners. This is the religion they have been looking for.  Again Mark Hamm.  And this religious foundation can be very esoteric and also very seductive. It can constitute sort of cherry-picking versions of the Holy Quran and putting them together in such a way that they seem to justify violence against infidels.  Carrie Johnson NPR News Washington.
