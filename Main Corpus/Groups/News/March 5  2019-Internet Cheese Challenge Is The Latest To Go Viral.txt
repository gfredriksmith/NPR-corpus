 Good morning. I am David Greene. Now I am convinced if aliens are watching us they think we are the weirdest species in the universe because we have begun throwing cheese at our children and laughing about it. This began with one father's video that went viral. Parents everywhere then agreed it was cute to toss cheese slices at babies' faces and record their reactions which have ranged from surprise to tears. What are aliens going to see us doing next talking to our refrigerators? You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
