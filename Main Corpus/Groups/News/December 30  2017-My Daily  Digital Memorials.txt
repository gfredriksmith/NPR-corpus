 We have all been listening to what we in the broadcast biz call year-enders the most popular books music movies of the year and of course the always-moving lists of people who died this year mostly famous people. But we also have our lists of people in our private lives. Our close friend's Christmas dinner always includes toasts to people who are no longer at the table. It is a moment of memory we welcome and dread at the same time. We all have our own ways of remembering our dead and I want to share mine with you. I have a daily digital memorial. It is a password. Every day I settle down with whatever digital device I am using at the time and type in a password at the office at home in a cab. The first time I did this it was my mother's name. She is been dead for almost 30 years. Like most women from our part of the country she had two first names. She also had two husbands. Therefore lots of names to choose among making it possible for me to combine and recombine them for years both for comfort and for security's sake. My father was next. I used his names for several years. And each time I typed those names into the computer the person came into my mind. I felt my passwords were digital insurance against losing all the memories I have of being a child of these two people - of working with my dad at his grocery store of learning to cook with my mother of family stories I heard from them. When I created new passwords sometimes I put their numbers in - ancient phone numbers dates combinations that mean something only to me and them. It was a shock when I first entered the name of a close family member who was younger than I was when she died. I thought about that and I thought about who is next on my password list. But then I got a grip and I invited her memory to come in and comfort me.
