 The communist government in Cuba is loosening its grip on  the country's economy. That is left thousands of small private businesses to  spring up. It is really a new frontier for budding capitalists and competition  is fierce. And yet advertising is still tightly restricted and so  entrepreneurs have to build their reputations in other ways - excelling in  customer service maybe it is dcor maybe better pricing. Nick Miroff has the  story from Havana.         New snack bars and food stalls are all over Havana but there  are not many that look like Tio Tito or Uncle Tito. The first thing you notice  is the uniformed employees scrambling to serve up Hawaiian pizzas and fruit  drinks as music videos play on a monitor behind the counter.        The napkins and the to-go containers carry the Tio Tito company logo and  there is even a slick web site Tio-Tito.com which is hosted abroad. That  red-and-gold color scheme is no coincidence either said proprietor and  would-be Cuban fast-food king Ivan Garcia. If those colors can work for  McDonalds he says they just might work for him.                   Those are the colors that stimulate the appetite Garcia said. I did not  make that up it is what the research shows.        Garcia's business is only one of two start-up snack stands to make it in his  Havana neighborhood. Six others have already gone under since last fall when  President Raul Castro let more Cubans go into business for themselves. These  days it is no longer enough to hang a sign outside and sell sandwiches and  coffee out the front door.       Ismael Bello another Havana entrepreneur said the city's got too many vendors  trying to sell the same things so he is trying something different. With a new  copy machine brought in from abroad Bello and his family have started a  printing and copy service called Avana with an attractive freshly-painted  storefront. He is competing directly with the Cuban government setting prices  at half what they are in state-owned copy shops.                  In five years we could be a pretty big company Bello said. Next month  we will have our web site and if we keep adding products and services we can  grow he said.        It is not clear how big Cuban authorities will let these new businesses get as  they try to build their brands and open new locations. The government's  political messages and propaganda must now compete with more and more  commercial signage but advertising is still essentially banned.        So Cubans like Yanet Alvarez have found other ways to stand out. Her  baseball-themed snack bar the Perfect Play is quickly becoming famous among  fans of Havana's beloved team the Industriales attracting crowds to her  converted garage.        Everything on the menu is named for something in the game including a few  rather unappetizing-sounding dishes like the Dead Ball and the Squeeze Play.  But after toiling for years in drab state-run restaurants Alvarez said it is  exhilarating to be making her own business decisions. She even used the F word  to describe it.          If a customer orders a sandwich you have  the the freedom to say sure I will make it however you want it.        That kind of choice is something of a novel concept in a country where  nearly everyone still gets an identical government food ration. And the  have-it-your-way ethos is not the only formula being copied here. One new Havana  establishment is calling itself Burger Rey with rey meaning king in Spanish.  For now with the U.S. embargo still firmly in place and no Whoppers to compete  with the market is wide open.        For NPR News I am Nick Miroff in Havana.
