 You are listening to WEEKEND EDITION from NPR News. And it is time for sports.   NPR's Mike Pesca is on the line from New York. Good morning Mike.  Hey.  There is a little wrestling news to talk about this morning. There was this big landmark wrestling match last week between Iran and the U.S. that took place in Grand Central Station right?  Grand Central yeah. I was there. The Russians were involved too quite exciting.  Very exciting.  Yeah.  There was supposed to be a rematch between the Iranians and the U.S. in L.A. today. It is not going to happen.  No the Iranians pulled out. They got the Russians and Canadians to fill their slot. That will not thrill the you know few thousand Persian-Americans who already bought tickets but what can you do?  Oops. OK. But I understand there is actually a larger story about wrestling in the ether right now.  Yeah a huge story that is going to have an effect on its future. You know they will be wrestling in the next Olympics. Wrestling's been in every Olympics since they started them. In 1900 there was no wrestling but you know wrestling and the marathon the most important Olympic sports but they voted out wrestling in 2020. In 2024 there is a chance for the sport itself to work its way back in after a couple of international votes. But yes wrestling - let us go with the pun - is on the mat.  Ooh OK. So they are trying to make some changes to make sure they can participate. What are they floating as possibilities?  Right. So the first reaction was indignant and how could this happen? And you know the countries like Iran and the U.S. and Russia they were very upset and they mobilized their forces. Like in politics the base was upset. But they also know they have to do some outreach and they also know they have to change a little bit. So some of the things they are talking about are things like maybe we should change. There is no reason it has to be a circular mat. They have been talking to the MMA guys. MMA has an octagon.  This is the martial arts people.  Mixed martial arts. Maybe wrestling could scrap those singlets the you know onesies that they use and just wrestle in shorts or a T-shirt. And then even the scoring now it is the best two out of three there are three periods. So maybe wrestling could go in for aggregate score. So you do not just win periods whoever wins on the most points would win. That is a change they are considering.  What about making those changes would endear the sport to more people or convince...  Right.  ...the Olympic Committee that they should let wrestling back in?  Well the first couple I mentioned that is just as clear showmanship perhaps versus sportsmanship issue but then when you go with the scoring a lot of the wrestlers I talked to think it would be more exciting to have the score be an aggregate because this way you know there is tension at the very end. It is not the case that some guy just won two rounds. It could all come down to the final seconds. I mean most of the wrestlers think that this would be a bit more exciting and that is what they are going for.   Well I am excited just thinking about it. NPR's Mike Pesca in New York.
