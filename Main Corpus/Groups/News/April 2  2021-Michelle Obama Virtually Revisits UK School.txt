 Good morning. I am Noel King.   Hello Mrs. Obama.  This is a Zoom call between schoolgirls and the former first lady Michelle Obama. As first lady Obama visited two all-girls schools in the U.K. And when she left the White House they kept in touch. Even though it was not in person this meeting was still a success.   You all give me hope because listening to how resilient and determined you have been that is what I see everywhere I go around the world.  It is MORNING EDITION.
