 NPR's business news starts with the power of rare earth minerals.   We are talking here about minerals used in many cell phones and other electronics. They are not really that rare but China controls the world's production of them at the moment and China recently blocked exports of the minerals to Japan after a territorial dispute. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has called on Beijing to explain what it is up to. At a news conference today a Chinese government spokesman said it is not using these minerals as a bargaining tool. However other companies and countries around the world are looking for their own sources. An American firm recently raised around 400 million to restart rare earth mining in California.
