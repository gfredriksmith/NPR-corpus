 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. Motor vehicle officials in Delaware know you want to do it. You are at the DMV. You get a new license. So you take a selfie with the license and post it on social media which means you just published your license number and home address - not secure. The agency has now set up safe selfie zones at motor vehicle offices. You stand in front of a colorful backdrop that says look who is driving - and you keep the license out of sight. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
