 A man who made a lasting contribution to 1960s TV culture has died. Vic Mizzy wrote the theme songs for Green Acres and The Addams Family. He was 93 years old. NPR's Neda Ulaby has his story.  Vic Mizzy was a practitioner of a lost art writing TV theme songs with lyrics that sum up the premise of the show.  Mr.    Green acres is the place to be. Farm living is the life for me. Land spreading out so far and wide. Keep Manhattan just give me that countryside.  Vic Mizzy's themes were upbeat jazzy and they still influence TV theme songs today. Mr.  Vic Mizzy I read your playbook.  Jeff Richmond wrote the theme song to 30 Rock. He says Mizzy knew the secret to a great theme song. Mr.  You want to be able to hear it in the kitchen and know oh my show is on.  Mr.   Bah bah bahm  Mr.   Bah bah bahm  In an earlier interview with the Archive of American Television Mizzy said he wanted the timing in The Addams Family opening sequence to be perfect. So he insisted on using a tool called the click track. Mr.  Well the director Sidney Lanfield he did not know from click track. He said look Vic you wrote it you said it. Why do not you just do it? So I directed the main title on camera.  Unidentified Man  Their house is a museum where people come to see them. They really are a scream. The Addams Family. Neat. Sweet  For The Addams Family theme song Mizzy recorded his own voice and overdubbed it three times. He is playing the harpsichord too. Vic Mizzy used to joke that he bought his mansion in Bel Air with a couple of finger snaps. That is where he died on Saturday. The cause was heart failure. Mizzy's funeral was held today in California. Neda Ulaby NPR News.
