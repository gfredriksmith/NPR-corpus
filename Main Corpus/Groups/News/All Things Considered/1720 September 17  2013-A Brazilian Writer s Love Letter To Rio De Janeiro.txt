 This week while our co-host Melissa Block is in Brazil we thought we would showcase a couple of Brazilian writers. Today Tatiana Salem Levy whose short story Blazing Sun was featured in the literary magazine Granta. Levy splits her time between Rio de Janeiro where she is spent most of her life and Lisbon where she was born. Here she is reading from Blazing Sun which she calls a love letter to Rio.     Few things are more beautiful than the instants that precede momentous things the second before a passionate kiss before a marathon runner crosses the finish line before a rainstorm hits Rio de Janeiro.     Before the water comes crashing down Rio teems with activity. People make a frantic dash for it. Birds disperse in a flurry. Cockroaches scurry. Monkeys leap from branch to branch all seeking shelter a roof of any kind.     The city suddenly begins to palpitate when the humidity reaches an unsustainable level when you know that the hot heavy sticky weather is about to come undone in a downpour.     If you are  lucky enough to be somewhere safe you will soon see nature's strength unleashed supreme reminding us of how fragile and fleeting we are.
