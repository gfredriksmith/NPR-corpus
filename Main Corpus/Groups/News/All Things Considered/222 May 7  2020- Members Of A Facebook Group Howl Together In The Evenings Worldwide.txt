 More than half a million people around the world have found a new outlet for their pandemic-related stress - howling.   That is thanks to a Facebook group called Go Outside and Howl at 8 p.m. Shelsea Ochoa and Brice Maiurro are the group's creators.   There is no wrong way to howl.  Just howl however you feel.   From Oshkosh Wisc. we are howling at the moon.   Tonight I am howling for grandparents everywhere.   One style of howl is the passionate loud and sharp and bright. .  A wolf chicken howl.   And also the I-might-have-been-raised-by-wolves-because-I am-so-good-at-howling howl.   A very timid howl - like I-hope-this-is-OK-with-everyone howl.   Some people I feel like I can hear the pain in their howls.  Yeah there is longing in a lot of howling.  And grieving.   People howl for lost loved ones.  About domestic violence.  And of course frontline workers health care workers.   The reason that wolves howl is to stay connected and when they are looking for each other.   I think that is totally on point with the reason why people are drawn to howling too. It is to feel less lonely.   So come outside at 8 of the clock and howl.  Or howl right now if you want to.   That moment was produced by NPR's Abby Wendle. .
