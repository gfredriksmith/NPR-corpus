 Well now Melissa we have been calling it soda here which may have some of you in other places yelling at us it is not soda. It is pop. Or if you are from the South you may call it Coke. You may use that to describe any carbonated beverage.  well Robert you know that I am from New York like you are and it tastes like soda to me.  Me too but this divides America like few other questions. Just ask Luanne von Schneidemesser senior editor at the Dictionary of American Regional English at the University of Wisconsin.  They call more about that question than any other.   Yeah von Schneidemesser says the divide is often clearly regional. Soda in the Northeast pop in the Upper Midwest. But there are exceptions. Eastern Wisconsin bucks the Great Lakes trend Robert and goes with soda.  Way to go Milwaukee.  Right. But the soft drink battle lines are never static. Von Schneidemesser says the term Coke appears to be migrating northward.  Really? In New York we will not hear about a soda ban but a Coke ban?  Oh it will probably be a couple of decades but you might.  Well just make sure you buy it in a 16-ounce cup or smaller.
