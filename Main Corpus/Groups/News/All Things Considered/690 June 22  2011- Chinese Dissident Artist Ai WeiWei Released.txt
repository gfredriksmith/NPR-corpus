 NPR's Rob Gifford has the story from Shanghai.  One of the conditions of his bail is not to talk to the press. But before Ai WeiWei arrived at his home tonight his mother Gao Ying spoke briefly to NPR.   Just now about 10 minutes ago they called and told us that Xinhua News Agency has an article saying WeiWei is out on bail. But I have not seen WeiWei yet. He has not come home yet. The specifics I do not know but I think we will keep waiting.  China watcher Jeffrey Wasserstrom of the University of California at Irvine says that Ai WeiWei was certainly the most prominent of the many artists human rights lawyers and Christian activists to be detained.  Ai WeiWei was the most visible symbol of what was just a general chill from the lead up immediately up to the Olympics all the way on up till now we have just seen a tendency toward a tightening of zones of freedom.  Jeffrey Wasserstrom says Chinese politics are so opaque that it is extremely hard to know the reasons that anything happens.  Of course there is a desire for news coverage of China to be more upbeat at the moment as the big celebration of the party's 90th birthday is coming up on July 1st. But I think it is foolish to assume that these kinds of moves are too rational.  Rob Gifford NPR News Shanghai.
