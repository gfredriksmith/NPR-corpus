 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Marc Ribot has spent nearly three decades as a guitarist on the margins someone more interested in experimentation than fame. Well today he and his trio Ceramic Dog have a new album out called Your Turn. And critic Robert Christgau thinks it is one of his most daring.   After six years as a sideman for many soul veterans Marc Ribot made his name in 1985 on Rain Dogs the album that marked Tom Waits' permanent transition from eccentric singer-songwriter into truly weird singer-songwriter. Ribot has held down straight gigs since then - with Alison Krauss and Robert Plant for instance - but his own work has tended very much avant. That is much less true on the song-oriented second album by the trio he calls Ceramic Dog.   Where Ceramic Dog's first album was what you would expect from a Marc Ribot power trio long on experiment and short on tune Your Turn is a straight rock album sonically and structurally except that it is half instrumentals. And the six lyrics are doozies. My fave is Masters of the Internet. If you are one of those freewheelers who downloads music without paying for it you pop up in the very first words you will hear.   Marc Ribot is a political guy - he is long been a union activist on behalf of independent musicians. One of the songs here is a setting for James Oppenheim's century-old sexual equality poem Bread and Roses. But then there is the not-so-PC torch song in which Ribot reunites with an old flame.   Having tossed in a bunch of vocals Ribot lets the instrumentals run free. There is a metal piece a noisefest and synth-style melody. His cover of Dave Brubeck's Take Five is a little more comforting but it is not that comforting. On Your Turn Marc Ribot is not trying to comfort anyone.   We have been listening to music from the album from Marc Ribot and his trio Ceramic Dog. It is called Your Turn. Our critic is Robert Christgau.
