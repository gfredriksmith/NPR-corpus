 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. It is calving season in Nevada's Carson Valley. And that does not just bring more calves it brings bald eagles too. Local officials took note and they are trying to use a natural if disturbing part of ranch life to improve the region's tourism industry. Sarah McBride reports.  Tourists tend to skip Nevada's Carson Valley despite the mountains fields and cottonwood trees. As pretty as it is Lake Tahoe and Las Vegas are nearby. So the valley had to come up with something to get people to come here. Ms.  It looks kind of ropey and gooey and it has hay and grass in it as well.  That is Theresa Grebanitch from Reno. She is looking at fresh cow placenta. She got up close with one thanks to a tour set up by Carson Valley officials. People come from as far away as Florida and Switzerland to see bald eagles and the eagles have come to see the placenta - actually to snack on it. In February and early March thousands of cows give birth to calves in this valley.   Some cows eat the placenta but others turn up their noses. Rancher James Suttlemeyer says that is when the eagles swoop in. Mr.  You have to love the beauty and the magnificence of the bald eagle but we also need to remember they are a scavenger bird.  Carson Valley is kind of a rest stop on a bald eagle winter circuit. Mostly eagles like fish but placenta is too good to pass up. It is nutritious and easy pickings. Suttlemeyer's family's been ranching in the area since the 1880s. Mr.  And when it is an eagle you are happy. When it is the coyote you are not so happy. The coyotes if they pack together will go after the calves.  Now his ranch is a stop on Eagles and Agriculture a once-a-year event. It is year nine for Eagles and Ag as the locals call it. Ranchers throw open their gates. A fleet of tour buses rolls through cruising for eagles. Visitors filled four buses this year but there could have been more. The bald eagle tour completely sold out. So did tours like Raptor Highway and Byway and Owl Prowl. Mr.  Now it is after her. Do you guys see that?  Guides like Dan Caffer give a running commentary like during this tiff between an eagle and... Mr.  It is a red tail way over in the far cottonwood tree and it is been dive bombing her and she is dive bombing it.  Not all the local ranchers are on board. Many think the tours just encourage bad behavior like people sneaking onto their property for a closer look. If visitors get between a cow and her calf they could get hurt. Sometimes people leave gates open and cows escape. Bald eagles eat cow afterbirth in many parts of the country but the Carson Valley has taken a lead in showing it off to tourists and they love it. Kim Pittman from Reno has taken the tour three times. Ms.  I saw them fighting over one of the big pieces. One grabbed it and started to fly off with it and the other bird...  You mean the afterbirth? Ms.  Yes yes and the other bird came after him and he got probably about 20 feet away and dropped it.  Pittman knows that the tour has a certain... Ms.  Yuck factor you know.  Mc But she does not see it that way. Ms.  It is really an escape. You can be totally in your stressful day and you see that bird or you hear it call and it could just pop you right back into that God place.  Eagles and Ag is part of a bigger effort in the Carson Valley to preserve ranching after years of development. Leaders hope the events will get the word out about the Carson Valley's charms.
