 This morning President Trump also repeated his promise to keep parts of the government closed until Congress agrees to fund a border wall. Roughly 800000 federal employees are directly affected by the shutdown. We checked in with a few of them today.  My name is Bethany Moher  and I live in Leadville Colo. My husband is a federal employee with the Department of Energy. He is still an essential employee so we are still not sure he will be getting paid next week. We are actually looking at whether or not we are going to be able to pay our mortgage. We do have three small children so it makes it really difficult for us.  My name is Lori Ott . I live in Lyman Wyo. I work for the IRS and the way this will affect me personally - I have good credit and some savings. So we will live on that. And we will not miss a paycheck until the 31 and then hopefully it will not last too much longer than that. But I think we will be OK. I am an auditor so it will just mean a delay in audits.  My name's Heath Jepson . We live here in Sedalia Mo. I work for the DOD. My wife works for the USDA. She is a food inspector. She has to go to work but is not getting paid. We fully support the border wall. However this shutdown is at a really bad time. It has cut our income in half.  My name is Paul Neil Keiffer Jr . I live in Austin Texas. I am an employee of the Internal Revenue Service. I work at the service center here. I am not considered essential. It means I have to worry about my rent and my electricity. I am definitely worried. I am worried about whether or not I can make my next meal after a certain period of time. So I definitely would appreciate it if the boys up in Washington would get their act together and get this straightened out.  Those are some of the voices of federal employees and their spouses affected by the partial government shutdown.
