 Last night at Busch Stadium in St. Louis vendors stopped selling beer during the seventh inning during the baseball game between the Cardinals and the Mets. It is what they normally do. Now at that point the game was still tied zero-zero and it stayed that way through the ninth inning and the 10th and the 12th and the 15th then the 18th until finally the Mets ended it. Unidentified Announcer And the ballgame is over. The Mets win it it is 20 innings by the score of two-to-one in six hours 53 minutes.  It was one of the longest games in Major League Baseball history 18 scoreless innings. Cards fan Mike Hogan stayed until the end last night long after most of Busch Stadium cleared out. Mr.  This was not only the longest game I have ever been to in person it is the longest event I ever watched on TV or paid any attention to. We were there virtually a workday. We got to the park about 2 of the clock and we left a little after 00. It was quite a day.  That is Cardinals fan Mike Hogan who waited it out nearly seven hours last night to watch his team lose to the Mets.
