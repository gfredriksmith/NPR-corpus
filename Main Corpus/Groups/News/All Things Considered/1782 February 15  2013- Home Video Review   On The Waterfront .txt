 Now to an Oscar-winning crime drama a tale of moral crisis from 1954 that is been brushed up and restored for modern home viewing. On the Waterfront is now out in a Blu-ray edition and our critic Bob Mondello has been watching.   Mugs and palookas racketeers and dock workers mob boss Lee J. Cobb running the union with an iron fist Marlon Brando tripping up its control when Eva Marie Saint appeals to his conscious urging him to go to the feds and rat out the rats.   Director Elia Kazan knew from trouble. Two years before making On the Waterfront he would named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee becoming the most notorious Hollywood figure in the communist witch hunts of the 1950s. Though screenwriter Budd Schulberg always denied a connection to the film's plot Brando's character is also called to testify.   He is also castigated and reviled before giving a full-throated defense of his testimony.   Kazan wrote many years later that he would intended the parallels but when Brando yells at the mob boss that was him too.   Glad I would testified as I had.   Included in Criterion's boxed set is the text of an ad Kazan took out defending his naming of names. But as it was with audiences in 1954 the film is the thing here a superb Blu-ray transfer all velvety blacks and shimmering whites not a scratch or flaw anywhere. In a bow to the era when TV was making Hollywood rethink screen size a second disk has the complete film in two other aspect ratios widescreen and full-frame. Which means that there are three different ways to watch Brando make a vibrant case for method acting.   No madness to his method in On the Waterfront. I am Bob Mondello.   Pretty tough to follow Brando. This is NPR News.
