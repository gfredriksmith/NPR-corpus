 Britain's House of Commons has just chosen a new speaker. He is Sir Lindsay Hoyle a member of the opposition Labour Party. Hoyle replaces John Bercow who with his foghorn voice and rhetorical acrobatics became a breakout Brexit star. Bercow stepped down last week after a decade in the job. Now as NPR's Frank Langfitt reports from London Bercow is the star of a Belgian dance track called Order.   Bercow sounds like a character from Downton Abbey with a vocabulary that would strain the bindings of a thesaurus so perhaps it was inevitable that a European musician would immortalize him with a track named after Bercow's signature word.    Order.  It is the work of Belgian DJ and drummer Michael Schack with a comedian supplying a spot-on impression of Bercow including this moment when the House voted down then-Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal by the largest margin in British history.    The ayes to the right 202 the nos to the left 432 - so the nos have it. The nos have it. Unlock.  There is even a music video where a puppet depicting Bercow warns British lawmakers to behave themselves just as the real Bercow did...    The rules of this House are clear. The House must behave with decorum.  ...At which point Bercow and puppets depicting Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn shake their heads wildly to the beat beneath flashing red purple and yellow lights as if in a nightclub.    Members must calm down. This debate must be conducted in a seemly manner.  Bercow may be gone from the speaker's chair but his distinctive way with words may live on on dance floors across Europe. Frank Langfitt NPR News London.    Calm. Order.  No idea how Frank Langfitt made it through that without laughing.
