 This is a voice we used to hear all the time a voice that is gone silent in the past two years.  I hope I am judged a success. I am going to be dead Matt when they finally figure it out. And I am comfortable knowing that I gave it my all that I love America and that I know it is an honor to serve.  We have a review of Decision Points now from the presidential historian H.W. Brands.  The war in Afghanistan was necessary to root out al-Qaida and the Taliban and create a free society in central Asia he says. The war in Iraq turned out to be based on faulty intelligence but the consequence of the American occupation was a chance for democracy to take root in the Persian Gulf.  Damn right. And he still thinks he was right.  If we are really looking at another Great Depression you can be damn sure I am going to be Roosevelt not Hoover.  Bush closes by saying he is comfortable with the fact that history's verdict on his presidency will not come until after he is gone. That is just as well since history is not likely to be as easy on him as he is on himself.  Historian H.W. Brands is the author of Traitor to his Class about President Franklin Roosevelt.
