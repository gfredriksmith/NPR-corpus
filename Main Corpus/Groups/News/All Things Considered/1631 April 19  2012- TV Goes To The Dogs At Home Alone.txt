 A new TV channel is going to the dogs.  It is TV that is shot from a dog's perspective.  That is Becky Lubeach of DOGTV.  It is been enhanced that - the colors that they see pop out. And the music has all been composed for them.  In other words entertainment made not for you but for your stay-at-home hound. No sitcoms about dogs no Jersey Shore no ads either.  Lubeach says DOGTV's programming is scientifically developed for dogs left alone and it is programmed by time of day.   In the morning content to get the dog up and playing.  And that stimulation could be two dogs playing tug-of-war. It could be playing with some kids outside - those types of things.   Midday programming is meant to calm your pet down. There is also a learning side called Exposure.   Like the mailman coming to the front door. Or my dog was actually featured in a segment where he went to the vet - shot down low for that. A dog can experience things that they might not encounter in everyday life.   Dog lovers do not check your local cable listings just yet. DOGTV is available online for free to any Internet-savvy pooch. But the cable TV version is only available right now in San Diego.  But never fear Its creators hope to land a distribution deal soon and unleash DOGTV nationwide.
