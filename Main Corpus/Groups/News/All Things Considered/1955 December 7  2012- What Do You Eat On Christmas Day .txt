 The holiday season is a time for food and a time for sharing and we need you. We would like to know what you usually eat on Christmas Day regardless of whether you celebrate the holiday. Who knows? You may be stuck at work like some of us.  Is there a meal that is a must-have or a dessert or perhaps something completely oddball that you are almost chagrined to admit? Our staff has figgy pudding chocolates and Chinese food by the way which actually sounds pretty gross come to think of it but we eat it anyway.  We are looking for your favorite foods on Christmas Day and why they are special to you.  Good times not-so-good times it does not matter. We want to hear your stories.  We will take a few of them and share on the air Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. So write to us at NPR.org. Click on Contact Us at the bottom of the page and please put Christmas Food in the subject line.
