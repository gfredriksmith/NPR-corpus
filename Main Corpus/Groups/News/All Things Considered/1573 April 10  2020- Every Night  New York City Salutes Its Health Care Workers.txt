 At a time when social distancing has many of us feeling isolated audio producer Gary Hardcastle finds community and his city's nightly display of appreciation for the health care workers facing the COVID-19 pandemic.  My wife and I are alone on the roof of our apartment building in Manhattan eight floors above our neighborhood's residential streets. The sun is setting on a beautiful spring day but the streets are nearly empty.   We wait. At 7 p.m. it starts.   A lone clap.   Now windows are going up and folks across the street are on their fire escapes with pots and pans.   Horns are added to the mix.   The neighborhood is at full volume. My wife joins.  Woo-hoo .   Every day now in our city and around the world medical workers are risking their lives.  Woo-hoo.  The applause the cheering is to show we care.   It goes on for two or three more minutes. My wife smiles at me and I hand her my microphone. Whoa. Yeah. Whoa. Yeah. For NPR News I am Gary Hardcastle in Inwood Manhattan.
