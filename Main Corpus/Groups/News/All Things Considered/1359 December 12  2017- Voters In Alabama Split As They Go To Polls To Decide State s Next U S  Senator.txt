 At some point tonight we should know who will be Alabama's next U.S. senator filling the seat that opened when Jeff Sessions became attorney general. The Republican candidate Roy Moore was thought to be a shoo-in until reports last month of allegations from several women who say Moore was either inappropriate with them or sexually assaulted them as teenagers. Moore's opponent Doug Jones is trying to become the first Democratic U.S. senator to be elected from Alabama in 25 years.  Voters in Alabama are split and so are some families. Thirty-three-year-old Kimberly Pettit  of Birmingham says she voted for Jones.  He is a good decent man. He is had zero scandals. You know he is been a church man his whole life. He comes from a blue-collar family. You know and there is been way too many embarrassments coming from Roy Moore - way too many. And I am tired of the state of Alabama being an embarrassment. So go Doug Jones.  Her 70-year-old father Russ Pettit  voted for Moore.  Innocent until proven guilty. He went 40 years without any scandals and then all of a sudden before the election here come all these people popping out of the woodwork. Maybe he did something 40 years ago. And if he did he was a different person then. But right now I think it is all political.  And thanks to WBHM for those interviews.
