  You are hearing one of the many action sequences from the new film Prince of Persia. It stars Jake Gyllenhaal who plays a peasant turned royal warrior in sixth century Persia. He carries a magic dagger that can turn back time.   Arrows fly swords swing but dialogue - well that is not this film's strong suit.   Prince of Persia is the latest in a string of recent movies reviving the old sword and sandals formula that was popular back in the 1950s and '60s pictures like Ben-Hur and Cleopatra. But is that formula successful today? Well if there is one person who has the answer it is Bob Mondello our film critic. Bob hi.  Good to see you.  And I am happy to see that for this occasion you are in full Roman battle gear.   These are my people after all the Romans.  So what qualifies as a sword and sandals picture?  Well there were two kinds of them. One was the ones you just mentioned which were things like Ben-Hur and The Robe and Greatest Story Ever Told and the other was the kind of cheapy that was made in Italy back then - the Hercules movies and the Samson movies and the big splashy things. And they always had some kind of a weightlifter in the lead rather an actor. They were dubbed. They had belly dancing - had to have a lot of belly dancing -and some kind of legendary creature which would probably threaten the lead at some point. They had titles like The Fury of Achilles or Kindar the Invulnerable or something like that. You know they would just make things up.  Am I crazy in thinking that there has been a flurry of these kinds of films recently like this year?  Yeah there have. You are absolutely right. Let me think there was Clash of the Titans there was Percy Jackson and the Olympian.  Right.  I think that is a high school student who discovers that his father is actually Poseidon.   You know that happened to me recently.  Exactly. Mine's Apollo. There have been those and this new one Prince of Persia and you want to throw in Sex and the City too.  Yeah right. Right.  They went to Abu Dhabi after all.  Right. Of course. Yes.  So there is a lot of things that are set in that part of the world.  And I have got to say Bob I have seen some of those films that you have mentioned and - how do I put this - none of them are Ben-Hur or...  Yeah that is putting it mildly.  Right.  Most of these are not very good movies. They are however popular. And they play well overseas. The logic being that you do not actually have to understand the whole of English to be able to get the dialogue.  There is dialogue in it? There is English?   Of course.  Now we were talking before as we often do before we have these conversations there is one film that you liked.  Well there is a picture called Agora. And this one is a little different from these others. It is set in Alexandria in Egypt it is 390 A.D. roughly and the Romans are in charge and they are annoyed at the Christians who are getting uppity.  Unidentified Man 1   The Christians have gathered in the Agora. They are mocking the gods. We must put an end to these insults. They may not fear him but they will fear our swords.  He was talking about Zeus when he said him.  Yeah.  And this turns out to be a very bad idea that they go after the Christians the Christians then take over. And the Christians were meanies back then.  And this is actually one of the films that you think was pretty good right?  Well it is better than the others because it is a kind of a wonderful dissertation on fundamentalism because the Christians who come in have some very specific ideas about the way people should be reacting to their god and they do not want hear anything from anybody else. And the Jews have some very interesting notions about this too and so these three religions are crashing up against each other - the pagans and the Jews and the Christians. And there is this one scientist among all of them and her name is Hypatia. And she is sort of aloof from all of this. She is working with astronomy and stuff and trying to figure out why the Earth does not seem to be the center of things which is all...  And this is played by Rachel Weisz.  Right.  Ms.   As far as I am aware your god has not yet proved himself to be more just or more merciful than his predecessors. Unidentified Man  Maybe. Ms.  Is it really just a question of time before I accept your fate? Unidentified Man  Why then should this assembly accept the consult of someone who admittedly believes in absolutely nothing? Ms.  I believe in philosophy.  Is it worth spending 9 at the movie theater to see it?  Well I thought it was kind of interesting. I know you did not. You were actually...  Yeah. I am sorry I am very new at this.  You are.  Yeah. I just thought that the Hypatia character was implausible. You know at the end when everything's crumbling down she will still have philosophy.  Yes. There are some things there that are kind of hard to swallow including the fact that she gets to Copernicus's theories I do not know how many years before he did. But it is an interesting debate to be having the science versus religion thing. You can make a case that that is sort of like doing Ben-Hur or doing The Robe or something like that that we are talking about religion at a grander sense.  That is NPR's film critic Bob Mondello. Bob thanks so much.  It is always a pleasure.
