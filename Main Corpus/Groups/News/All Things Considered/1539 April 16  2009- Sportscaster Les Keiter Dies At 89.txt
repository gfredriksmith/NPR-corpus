 Sportscaster Les Keiter died this week in Hawaii. Keiter was famous for calling any number of heavyweight title fights. But he enjoys a special place in the hearts and memories of New York City baseball fans for being one of the great practitioners of a very special kind of play by play.   And the pitch swung on there is a high towering dive in the right field...  The New York Giants had abandoned the polo grounds in the Harlem after the 1957 season and along with the Brooklyn Dodgers they set up shop on the West Coast. Mind you this was eons before superstations or ESPN or mlb.com. So Giants fans would tune in to hear Keiter in a New York radio station who was reading a pitch by pitch account of the game out in San Francisco. And with taped ballpark ambiance at different levels of excitement and a box that he hit with a stick for the crack of the bat Les Keiter recreated games that he could not see.   And delivers. Ground ball hit down third as  throw to first. It is a high throw and safe at first base will be Gilbreath.  He could not see those games but we could. Les Keiter died on Tuesday two weeks shy of his 90th birthday.
