 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Michele Norris. What would New Year's Day be without predictions about the year to come? Well commentator Andrei Codrescu offers this prediction Things will go wrong.  There is talk now of a digital dark ages brought about by either info-hating nomads or some accident. We are as vulnerable now as Europeans were in the 12th century. The Internet is one big place just like the leftovers of the Roman Empire ripe and ready for a gang of neo-barbarians. The difference is that it took the medieval dark ages years before they got started while it might take but a few seconds to get us to the digital ones. It would take but a few keystrokes to start up the nuclear winter the illiterate millennia or the digital dark ages. The fact that they have not yet occurred is one more proof that our angels are on the job. In Europe back in the 1200s they were sleeping. Now and then the thought of how fragile we are hits me - not like an idea but as a feeling. Tiny human being drives into big tree or big wind sweeps up your house or river sucks you under. Or wireless quits. All this happens all the time but you do not notice it until it happens to 4000 people at once or a million or several million. And the more interconnected we become the more likely it is that what happens to one can instantly happen to many. It amazes me that anything I see is around long enough for me to believe that it is actually there. Many things are not of course still around after I have seen them and I do not miss the ones that vanish before I had a chance to see and miss them. But enough of them are there long enough so I can call them real. I am afraid to sleep for fear they will vanish so I watch and wonder. I know it is not firewalls that keep us safe. It is got to be angels.   Andrei Codrescu edits Exquisite Corpse. That is a literary journal online at corpse.org.
