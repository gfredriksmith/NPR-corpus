 You might know Kentucky singer and songwriter Jim James from his band My Morning Jacket. Well last year he took some time off to work on a solo album. It is called Regions of Light and Sound of God. Our critic Tom Moon says it is an interesting chronicle of James' spiritual quest.  Jim James begins by looking somewhat skeptically at the worship of technology.   Fronting his band My Morning Jacket Jim James often comes across as a seeker someone with a passing curiosity about the metaphysical if not the unknowable. For this project his questioning goes a bit deeper. He is the typical lost soul looking for anything genuine in a sea of artifice. His vulnerable melodies give off a sense of profound doubt. In this song he watches a movie actress on the screen and wonders if personality can be powerful enough to distort reality.   James is not too sure about organized religion either. He does believe in the notion of a higher power and his faith in it animates the best of these songs. He works himself into a mood of fervent conviction to put across this one which explores trust and forgiveness.   People who know My Morning Jacket might hear that and say that Jim James is just re-branding songs his band might have done better. But the rest of the album takes James far from his comfort zone. Playing most of the instruments himself he journeys into the introspective aura of John Lennon's later solo work and upbeat pop grooves that recall Motown in the early '70s.   Shifting away from the intensity of his band recordings James allows his calm beautifully expressive voice to become the central focus of this set. Bemused reflective and bewildered all at once he is a seeker who is in it for the long haul asking the kinds of questions that do not have answers.   Jim James' solo album is called Regions of Light and Sound of God. Our reviewer is Tom Moon.
