 Now your letters and okay ALL THINGS CONSIDERED cannot take all of the credit for this. But Max Hassan of Peshastin Washington has shared this extreme story with us. He writes my climbing partner and I recently returned from a great trip to the Stikine region of southeast Alaska. We brought a small silver hand-cranked powered radio that when brought on the roof to higher elevations gave us one station NPR. While climbing a new route on Mount Burkett we spent 30-plus hours huddled in a small tent testing the limits of our sanity and endurance. The radio kept us going in its own way. And so we have renamed the route the National Public Ridge. Thank you Max for that story and thanks to Alaska Public Radio for keeping you and your climbing partner sane in that tent. Many of our listeners have been inspired by our Summer Song series. Scott Reed of Virginia Beach Virginia wrote For me summer music memories begin and end with James Taylor's rendition of Carole King's You have Got a Friend. It was June 1971 and I had found my one and only true love Robin. I was a rising senior in high school moving with my navy pilot father and our family from Virginia to Rhode Island and desperate to keep this new love alive. The radio had saved us. Countless time each day that summer the song played on. We have now been married 33 years - seven children and four grandchildren. She is and always will be my best friend.  Mr.   You have got a friend.  If you have a song or a story you want to share please write to us by going to npr.org and clicking on contact us.
