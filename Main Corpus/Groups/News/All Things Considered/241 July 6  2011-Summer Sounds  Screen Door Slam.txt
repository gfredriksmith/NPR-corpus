 Time now to take a short break from the news of the world and listen to a summer sound.   I am Michael Ivey. I am a filmmaker in Westerville Ohio. My summer sound is a screen door slamming.   Before cable TV video games and texting kids in West Virginia played outside all summer long. Running inside to grab a gulp of water and running back outside happened 10 times a day. Multiply that by a bunch of kids and well there was a screen door slam echoing through the hills and valleys of Fayette County West Virginia from dawn till dusk from May to September.   Do not slam that screen door was the catch phrase of summer when I was growing up.   That was Ohio listener Michael Ivey.
