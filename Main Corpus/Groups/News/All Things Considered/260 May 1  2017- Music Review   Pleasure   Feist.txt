 After a six-year hiatus Canadian singer Feist is back. She is out with her fifth album. It is called Pleasure but that is a bit of a misdirection. Reviewer Tom Moon says the album explores the quest for inner-strength in the painful aftermath of romance.  The first thing you notice about Feist this time is the rawness.    Trying to find a way to talk about it. I am also in the mind to just let it go.  In the six years between her last album and this one Feist went through a long period of emotional distress. She is called it a dark night of the soul. It involved relationship drama a struggle to write songs.    You sent in spiders to fight for you. I was so disappointed I did not know what to do. I wish I did not miss you.  She got back on track by changing her approach. In the past she built narratives around imagined lives. This time she writes about what she is going through. She is direct blunt and inclined to keep things at an intimate scale.    I was bright as the sun then Saskatchewan then I laid low like the tide then Bay of Fundy high. I was living in extremes and everything that that means.  Feist took her music down to the bare walls. Much of this album is just guitar and her beautifully layered voice. There is lots of open space room for expressions of disarming vulnerability like on this song Baby Be Simple.    Baby be simple. Baby be simple. Be simple. Be simple with me.  It is a stunning plea wrenching in its honesty and it is just one on an album of many. Feist has not lost her gift for the insinuating melody. With pleasure she is just found striking new minimalist architecture for it.    I am not running away. Water is running like I stay - constant growing up.  The latest from Feist is called Pleasure.
