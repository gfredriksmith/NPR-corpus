That is because Guinea's national squad played Ivory Coast in Africa's premier soccer championship. NPR's Ofeibea Quist-Arcton watched the match with a group of fans.  At a ramshackle Atlantic Ocean view cubbyhole in Guinea's capital Conakry a few dozen women and men squeeze into the room breaking Ebola's cardinal rule about no contact no touching. The focus was Guinea's opening game against Ivory Coast in the Africa Cup of Nations.   The tiny room erupted in euphoria as Guinea scored and Guinea's National Elephants went ahead of Ivory Coast Elephants as the teams are called.   .  But you cannot quite get away from Ebola in Guinea. Excited fans chanted FC Ebola - i.e. Ebola Football Club adding Ebola must go.  .  And then shock - Ivory Coast scored in the 72nd minute. The Guinean fans looked deflated and the match ended in 1-1 draw. So sir Guinea was ahead.  .  Mohamed Conde says oh well we were hoping that Guinea would win but I am really proud of my team.  .  Conde says long live Guinea and out with Ebola. Ofeibea Quist-Arcton NPR News in Conakry.
