 We will take a moment now to remember a trailblazer a veteran reporter at the Los Angeles Times named Mike Penner. He died this weekend at the age of 52.  A few months later Daniels sat down with NPR's Madeleine Brand and talked about growing up as Mike Penner.  And I just felt that I kind of got a raw deal on this thing and yeah I wish I could be a girl. I really envy girls. But I did not think there was anything I could do about it. And so I just tried to make the best of - best of being Mike for a lot of years.  And when did you decide I think I am ready to change I think the time has come I no longer want to be Mike anymore?  Yeah that started bubbling up in late 2004 to the point where I was dressing at home and I was not going out and you look in the mirror. I mean for 20 years I was closeted. I would dress once a month twice a month. Then in 2004 it was starting to get to every week. It is called a gender dysphoria and it builds in transsexuals.  Christine we are born with this. We fight it as long as we can and it always wins. And I said I have to - I just have to find out about this. I do not want to die without knowing - without knowing if this is really me.
