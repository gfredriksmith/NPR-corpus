 Cyclists are doing their part to cut down on fossil fuels. And in one Spanish town the dead are also pitching in. Here's a story of a man who is brought some life to a graveyard. Mr.  My name is Esteban Serret and I work in the cemetery of Santa Coloma de Gramenet.  That is a city near Barcelona. Serret's company manages its cemetery. And a few years ago he had a vision - a dream for clean energy. Now before we tell you about that dream you need to know two things about this cemetery. First the dead are housed in above ground sepulchers. Mr.   sepulchers are called niches. They are like buildings like little buildings similar to a factory.  Similar in shape to factories with long flat roofs. The second thing you need to know about this cemetery is the weather. Mr.  Usually here in the  every day here makes a lot of sun.  So Serret's bright idea was to place solar panels almost 500 of them along the top of these tombs - generating energy that could help power the town. Well his dream is now a reality. Last November he had the panels installed in the graveyard and he says if you approach the cemetery in Santa Coloma de Gramenet from a certain direction you will now come upon a sea of shiny black waves. And Serret seems to have won over the locals. Mr.  People that have - that is owner in the cemetery tell us that it is very good to produce clean energy from their grandfather and grandmother to put the energy for the new generation.  Esteban Serret says these panels will power about 60 homes annually and that is just the beginning. Now he wants to install them on libraries sports arenas anywhere with flat sun-drenched surface. And the solar park cemetery concept might just catch on. Serret says he is been fielding calls from cities as far away as Mexico. And you can see photos of those solar panels at npr.org.
