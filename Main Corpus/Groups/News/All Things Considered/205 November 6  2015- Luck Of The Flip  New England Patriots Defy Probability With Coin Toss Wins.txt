 It is not like we needed another reason to hate the New England Patriots. There is Deflategate the fact that they always win and now this.  For the past 25 games the Patriots have won 19 of their coin tosses. Those odds defy probability even for the four-time Super Bowl champs.  Because the chance of winning that many times...  That is about half of 1 percent.  That is Steve MacEachern. He is a professor of statistics at Ohio State University. But while he says winning 19 times is unusual it is not impossible.  If we are thinking about professional football there are a lot of teams. And if instead of focusing only on the Patriots you ask what is the chance that at least one of the teams win 19 out of 25 the the probability then is of course much larger.  On the other side of the proverbial coin is losing the toss a lot. In 2011 the Cleveland Browns lost 11 in a row.  The chances of that - 1 in 2048.  Losing 11 in a row is in fact quite a feat but I think probably one of those things that just happens.  Or does it? For the Pats anyway there is been some not-quite-serious speculation that the team has somehow turned the odds in their favor.  But Steve MacEachern says the chance of winning or losing the toss will always stay at about 50-5.  Plus he says it is pretty hard to deflate a coin.
