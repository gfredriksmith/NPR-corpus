 Donald Trump who has repeatedly called the media dishonest held a wide-ranging news conference today the first since being elected president. It was also the first time we heard Trump himself acknowledge Russia's meddling in the U.S. election.   As far as hacking I think it was Russia but I think we also get hacked by other countries and other people.  Trump did leave the door open for a better relationship with Russian leader Vladimir Putin.   If Putin likes Donald Trump guess what folks? That is called an asset not a liability.  In addition Trump said he never acted in a way that would have left him vulnerable to blackmail by Russia. We will have more on that in a moment.
