 And today's last word in business is a total eclipse of the money.   Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon album that produced the classic rock staple called Money has just been bumped from the British charts by pop singer Adele's sophomore effort Twenty-One Twenty-One is now the seventh best-selling album in U.K. history. And it is well within striking distance of several more classics including Michael Jackson's Thriller. Adele is still far behind the number-one selling U.K. album though. Drum roll please. That would be Queen's Greatest Hits. But we suspect the 23-year-old Adele is rolling in the deep amounts of cash nonetheless. That is the business news here on MORNING EDITION from NPR News.
