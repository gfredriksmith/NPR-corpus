 And today's last word in business comes from a comedian. He is got his own more realistic version of the TV reality show Millionaire Matchmaker.   Meet my millionaire. I am a third generation matchmaker with an extremely high success rate.  At any event hall in Brooklyn tonight Liam McEneaney will kick off Hundredaire Matchmaker.  You know you are not meeting Mr. or Mrs. Right. You are meeting Mr. or Mrs. Right in front of you willing to talk to you.  This is for singles with mere hundreds in their bank accounts and for those who will not be turned be off when their date offers them Bud Light instead of a Chardonnay.  That is the business news on PR News. I am Steve Inskeep.
