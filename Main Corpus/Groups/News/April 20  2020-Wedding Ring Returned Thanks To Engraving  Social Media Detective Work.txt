 Good morning. I am Noel King. Three years ago a couple Mike and Lisa were eating at a restaurant in Florida when Mike's wedding ring slipped off his finger and rolled through a gap in the restaurant's patio floor. This month the restaurant decided to remodel. They pulled up the wooden flooring and a manager saw something glittering in the mud. It was Mike's ring. And thanks to an engraving with his name on it and some social media detective work he got it back.
