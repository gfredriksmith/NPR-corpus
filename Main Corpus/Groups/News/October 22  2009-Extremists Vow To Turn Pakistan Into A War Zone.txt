 NPR's Julie McCarthy joins us now from Islamabad. Hello Julie.  Hi Renee.  Tell us more about this attack on this brigadier. It sounds - at first glance it sounds rather bold and also rather easy.  And just blocks from where we are speaking to you a gunman opened fire on what is called the F-8 market. It is a crowded commercial area with sensitive offices like Islamabad's district court. It is full of diplomats embassies. The Saudis are here. And it is considered a high security zone. Yet the attacker is said to have fired on a tax office at the market and then fled in broad daylight. And this comes on the heels of the suicide bombing at the Islamic University just 48 hours ago.  And this all would be - appear to be militants retaliating for this offensive in South Waziristan. But what is the government doing to stop them? As you suggest security is not so good. I mean can the government stop them?  There is an increasingly desperate feel about the way the government is handling it. You have got sharpshooters with telescope-mounted guns who have reportedly been deployed on the rooftops of government buildings with orders to kill any terror suspect. But the Pakistanis are saying to me that the government in their eyes is failing. The schools the bazaars the mosques are under assault. And one editorial described the nation today as shell-shocked.  Well what about that offensive? What is the latest there in South Waziristan?  Yeah but what we are seeing here is you know a Taliban militancy that seems to have resilience and strength in spite of this offensive and that it is not just confined to South Waziristan or the Swat Valley. Its tentacles seem to have spread. It is popping up in all the major cities certainly here in the capital and it appears to be burrowed deep in this society and they are proving they can strike at will.  Julie thanks very much.  Thank you Renee.  NPR's Julie McCarthy speaking to us from the capital of Pakistan Islamabad.
