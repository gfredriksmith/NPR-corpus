 Let us turn from things you would like your kids to eat to things they actually want to eat. Today's last word in business is Haribo.  We are sad to report that the man who built the candy empire known as the Happy World of Haribo died yesterday. In 1945 Hans Riegel took over the gummi bear company founded by his father and transformed it from a local German candy maker to a household name recognized around the world.  Riegel regularly watched cartoons and read comic books to find inspiration for his gummi creatures. As he once said I love children they are my customers. I have to be informed about what they want to nibble. Clearly he was on to something.  And today Haribo has an estimated annual profit of 2 billion and produces 100 million gummi bears per day. Which means someone in the world is eating 100 million gummi bears per day. Because as the jingle goes kids and grownups love them so. And that is the business news on PR News. I am Steve Inskeep.
