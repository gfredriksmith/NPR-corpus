 The 25th anniversary of Hubble's launch also inspired science reporter Adam Cole and when Adam is inspired he starts singing. Here's his tribute to the telescope a parody of Iggy Azalea's Trouble.    Right I will start with the bad news. Telescopes on Earth have bad views 'ecause life gets distorted by the air and we end up with images of space that we cannot use. So we put a telescope up above the sky 350 miles high - 43 feet long 14 wide. We named it after Edwin. That is this guy.  You can see what Hubble saw and sing along with Adam on NPR's science YouTube channel Skunk Bear.    Hubble you can see so far with your cassegrain reflector and your COSTAR. It cost billions to make you but it might be worth it for the space views.  This is NPR News.
