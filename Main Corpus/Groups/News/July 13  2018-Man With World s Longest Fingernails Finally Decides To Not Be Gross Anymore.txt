 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. The man with the longest fingernails in the world decided it was finally time to cut them off. The 82-year-old man from India had been growing his nails since 1952 after a teacher laid into him for breaking one. According to the Guinness Book of World Records his nails had a combined length of 29 feet which is about half the length of a bowling lane. The nails will now be on display at Ripley's Believe It Or Not in Times Square. Do not all rush there at the same time.
