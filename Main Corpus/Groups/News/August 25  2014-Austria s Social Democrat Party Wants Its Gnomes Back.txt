 Good morning. I am David Greene. Austria's Social Democrat Party is offering over 1000 for information about their missing Gnomes. Yes Gnomes. The BBC reported that on Saturday over 400 garden gnomes were stolen from an Austrian town where they were holding election campaign signs while tied to lamp posts.  Maybe they were just wandering around David you know being nomadic.  Yeah just kind of gnoming the countryside.  This sounds like a case for Sherlock Gnome.  That was too much Steve. Later gnomies. It is MORNING EDITION.
