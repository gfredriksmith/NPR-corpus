 Now the Federal Housing Administration might need its first bailout in its 79-year history. So-called reversed mortgages are at the heart of the problem here as fallout from the housing crisis continues. NPR's Dan Bobkoff explains.  Perhaps you have seen ads like this one on TV.   FHA-insured reverse mortgages are heavily promoted as a way to live off the value of a home. The loan is generally repaid when the house is sold or the borrower dies. But if homeowners stop paying their property taxes or insurance that is considered a default and FHA takes over. That is what happened with many reverse mortgages during the financial crisis. The FHA found itself trying to unload homes that had lost a lot of value. Ed Pinto is with the American Enterprise Institute.  Well as soon as FHA takes the house their expenses go up dramatically. Now they have to pay for upkeep they have to pay for sales commissions etc.  The Federal Housing Administration may draw nearly a billion dollars from Treasury to make up for its projected shortfall. FHA Commissioner Carol Galante said in a statement that if not for the reverse mortgages the agency would actually have a 4 billion surplus at the end of the year. Julia Gordon of the Center for American Progress says that is a welcome change.  I was more surprised by the surplus in the single-family program which I think is great news.  She says the FHA needs congressional approval to overhaul the reverse mortgage system to make it less risky. The agency has until Sept. 30th to determine whether it needs to tap the treasury.
