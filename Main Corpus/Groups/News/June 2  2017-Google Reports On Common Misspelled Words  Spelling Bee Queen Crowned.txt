 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. And apparently we all have a hard time spelling some pretty basic words. According to a report from Google the most commonly misspelled words are beautiful and pneumonia which honestly is kind of hard to spell. Other tough ones - schedule tomorrow and maintenance. But you know who can probably spell all those words in her sleep? Twelve-year-old Ananya Vinay. She won the Scripps National Spelling Bee last night with the winning word marocain M-A-R-O-C-A-I-N. It is MORNING EDITION.
