 Good morning I am David Greene with this headline Hung-over Energy Secretary Wakes Up Next to Solar Panel. It is a fake story from The Onion with a doctored photo showing Secretary Steven Chu in bed with a solar panel. Chu played along. On Facebook he said he will not confirm or deny the charges but clarified his recent announcement that he is stepping down is unrelated. He even gave a plug to the energy source saying It is no surprise lots of Americans are falling in love with solar. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
