 The move follows the agreement reached earlier this month between Palestinian militant rivals Hamas and Fatah. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson was on the Egyptian side of the border and has this report.   Only a few hundred Palestinians crossed the border in Rafah on the first day it reopened. Many like Musbah Mohamed Halawin were infirm. The 55-year-old in a wheelchair was headed to Egypt for spinal surgery.    Fellow traveler Hasna el Rais says the Egyptian move returned a feeling of dignity to Palestinians.  We have the higher spirit now because this is an example of freedom and end of every suffering in the last five years. We suffered too much.  On the Gaza side Ghazi Hamad who heads the Border Crossing Authority waved aside such claims.  I think everything is working normally here. There is no smuggling no criminals no violation of law. So I think they should not be worried about this.   Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson NPR News.
