 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep. You must respect this man for his persistence - just not for his timeliness. He was determined not to miss his plane in Denver.

He told the police who stopped him that he was trying to make it to his high school reunion in Ohio. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
