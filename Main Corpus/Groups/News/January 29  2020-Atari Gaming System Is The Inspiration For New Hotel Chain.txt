 If you think elevator music is bad wait until you hear this.   That is the sound of an Atari 2600 - Frogger to be specific. And that old gaming system is the inspiration behind a new chain of hotels.  Yeah. Atari hotels are in the planning stage according to a press release. Developers want to take advantage of the gaming community in the United States and all that nostalgia for the 1980s.  Quite honestly I came up with the idea when I was watching Stranger Things in the middle of the night.  That is Napoleon Smith III who thought of this.  We are going to have a speakeasy arcade speakeasy for guys that are 40 and older to have fun. And then we are going to have an esports venue.  That of course is to attract the more modern gamer. And even the rooms will be sensitive to their needs. Napoleon Smith says no other hotel chain really caters to the video game enthusiast on the road.  A lot of gamers I have learned they have to bring their gear with them. You know no place is suited for that. So we will have the highest bandwidth these players need. We will have the screens that they need. We want to be the mecca where this whole place is designed for them to do their maximum performance and have fun with other gamers.  Smith says they will break ground on the very first Atari hotel this year in Phoenix. Seven other locations are in the works.  No word yet on whether a giant gorilla will be throwing barrels at guests from the roof which is a Donkey Kong reference for those who do not know.   Now you know.
