 Good morning. I am David Greene. The Miami Dolphins want to make sure you never have to miss another play because you were getting a beer. Thirsty fans can now have beer delivered to their stadium seats just by tweeting beerme. Do not get too excited the program is still being tested. At Sunday's game only two sections of the stadium could use it but things did seem to work well. The Dolphins hope to expand this program next season. Unfortunately they cannot use Twitter to order up a spot in the playoffs. You are listening to MORNING EDITION.
