 Good morning. I am Linda Wertheimer. It seems a Burger King in St. Louis takes their no shoes no service policy seriously. They recently asked a mother and her baby daughter to leave the restaurant because the child was barefoot. The mom tried to explain that her daughter was only six months old and does not own any shoes. Burger King has apologized for giving them the boot and has placed a side order of staff retraining. It is MORNING EDITION.
