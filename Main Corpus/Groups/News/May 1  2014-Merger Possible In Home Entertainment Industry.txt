 NPR's business news begins with another possible home entertainment merger. ATT wants to purchase the Satellite TV provider DirecTV. The Wall Street Journal first reported the news. The deal would likely be worth around 40 billion. This comes in the wake of Comcast's attempt to buy Time Warner Cable. It is still seeking government approval for the deal. Acquiring DirecTV would give ATT a national foothold in pay television as well as new platforms to deliver video on demand. The two companies already have a partnership to provide Internet service to DirecTV subscribers. Neither company is commenting.
