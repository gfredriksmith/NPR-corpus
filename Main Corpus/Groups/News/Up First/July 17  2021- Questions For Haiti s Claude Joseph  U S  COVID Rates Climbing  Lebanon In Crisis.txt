And the interim prime minister there tells me chaos in the streets does not mean no one's in charge.  I am Scott Simon.  I am Lulu Garcia-Navarro. And this is UP FIRST from NPR News.   Haiti's Claude Joseph says Haiti is at a turning point.   What really matters today is not a dynamic of power struggle. We need to put ourselves together.  Some parts of the U.S. are losing ground in the fight against coronavirus and officials say it is because there are just too few shots going into arms.  Plus an economy in free fall in Lebanon where even the middle class finds it hard to afford the basics like food.  So please stay with us. We have got the news you need to start your weekend.   Even before the assassination of President Jovenel Moise Haiti was dealing with problem upon problem - cholera statingly strong earthquake and a painfully slow recovery as well as armed street gangs and political instability.  Now officials in Port-au-Prince are trying to decide who will lead Haiti out of the chaos and political vacuum. And I spoke with one of them.  And it is an exclusive interview - nice work Lulu - with the man who is been designated as Haiti's interim prime minister right? His name is Claude Joseph. Give us some details.  Yes Scott we reached him yesterday afternoon and I asked Claude Joseph who is in charge in Haiti right now? Here's part of what he told me.   I was the one who was acting prime minister when the president died. And actually we were supposed to have someone take charge right after the death the tragic death of the president. And I was the one in charge and I assumed this role. And until now we did not have a state of chaos here easily because we were responsible enough. I am talking about the ministers and myself who were responsible enough to actually call on people for calm and working with different - with the national police and so on and so forth. But what really matters today is not a dynamic of power struggle. We need to put ourselves together.  So in other words he is saying he continued in his role as prime minister because there was an immediate vacuum in leadership but that he is actively working with the other two leaders who have a claim on the job a man named as the next prime minister Ariel Henry and the current head of the Senate a man named Joseph Lambert. He went on to say he is not interested in quote staying here where I am. But for the moment he says he is in charge.  And Lulu did he have anything more to say about the investigation into the assassination of the president?  I mean Scott there had been some speculation about his role in what happened. And I asked him point blank about that. He did say Scott that he had nothing to do with it and that the Haitian National Police are working with the FBI and Colombian intelligence and that this is obviously a very sprawling investigation. There are many characters. There was a large plot a large amount of money behind whoever organized it but they are still trying to piece it together.  President Biden of course has said that he has no plans to send U.S. troops into Haiti. Does the interim prime minister want more U.S. assistance?  He does. He says the Haitian National Police at least need help with logistics - technical support especially - in fighting gangs which are you know roving wild all over Haiti. I pressed him on whether that means a return to peacekeeping troops.   Listen I think we are at a crossroad in the country history  - I should say turning point. So we need the international community our friends to understand that this situation is not what it should be. So some help they can deem necessary with the Haitian counterparts - I think that would be very important.  But I mean it it peacekeeping troops? I mean what do you imagine when you say help? What does that look like to you?  I think that any help that can help reinforce the national police reinforce the security in Haiti right?  So that is the word from Haiti. Yet another turning point.  Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph did tell me more and we will have that Sunday morning on WEEKEND EDITION. So tune in to listen to it there or find it afterwards at npr.org   There are signs the pandemic is headed in the wrong direction as the highly contagious delta variant spreads.  Yeah cases are going up. So are hospitalizations and even deaths. CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a briefing yesterday that the trend is clear.   This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated. We are seeing outbreaks of cases in parts of the country that have low vaccination coverage because unvaccinated people are at risk.  NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin joins us. Selena thanks so much for being with us.  Good morning Scott.  So I gather numbers are going up but not necessarily everywhere.  Yeah that is right. So Walensky says it is a little bit of a mixed picture. Cases are rising in some places like California and New York that have pretty good vaccination rates. But she says by far the most spread is happening in places where not many people are vaccinated. In fact she said 97 of people who get so sick with COVID-19 that they have to be hospitalized are unvaccinated. So now numbers are not expected to get nearly as bad as they were last winter since that was before vaccines were widely available. But still officials are concerned by these numbers and point out this sickness and death is avoidable. COVID-19 is now a vaccine-preventable disease and people who have been holding out should get vaccinated.  Do scientists know why the delta variant seems to be more transmissible than the original strain?  So actually yes. I talked to virologist Angela Rasmussen about this. She is a research scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. And she pointed to a compelling preprint study out of China recently that showed people who were exposed to the delta variant got sick fast.  And on top of that when they started to test positive their viral loads were a thousand times higher than people who had been infected with a variant that had been circulating in 2020.  That suggests people infected with delta are shedding way more virus which could explain why it is so contagious. Rasmussen says the good news is that it still transmits in the same way as the original strain so all of those mitigation tools like masking and handwashing and social distancing - all of those still work to block delta. And the vaccines are still highly effective against this variant.  Does this mean that vaccinated people do not need to worry right now? CDC guidelines still say that vaccinated people for the most part do not need to wear masks. Is that correct?  Yeah that is right but I would say CDC is a bit out of step with a growing course of health experts on this front who say it does make sense to wear masks indoors if you are going out in public. This is Helen Chu. She is a professor of medicine at the University of Washington.  I would so I have not stopped asking indoors. I live with unvaccinated children. I do not want to put them in a situation where I may transmit to them.  So even though the chances of getting very sick and dying from COVID-19 are very low for vaccinated people the risk is not zero. And people can still get infected especially if there is a lot of virus circulating in their community.  Selena does it seem like the CDC might take another look at those masking guidelines right now?  Right now it does not seem so. CDC is standing firm. When asked about it at the briefing yesterday Walensky only said that in places that are hot spots where there is low vaccination rates it may make sense for local officials to consider masking requirements until the vaccine campaign can catch up. But I should say that one large county LA County made that call this very week. An indoor mask mandate for everyone including vaccinated people goes into effect at midnight tonight so we will have to see if other places follow suit.  NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin thanks so much.  Thank you.   The World Bank says the economic crisis in Lebanon is one of the worst that the world has seen in over a century. And this is happening in a country with famous tourist sites that is had a thriving middle class and legendary nightlife. It means you might see people breaking down in the grocery store with sticker shock at common items like milk or meat as inflation rises.  Or spend hours searching nearly empty pharmacies for medicines that they need to survive. NPR's Ruth Sherlock is in Beirut and joins us now. Ruth hello.  Hi Lulu.  I mean let us start with the people. Tell us what they have been saying to you.  You know it is really terrible. Yesterday we went to this Armenian Christian neighborhood that used to be thriving and we met Hasme Tabatyan. She was a home care worker but now has no regular income and she tells us anything she does earn does not go far because inflation now means everything is so expensive.  .  She is saying she cannot even afford to pay for a generator to get electricity when state power is out. And this is really one of the basics in Lebanon because state power now only works for a couple of hours a day sometimes. And it is a swelteringly hot summer here. She also says she has not made her rent payments in months and now she will be evicted by the end of July if she cannot pay. And you know this is actually really typical of the stories I have been hearing. We have also met an out-of-work chef who now collects trash for a living and a teacher who cannot make ends meet on their salary. And that is not surprising because just to give you one example baby milk now costs about a quarter of what they would earn here in a month.  A month?  Yeah.  Wow. I mean so even if people have money are there things they can buy?  Well there are shortages of many of the basics. So you see fuel lines now that are miles long and people are sitting in their cars and then getting out and pushing them by hand to get it to move forward in those lines because they do not have enough fuel. We have already talked about the power cuts. But most seriously though is the impact on the health care system. Public hospitals are shutting down because they do not have money to operate and shelves in pharmacies are sparsely stocked. I have seen people in despair because they have gone from pharmacy to pharmacy to try to find important sometimes life-saving medication and they cannot.  All right. Take us now to to the economic side of this. Why is this all happening?  Well the thing is this is sadly in many ways a preventable crisis of Lebanon's own making. The people in the government and the banking sector here either mismanaged squandered or stole cash reserves and now the state is out of money. Lebanese people are understandably furious. I spoke about this with Yasmin Masri. She became an instant celebrity here recently when a video went viral showing her shouting shame on you at a politician while he was eating in a restaurant and his bodyguards beat her up. She tells me the crisis is in a way uniting people  Because you know what actually unites people? When everybody gets poor when everybody in the same country cannot go to the bank and not have medicine cannot have water running cannot have electricity. Then everybody looking at the same you know disaster and this is when you wake up.  Lebanon is a very divided country and people used to support politicians that represent their religious sect. But now increasingly people I speak to say you know all politicians are the same. They are all part of the same corrupt political class.  So is there any help on the way from the rest of the world?  That is what Lebanese politicians want. But the international community has seen financial help here squandered in the past through incompetence and corruption. They want major reforms. But at the moment those politicians do not seem able or willing to implement these.  That is NPR's Ruth Sherlock in Beirut. Thank you very much. Thank you.
