 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. Once again we invite a fellow listener to take you on a bad trip in the segment that we call Vacation...   ...Horror Stories.  My name is Gabrielle Pascoe. I live in Hollywood California. I was working for a dotcom that kind of - well it laid off the entire staff. And so I decided to go to Thailand.   I went with a fellow member of my staff that had been laid off. We did not know each other really well.   I went with a fellow member of my staff that had been laid off. We did not know each other really well. We will call him Bob. And Bob was a really nice guy. He had a lot of charm. You know we were good travel companions. But one night he came back from the red light district in Bangkok and the next day asked me if I could get him to a clinic.   Luckily he was able to get medications that he could then bring on to the next leg of our journey which was to the south of Thailand where I had plans to go get my certification in scuba diving. Bob apparently has every intention of scoring some weed which he proceeds to do right away.   Finally I take leave of Bob on the island of Ko Tao and we go our separate ways. And from Thailand I went on to Vietnam where I spent some days traveling and then I flew to Cambodia. So I was lucky enough on that flight to meet this really nice gal. She was my age. We decided that we would go on and travel together. And we found a hotel. We kind of followed the proprietor into the hotel and he is showing us around. And he points to the toilet and he says Be sure you do not flush anything down the toilet because the plumbing is very weak here. It will just come right back up. And sort of case in point he said There is not any toilet paper there for you to even flush. He leaves. And of course I immediately pull out my roll of toilet paper. And I have my toilet paper in hand and I go to put it on the toilet paper dispenser which is there is there and what falls out of the center of the roll of toilet paper but Bob's supply.   If I flush it down the toilet as the proprietor just said it would come back up. If I put it in the greenery someone could find it and bring it to me. And like everything I knew about how Southeast Asian governments dealt with drug dealing or drug buying I knew from that Joaquin Phoenix movie where Joaquin Phoenix gets executed in the end.   So my travel partner to her it is a very easy proposition. You take it throw it into the bushes. For lack of a better way to dispose of this wad I decide that that is a reasonable thing to do. So we set out for the day and we are on our way out to see Angkor Wat. Everywhere we go there are shrines and the shrines are so lovely. And people have left incense and they have draped the Buddhas. And then as I am kind of looking at the incense and I am thinking wow you know that is an offering and offerings burn. I pull out Bob's supply from my bag and right then and there at the shrine I find the perfect place to leave it.   Gabrielle Pascoe of Hollywood California.
