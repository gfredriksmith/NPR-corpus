 Our last word in business takes us from the road to the sea.   No more runs for the Love Boat. It has made its very last. The cruise ship made famous in the 1970s and 80's TV show was know as the Pacific Princess.  In reality the ship is the MS Pacific. It served as the backdrop to all sorts of cheesy story lines.

Stubbing Julie Gopher and Isaac will live on. And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION for NPR News. I am Linda Wertheimer.  And I am Renee Montagne.
