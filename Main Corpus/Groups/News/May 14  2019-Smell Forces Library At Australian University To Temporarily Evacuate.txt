 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. The University of Canberra in Australia had a temporary scare recently. This horrible smell was emanating from the library. Staff thought it might be a gas leak so they evacuated immediately. An hour later the school sent out a message saying it was not a gas leak after all it was a durian fruit left in a garbage can which was apparently not enough to contain the odor from this infamous fruit. Smithsonian magazine described it this way - turpentine and onions garnished with a gym sock. It is MORNING EDITION.
