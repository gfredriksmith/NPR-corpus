 Now we will hear about a team of scientists who say they reached a milestone on the path to creating artificial life forms. NPR's Joe Palca has the story.  Geneticist Craig Venter thinks big. He did not hesitate to take on the federal government in the race to sequence the human genome. Now he is working on life itself. And yesterday at a news conference in Washington he was able to claim an initial success.  We are here today to announce the first synthetic cell.  The synthetic cell contains DNA Venter and his colleagues made in the laboratory. The lab-generated DNA has all the instructions for running the cell - a remarkable feat. By doing different things with that DNA Venter predicts he will be able to make cells that do useful things such as speed up vaccine production.  We think we can shorten that process quite substantially.  And create new biofuels.  We have a program with Exxon Mobile to try and develop new strains of algae that make normal gasoline and diesel fuel out of CO2.  But Venter's approach is labor-intensive. Harvard University Geneticist George Church says Venter has achieved a milestone but...  This is really the tool of one particular group. It is kind of out of the price range of everybody else.  David Rejeski says it is not a field people know much about. He is director of the Science and Technology Innovation Program at the Woodrow Wilson Center. Rejeski says when he tells people about the work they have many questions. Will this lead to bioweapons? Will there be environmental damage? Rejeski says scientists have not yet come up with a good way of explaining what they are doing and why the public should support it.  And so we leave it essentially to the mercy of the headlines and the people who are writing the headlines.  Joe Palca NPR News Washington.
