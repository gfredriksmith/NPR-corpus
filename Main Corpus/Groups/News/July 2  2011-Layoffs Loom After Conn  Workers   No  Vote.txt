 But the state's 45000 workers pretty much killed the deal. A majority approved it but that was not enough to satisfy the union's complicated voting rules. It is not the outcome people at the state capitol expected. Larry Cafero is the Republican minority leader in the House.  We were told from the very beginning by a Democratic governor - the first Democratic governor of this state in 20 years - trust me I know these guys. I am going to do it differently. I know how to speak with them. I know how to negotiate with them. I know what I am doing. He failed.  So on Thursday the last day of the fiscal year Malloy called legislators into special session and asked them again to trust him. He wanted the authority to lay off more than 6000 people to balance his budget and he got it. Still this was an unexpected outcome. Matt O'Connor is a spokesman for the umbrella organization that represents Connecticut's 15 public employee unions.  I think it did look easy from the outside. Again we had a governor that the members of our unions had gone out and worked hard to see elected and he won by a very small margin. Some would say that union members were key to his election victory. So you would think if you were observing it from outside we would come up with something and probably fairly quick.  But as the unions found out it was not that easy. And Governor Malloy said they left him with no choice.  I think there is an appreciation that the budget needs to be balanced and I anticipate that it will. I said we would balance it one way or the other and I am going to.  Some state union leaders say they are still hoping that a deal can be reached and layoffs can be avoided. But if that does not happen employees across Connecticut - from prison guards to social service workers to even three people in the governor's office - may soon be out of work.
