 And today's last word in business is Yuengling. The brewer of that beer based in Pottsville Pennsylvania is now the largest American beer maker. And if you are thinking how could Yuengling beat out all-American brews like Bud or Miller Lite? Well the maker of Budweiser Anheuser Busch is now owned by a Belgian Brazilian company and Miller Lite is part of the London-based multinational SAB Miller. New figures first sighted in the Allentown Pennsylvania Morning Call newspaper show that Yuengling shipments grew last year to about 2.5 million barrels edging out Boston beer which makes Samuel Adams. And that is the business news on MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Renee Montagne.  I am surprised we do not have Renee a reporter who is named Yuengling. That sounds like a good NPR name me.   I am George Yuengling in Boston. Actually I am Steve Inskeep.
