 Hunter Biden's memoir Beautiful Things reveals the less-than-beautiful details of his troubled life - the years of heavy drug use and the toll it took on his family including his father President Joe Biden. He told NPR's Scott Simon about coming to terms with the brutal realities of addiction and how he found his way to recovery.  My dad grabbed me and he held on to me and put me in a bear hug and just said I do not know what to do.

But that is what recovery is about is getting honest with yourself and understanding the power of that drug or the power of the addiction.
