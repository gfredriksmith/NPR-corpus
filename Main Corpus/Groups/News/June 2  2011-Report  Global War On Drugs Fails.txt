 It is MORNING EDITION from NPR News. I am Renee Montagne.  And I am Mary Louise Kelly. This week we have been reporting on the spreading influence of drug cartels in Central America. Today an international panel examining drug control policies is releasing a report that calls the global war on drugs a failure.  The report calls for leniency towards small time players in the drug world. And it urges governments to consider legalizing some drugs like marijuana. The report's authors include former presidents a prime minister and a former secretary general of the U.N. They argue that too much money is being spent on the drug war especially in Latin America and not enough is being spent on treatment.
