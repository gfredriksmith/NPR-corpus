  And today is last word in business is magic bus. Volkswagen's Microbus was an icon of the '70s and the preferred vehicle of many hippies. And that iconic van was spotted earlier this week at the Geneva Auto Show  a new version of it. Might have seemed like a hallucination. It was in fact a restyled version of the minivan which debuted in 1950 and went out of production in 1979. There have been a few changes now. The new version seats six not nine it uses an iPad as the entertainment control center and its electric. But if you think you are going to rush out and drive one you in fact are hallucinating because VW has no plans yet to put the new Microbus into production.
