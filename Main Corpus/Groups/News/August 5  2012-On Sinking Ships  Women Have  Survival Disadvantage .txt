  And now parsing the data on shipwrecks. Anyone who is ever seen Leonardo DiCaprio hustle Kate Winslet from a spectacularly sinking Titanic to safety knows that when the boat goes down it is women and children first right? Wrong. Two economists from Sweden's Uppsala University researched shipwrecks over the last three centuries they found that women and children have quote a distinct survival disadvantage compared to men. What is more captains and crew survive wrecks at a significantly higher rate than passengers. So it is back to the classic Every man for himself. Men in general have better survival chances say the study authors. Unless like poor Leo they go in for self-sacrifice. All of this data means the Titanic disaster in which women were three times more likely to survive than men is the exception and not the rule. On any other boat Kate Winslet would have been out of luck.    I got that old sinking feeling like I am going down soon.  You are listening to NPR News.
