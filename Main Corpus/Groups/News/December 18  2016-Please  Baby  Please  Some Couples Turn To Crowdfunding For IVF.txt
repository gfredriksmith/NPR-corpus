 Crowdfunding has become a popular way to finance just about anything from birthday bashes to political protests. And now you will find public pleas for something far more personal fertility treatments. Stephanie O'Neill has the story. STEPHANIE O' Greg and Julia Fry of Ithaca N.Y. were in their early 30s when they got married three years ago so they set out to start a family right away. But a year passed and nothing happened. And then six months more went by and still no baby.  So we started to do some tests to try and sort of find out what was happening with both of us. And we wound up going down the path of realizing that maybe fertility treatments were what we would need. O' They began with IUI or intrauterine insemination. That is where sperm is inserted with a catheter into the woman's uterus. They tried the procedure four times in the past year but still no luck.  This by far is the hardest thing that we have ever been through together. There is always hope going into every cycle and that hope sort of gets dashed at the end of the cycle. And then we start again. O' Now they are going to try in vitro fertilization or IVF. This involves mixing eggs with sperm in a lab then transferring the embryo into the woman's uterus. And it costs about 15000 to 20000 a pop. At first Greg says they considered traveling overseas for more affordable treatments but travel costs would have gobbled up any savings. So they decided instead to go online to the crowdfunding site GiveForward and to post an ad that begins this way.   You know us as Julia and Greg...  The couple with so much love to give.  But now we are asking for your help and love...  To start our family. O' Crowdfunding for IVF is gaining traction. GiveForward the site Greg and Julia use says in 2016 it saw a nearly 250 percent jump in the number of couples asking for IVF help making it one of the fastest growing categories on the site. Many believe that is happening because health insurance usually does not cover infertility treatments. Janet Carter and her wife Jackie live in Charleston S.C. Both Janet says have job-based health insurance.  They will cover anything that is testing beforehand like any underlying issues that are leading to the need for fertility treatment. They do not cover any of the actual procedures at all. O' So as their August 2015 wedding approached Janet says they offered their guests a chance to fund fertility treatments.  So we not only had a regular registry for Target but we also decided to you know have it be an option for our friends and family that wanted to be a part of us starting our little new family. O' The wedding guests donated about 3000 which the couple used to help pay down credit card bills for nine failed IUI attempts. And that encouraged Janet to suggest this year relaunching the campaign among a wider circle of friends to crowdfund the IVF she wanted to try next. But Jackie was not so sure.  Am I ready to do that? Am I ready for people to be that involved? O' So they asked friends and family what they thought. And Janet says the support was resounding save for a wee bit of hesitation from Janet's mom.  She just does not really agree with it necessarily and I think that is just a generational difference in opinion. O' Jackie however became convinced.  There are you know thousands of people out there using these crowdfunding sources for things that are not as impactful as you know having a child. O' The Carters went forward with a site called YouCaring that has so far netted them more than 5000. Still crowdfunding can be hard says Rachel Gurevich. She writes about fertility issues.  I would not do it unless you have a lot of social connections. I feel like a lot of people think that it is automatic - they are going to put it up and they are going to raise a bunch of money. And they are not. And that could be really disappointing. O' Indeed dozens of IVF campaigns on these sites show zero dollars raised. Greg and Julia Fry's crowdfunding efforts have earned them about 1200 so far. Julia says the support is heartening.  There are people that come up to me. They have come into my office in the last couple weeks and you know they hand me 20 and they are like please take this. We love you guys. We think you will be such great parents. Please take it. O' The Carters meanwhile are continuing crowdfunding to pay off their recent IVF attempt. And Janet Carter is now pregnant and due to give birth on June 24. For NPR News I am Stephanie O'Neill.
