 Good morning. I am David Greene. NBA star LeBron James was on the New York subway.   On our way back from shootaround - decided to take a different transportation this time.  He posted video of himself and the guy sitting next to him.   I do not know. This dude right here he trippin'.  Can you not?  .  The guy put his hand up and said can you not? He told USA Today he was not in the mood to be filmed because he had not finished his coffee yet and because of the poor lighting. He also had no idea that was LeBron. It is MORNING EDITION.
