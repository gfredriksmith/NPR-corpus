 Good morning. I am Steve Inskeep with a reminder that guns do not kill people dental floss kills people. Jail inmates in Westchester County New York have sued the county for 500 million because they want to be issued dental floss. The county is reluctant saying prisoners elsewhere have used floss as a weapon. They have also used it to escape weaving ropes out of braided floss or even using toothpaste-coated floss to cut very slowly through cell bars. It is MORNING EDITION.
