 Now to that do-it-yourself rocker we mentioned before. Australian musician Claude Hay built his own house. He customized his own touring van complete with a recording studio. He even makes his own instruments and his music is DIY as well using looping slide guitar sitar bass and electronic percussion to put a signature stamp on traditional blues laced with a healthy dose of funk.  Mr.   Want more but you got none left set fire to a treasure chest. You got money yes money to burn but do not forget. Gonna stay wanna stay for a long time. Your kids will they see sunshine. Be conscious of the things you buy but do not forget. Do not do not...  That is Do not Forget off Claude Hay's new CD Deep Fried Satisfied on Ingot Rock Records. Claude Hay and his homemade guitar made their way from Down Under to our studio at NPR West. Mr. Hay thanks a lot for making the trip and I hope your frequent flyer account is up to date.  Mr.  Yes. Oh no problem. I do not even have one actually.  Oh you better. You put in a lot of miles. Mr.  I better get on top of that.  Yeah exactly. I have to ask you though your new CD Deep Fried Satisfied comes out of your love of fried food. Mr.  Yeah.  Now wait a minute. Now I can see you know love for a woman or a place or a car as inspiration. But fried food? Mr.  I actually wrote half of that album in the U.S. about a year and a half ago. And it was just more about fun and I did eat quite a lot of junk food.  So you are not denying. Mr.  I am a bit guilty there. When I was in New York I never had New York-style pizza before and it blew my mind. I met a lot of people there and the culture behind that pizza there was fascinating. So that is kind of where it is all from.  Well it is interesting 'ecause you have led us into the first song you are going to play for us. And it is about New York pizza and it is called Get Me Some. Let us hear it Claude Hay. Mr.  OK.  Mr.   Here we are in New York City looking for a bite to eat. As my tummy starts to rumble I know exactly what it needs. I hear a pizza calling. I hear a pizza call. There is only one flavor for me. Nice base tomato paste cheese pepperoni. Oh I am gonna get me some of that. Oh I am gonna get me some. Oh I am gonna get me some of that. Oh I am gonna get me some. Oh I am gonna get me some of that. Oh I am gonna get me some. Oh I am gonna get me some of that. Oh I am gonna get me some. Oh I am gonna get me some of that. Oh I am gonna get me some. Oh I am gonna get me some of that. Oh I am gonna get me some.  That is Get Me Some performed by Claude Hay in our studio at NPR West. Claude makes me hungry for a slice.  Mr.  That is good. It is done its job.  Yeah. Now describe the instrument that you built that you are playing. Mr.  This is my little baby called Betty. It is basically a twin neck guitar which I kind of - this was made out of an old kitchen bench top which I had floating in the shed for a while. It is an old slab a piece of maple. And I just really wanted to make something that was really adaptable for looping really. This is just basically two guitar necks and one neck modified for a bass. The great thing I mean the main reason behind it is just so with looping you kind of want to get the song going as soon as possible. And this is great from switching from a bass sound to a sort of lovely acoustic tone or you can flick it over to more of electric sort of tone.  Now describe what you mean when you talk about looping. Mr.  Basically what it is is a little electronic box which is on the floor. And you plug one of your instruments in it say like a guitar or something and then you hit a button. I generally just play something for about one or two bars. Generally what I will do I will play like a bass line or a percussion line first and get the sort of rhythm section going and then whack down a bass line. You basically record it and the good thing about it is you can take the bass in and out. So if you want to bring some dynamics. I mean you can keep going. You can add - I mean I also run another - I have got a kick drum here and a snare and I have made these pedals that whack a snare drum and got another pedal that I hit for tambourine and all that sort of stuff. So you do not have to put up with smelly bass players and out-of-time drummers. You just got to learn to put up with yourself really which is hard at times.  Oh dear. So when you are on tour I mean do you carry a hammer nails a little toolkit? I mean how do you satisfy your DIY jones when you are on the road? Go buy some Legos or something? Mr.  I mean that is so funny you say that because I actually do carry a big toolbox around with me because you know seriously like in Australia you have got to do a lot of kilometers. I do about 70000 kilometers a year and the car breaks down everywhere you go. And like literally I just left Melbourne before I came here and the accelerator pedal fell off. And out comes the toolkit you know jam a screw in there just to get you going. I remember driving on the freeway trying to pull the cable out of the bottom of the car as I was driving. 'ecause it broke when I was driving and I was on this freeway. Everyone's going 110 and then I am at like 40 Ks an hour. So I just yank this cable out and I am trying to hold and put my head above the dashboard.  Well you really are a do-it-yourself guy. I mean it even extends to the fact that you wrote all the songs on this CD with one very curious exception. You did a cover of the Queen classic We Will Rock You. Let us hear that for a bit.  Mr.   Buddy you are a young man hard man shouting on the street gonna take on the world someday. You got blood on your face you are a big disgrace waving that banner all over the place saying we will we will rock you we will we will rock you.  Oh my goodness oh my goodness. Are you someone that aspires to do like arena shows or something? Mr.  No. I do not know. That is actually done on a sitar that thing. But I have always loved Queen you know and I loved their harmonies. And towards the very end of that song I do a lot of - I cut the instruments out and I bring in a vocal harmony thing. And I felt what better you know band to sort of turn inside out and do harmonies to than Queen?  Mr.   We will we will... I actually really find it hard to do a cover. I have done so many and I have never done them live 'ecause I just go oh it is terrible. You know I have really got to try and find something that I can - I would be terrible on those you know those Idol shows and all that because I would be too fussy. You know it would take me three months to find a song to do because I have to really change it before I even start to like it.  Well given the sounds and the kind of maximizing of the abilities of your instrument that filter through this entire CD on the final track it is really kind of minimal. The song Miss You So it starts sounding out like an old-time John Lomax recording of a Southern work song. Mr.  Yeah you are right.  Yeah this is what it sounds like.  Mr.   Mama I miss you so. Mama I miss you so. Mama I miss you so. Mama I miss you so. Shed a tear every time I think of you... That song is probably the most different on the whole album really. That came from a dark place. And...  Care to elaborate a bit on the dark place? I mean the title is Miss You So. Mr.  Yeah unfortunately I lost my mother last year. She died of cancer. And so that is kind of what that song's about. It is really a dedication to my mom really.  Our condolences to you. Mr.  Thank you.  You do not have a lot of good things to say about the modern world on this record. I mean you know you got a computer printer it breaks right away. You get a pristine used car you find it breaks falls apart. You are always on hold on the telephone. I mean you are really not happy with the things in the modern world. Mr.  Yeah if something really annoys me those songs come out real easy.  Yeah. Well you address some of this in the song How Can You Live With Yourself. And you are going to perform that for us now. Mr.  Oh OK. Yep.  Mr.   I got this new printer shiny as can be. The smell of plastic straight from China across the sea. You plug it in there is always something going wrong. In different color paper jam margins gone. How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live? As you guessed it is just past the warranty. Most likely a 2-cent part it will mean. But now you have to change your whole circuit board. It is going to cost you a lot more than it is worth. How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live? How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live? How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live with yourself? How can you live? How can you live? How can you live?  That is Claude Hay. His new release is called Deep Fried Satisfied on Ingot Rock Records. He joins us from NPR West. Thanks a lot and good luck on the road. Mr.  Oh thank you. Thanks so much for listening.
