 Good morning. I am Rachel Martin. If you have been on TikTok chances are you have come across WitchTok. It is a niche corner of the Internet for self-described witches who lean into astrology and worship different kinds of deities. Recently some novice witches hexed the moon and upset the whole community. A viral tweet explained it as hurting the world's cosmic energy. Do not worry though. The moon is scientifically OK and definitely will not fall out of the sky which is good because 2020 just cannot take it.
