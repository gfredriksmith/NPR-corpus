 And now another moment from today's total eclipse of the sun. Here are Carlyn  Steven  and 3-year-old Grace Meyer  in Russellville Ky.  For our 3-year-old we made a helmet. This helmet is an old Halloween mask that we put some solar filter paper in so she can just put on this helmet and look like a video game character who is protected from the sun.  I am a video game. I am a video game. C.  Oh it is like the sun is setting in every direction. This is so weird. I see - oh my God . Grace look. What does - what does that look like? What do you see?  I see a cookie. C.  It looks like a cookie ?  There was like a deep instinctual fear for like that very first instant. C.  Yeah. S.  Like something's wrong. C.  Right.  I wish I could like walk on the moon. C.  Yeah. It is so tempting to keep looking right at it but I know we cannot do that. S.  It is one of these things that people have experienced for millennia. And for most of that time we did not understand what it was. So it is like really exciting to experience this as just a novelty and not like a terrifying omen. C.  Now that we are coming out of it it is just like I am looking at the people around us and it is just like it is a new day and we have all experienced something really amazing together. And I just like cannot stop staring at people instead of the sky. This is really amazing. All right any final thoughts?  I feel like I want to be a solar eclipse.
