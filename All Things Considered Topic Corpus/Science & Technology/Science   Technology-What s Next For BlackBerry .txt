 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Melissa Block. And it is time for All Tech Considered.   We will start with our look ahead at the week in technology.  Would you want to be the CEO of BlackBerry? I do not think so.  That is NPR's Laura Sydell who says these are bad times for BlackBerry and its creator Research In Motion. The Canadian company has its shareholders' meeting in Ottawa tomorrow. You remember the BlackBerry? For years it was the handheld device that every celebrity business bigwig and even the president used to check email news whatever all the time. Its biggest fans called it the CrackBerry. Well they have kicked the habit since then big time. Research in Motion's stock has plunged 95 percent since 2008 and last quarter it lost over 500 million. New CEO Thorsten Heins took over in January. And despite the company's gloomy outlook Laura Sydell says Heins has been anything but gloomy.  And he is been walking around saying how optimistic he is about BlackBerry. And in particular he is been walking around talking about the next BlackBerry the BlackBerry 10 and how great it is going to be and saying they are going to have it out by the end of the year. And guess what? They are not going to have it out by the end of the year.  And she says that is not going to help him win over investors tomorrow.  It could be an angry crowd. I would not be surprised if he faces a very very angry crowd of people.  And shareholders might sue for misleading information if BlackBerry does not release the 10 on time. Of course Laura Sydell says there is one thing that could prevent a lawsuit.  Would you want to sue BlackBerry which there is even - this is so sad to say - the possibility that this former leader in the smartphone world could go under?  That is NPR's Laura Sydell.
