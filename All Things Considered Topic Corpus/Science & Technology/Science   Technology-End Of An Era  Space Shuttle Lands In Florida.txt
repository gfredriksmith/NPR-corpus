 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  Early this morning Space Shuttle Atlantis spent his last hours in orbit. Commander Chris Ferguson sounded relaxed as he checked in with mission control in Houston. He described the view as the ship made its fiery reentry through the Earth's atmosphere.   We are doing fantastic. How about you?  I am doing fantastic. But I wish we could share everybody - with everybody this really cool glow. It is just amazing outside.  Soon after that...   NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce reports on the end of NASA's space shuttle era.  Atlantis rolled to a halt and Commander Chris Ferguson spoke to Mission Control.  After serving the world for over 30 years the space shuttle has earned its place in history. And it is come to a final stop.  After running through the checklist eventually he was left with nothing else to do.   We understand Fergie job well done.  Commander Ferguson said the space shuttles are now headed for museums but they should still inspire future generations.  I want that picture of a young six-year-old boy looking up at a space shuttle in a museum and say you know Daddy I want to do something like that when I grow up.  Shuttle launch director Mike Leinbach said it was hard to describe the emotion.  I saw grown men had grown women cry today - tears of joy to be sure. And that was just human emotions came out on the runway today and you could not suppress them.  The shuttle job losses continue. Tomorrow over 1500 people are being laid off. But Leinbach says the workforce has something no one can take away.  When I talked to the people in-between the hugs and pats on the back the pride that they have of having been part of this amazing program this amazing event in history.
