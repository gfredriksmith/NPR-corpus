 OK Robert it is time for the two of us to talk about a pervasive threat to our online privacy.  That is right. It is time to talk about cats. Millions and millions of cat photos have been uploaded to the Internet.  Little cats.   Big cats.   Grumpy cat.   And those cat photos can reveal more than just how cute your cat is or how much time you have on your hands.  I was using Instagram like everybody and photographing you know my life.  That is Owen Mundy an associate professor from Florida State University.  And it never occurred to me that my phone was geotagging all the photographs with the location and including that information and uploading that.  The surprise drove Mundy to create the website I Know Where Your Cat Lives. He took pictures publicly shared on photo sites like Instagram and Flickr - photos tagged with the word cat.  He then used the location data embedded in those pictures to place them on a Google map. And we should say he gathered a million of these cat photos. Well every so often it is someone dressed in a catsuit.  So when you go to iknowwhereyourcatlives.com you never know what you are going to see. A different photo pops up every time you visit the site.  You get to see inside of other people's houses. You get to see their cats. And you get to see sometimes them holding their cats.  Mundy says he wants to raise awareness about online privacy and how much information we give out.  If your cat pic appears on the site you can remove it by changing the privacy settings on the original photo. Oddly for a person who created a cat website he is not a cat person. But he is coming around.  It was not when I started. I am about 50 percent of the way there now actually. That is an outcome I did not expect.  And one other surprise...  People have e-mailed him Mundy not to get their cats taken off the map but put on it.  Which goes to show you cannot herd cats but you cannot herd cat owners either.
