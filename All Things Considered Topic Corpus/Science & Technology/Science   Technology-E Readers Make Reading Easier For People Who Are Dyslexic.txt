 Here's another example of tech helping people. In this case people who struggle with dyslexia. For some the act of reading a book can be dispiriting. Just ask Matthew Schneps he directs the Laboratory for Visual Learning at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  I will open the book and I will start reading it. And then I will very quickly realize you know I am never going to get through this thing and I just give up.  But when Schneps reads on a small handheld device like a smartphone...  I am able to get through it and I am able to read it with pleasure and not the sense of dread that often accompanies my trying to read on paper.  And Schneps found he is not alone. This is not just anecdotal. Schneps has published a new study in the journal PLOS ONE. It shows that some people with dyslexia are able to read faster and comprehend more using a small eReader. What is key Schneps says is displaying fewer words on the screen - maybe just two or three per line.  It is like blinders on a horse. You are kind of limiting the distractions around you and focusing on the words you are trying to read at the moment.  Schneps cautions this will not work for all people with dyslexia. But with the ubiquity of smartphones he says testing this out is just a tap or two away.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
