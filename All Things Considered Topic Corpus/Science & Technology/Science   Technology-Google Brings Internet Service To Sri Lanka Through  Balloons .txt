 Imagine floating this idea - Internet service provided by balloons.  Well this spring if all goes well Sri Lanka will get it. Google has finished testing a system and they signed a deal with the island nation yesterday.  Thirteen balloons hanging in the stratosphere will bring the World Wide Web to the whole country.  Saman Amarasinghe is a professor at MIT. He is from Sri Lanka and he says his country has a vibrant telecom market but...  The Internet connectivity penetration is not that high. It is I think in about 16 percent range.  He says the Sri Lankan Civil War prevented the spread of Internet access to some areas until it ended in 2009.  One-third of the country was completely not accessible for any infrastructure development.  Add to that the many hills in central Sri Lanka making it tough to build cell towers.  So having a balloon solution that is high in the sky will have a much easier line of sight access to the balloons. And I think that part of the country can have a much better access to Internet.  And not only will rural students be able to download textbooks Professor Amarasinghe says fishermen will benefit.  When they go to sea they can find the market value of fish at every different port. Things like that can have an impact on everyday people's lives. And I think having access to Internet having access high-speed Internet can reaccelerate that.  So for an island like Sri Lanka full of remote towns balloon-based Internet promises to be cheaper and better for the environment.  In other words it is got a footprint that is well lighter.
