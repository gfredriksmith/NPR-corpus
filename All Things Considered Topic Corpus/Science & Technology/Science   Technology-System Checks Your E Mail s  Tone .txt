 And whatever email program you might be using it is always a good idea to keep in mind your tone. Awkward misunderstandings occur all the time over email text and instant messaging. Take it from Matt Eldridge a salesman from New Brunswick in Canada.  I was great at over the phone or face to face but when it came to emails I would come across as aggressive or pushy or harsh.  And nobody likes a pushy salesman. So Eldridge came up with the idea for a computer program that works like spell check for emotions. It is called ToneCheck and it was released last week. ToneCheck works with Microsoft Outlook scanning emails for potential problems.   You misunderstood  You misunderstand. You know the literal meaning is the same. But emotionally I mean it makes you feel different.  According to ToneCheck at least you misunderstood might humiliate someone whereas you misunderstand simply conveys sadness. Real human beings are behind these descriptions. Anyone can go to the site and rate sample phrases on a scale from zero to 10. The site pays five cents per rating. Though the writing tips are delivered through a computer program Eldridge insists he is not trying to make people sound like robots.  The point of it is not to stifle individuality it is to help you use a little bit of common sense and to assist you in making sure that you are portraying the intended tone that you want.  Common sense also suggests not writing an email when you are angry period. No exclamation points and no need for all caps. Take a pause take a deep breath before you hit the send button.
