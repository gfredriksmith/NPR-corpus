 So that is health care and semantics with the choice of one word. We had a two-word view on health care from a certain Republican South Carolina congressman this week and now we move to three words. This week a Web site called FiLife.com launched a Twitter contest to reduce policy on how to fix health care to a mere three words. Some entries so far...  Promote Healthy Living and Eat an Apple are two examples.  Another entry focuses on Americans' eating habits.  Stop Eating McDonald's it proclaims. Still other three-word entries target our bureaucracy - among them...  Cut Red Tape No More Lobbyists.  There are some actual strategies for changing the way medical needs are met  Allow More Competition Cap Medical Malpractice More Affordable Medication Same For All and Make it Universal.  Then comes some entries from people against a health care overhaul.  Quit Being Wusses and Leave It Alone.   Doctors Make Less and Cuban Health Care. We asked for some more three-word health policy statements from people with an interest in the topic. First from the president of the American Medical Association Dr. James Rohack. Dr.   Quality Affordable Coverage. Mr.  This is Wendell Potter. I am senior fellow on health care at the Center for Media and Democracy and a former health insurance executive. My three-word solution is American Health Security. Mr.  I am Rob Farley. I am a reporter with PolitiFact.com. Does not Kill Granny.  Three-word summaries of the health care debate. The FiLife contest closes September 16th. Five winners will be announced and they will each get a 100 prize.
