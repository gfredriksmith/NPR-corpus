 On All Tech Considered we care how modern gadgets affect us as humans. So we want to hear from you about your relationship with technology specifically your mobile phone. So tell us this  when did you realize your cellphone was indispensable?  A moment where I could not live without my phone. It was like something was going on with the network or something and my phone was not working. I am like what is happening? I literally almost died.  I would even write a paper on my phone. And when my phone was off I could not write my papers. I kind of felt lost.  You could tell us a story like Ryan Matthews there and before that Kristina Andrews. Or if you prefer tell us about a moment when you wish you did not have a cellphone.  I went on a cruise and I did not have my cellphone for 10 days and it was really nice actually.  When I am sleeping and it goes off all the time.  Last weekend my cellphone broke and I spent all of last week without one and I was thinking about how pleasant it was.  I get myself caught up in situations with different female acquaintances and the phone always tell on me.  That is Broderick Foss Brett Sutton Kayla Prince and Mike Ginsberg back out on the street here in Washington offering their thoughts. Now it is your turn.
