 Corpse flowers are rare gigantic and disgusting. NPR's Will Huntsberry caught one in bloom at the U.S. Botanic Garden in Washington D.C. last night.  It is 9 p.m. but this line is insane. It in fact snakes around an entire city block. So Mike can you just tell me like what are we doing here? What is going on?  We are waiting in line to see - hopefully see the corpse flower.  Why would anyone want to see something called a corpse flower do you think? M.  Part of it I think has to do with the smell.  That and it barely ever blooms so it is sort of a rare thing too.  Meet Mike Van Kampen and son Jonah a corpse flower enthusiast. J.  Regular flowers - they have like nice smells because that is what bees like. This one goes for what flies like which is the smell of corpse.  Mike and Jonah have tried and failed to see a corpse flower two other times. They only bloom about once a decade and then only for a day or two. This one looks a lot like a seven-foot-tall peace lily. Fast forward an hour. Oh my God you made it. J.  Yeah we got in. And it smells like garbage.  Kind of peppery garbage mixed in with a few dirty diapers. The Van Kampens were thrilled they finally got to see it even though the smell was past its peak.  Not like decomp.  No.  Jacquelyn Wright was not impressed. She and Mary Stanley - they are death investigators at a local medical examiner's office.  We were pretty excited to actually compare...  The smell .  ...The actual smell of a dead body to this supposed corpse flower.  Their verdict?  Definitely not comparable.  But hey it is still a seven-foot flower that blooms once a decade.
