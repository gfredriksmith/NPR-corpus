 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West and we are going to pump you up. A study out this week finds that music with a heavy baseline makes people feel more powerful. It is the secret behind pump up songs. Adam Galinsky is one of the study's authors. He explained how the experiment worked.  We had a number of different individuals listen to a variety of different songs and we just asked them to rate how much did that song make you feel power? And then what we did in our study is we just took three songs that were rated as making people feel the most powerful - We Will Rock You by Queen Get Ready For This 2 Unlimited In The Club 50 Cent.  50   Go shorty it is your birthday. We going to party like it is your birthday.  And three songs that people rated as making them feel the least powerful - Because We Can by Fatboy Slim We Let The Dogs Out by Baha Men and Big Poppa Notorious B.I.G.  OK. So then you asked people in the study to do tasks while they listened to either the high power songs or the low-power songs. What sort of things were they doing?  So here's one of the tasks we did. People come in and they have an opportunity to roll a die. And if they get the number they yell out before the die gets rolled they get 5. So they are highly motivated they want to win you know they want to get the right number. But we give them a choice - do you want to roll the die yourself or do you want the experimenter to roll the die? And what we find is usually you know a little bit more than 50 percent of people want to roll the die themselves but in our case when people listen to high-powered music they wanted to roll the die themselves 86 percent of the time. And so what you can see here is it is making people sort of more action oriented.  50   My money on my mind. Got a mil out the deal and I am still in the grind.  Is there a way to correct for other influences like how do you know it is not the lyrics or the volume or something else?   Yeah. We can control for the amount of volume for example in the headsets and we match those all perfectly. We also then pretested the lyrics to make sure that just reading the lyrics did not make people feel more powerful. What we did in our final study is we said well can we isolate the bass sound? Because deep voices tend to be associated with power. And we know that bigger stronger bodies tend to produce deeper voices and so what we did and we took a piece of music that no one had ever heard before. And was simply manipulated the amount of bass that was in the music. And what we found was that when the song had higher bass in the music that actually made them feel more powerful.  You basically just cranked up the bass knob for the same song?  Yeah basically just cranked up the bass knob.   What does feeling more powerful do for you? Do you do better at certain things? Do you have more energy and stamina?  Yeah. I think I mean all those things. People who have been made to feel more powerful can endure more pain. We have shown that if you prime people to think about power before they walk into an interview they are like more than twice as likely to get these or business school applications - but get selected into the business school than if they had thought about a time when they had low-power. I think music is a really interesting one because music can not only make you feel you powerful but make the whole group feel powerful.  So individual application might be listen to Skrillex or some dub step before a big job interview?  Yeah. One of the things I think is what you want to do as an individual was find the piece of music that makes you feel powerful. It may be music that helps you do this it may be the superwoman pose. You want to find the thing that works for you. But there is something out there that can work for everyone.  Adam Galinsky is a psychologist at Columbia Business School. He and Dennis Hsu have just published a study showing that heavy baselines and music make people feel more powerful. Adam thank you.  Thank you so much.   Tell us what makes you feel powerful.
