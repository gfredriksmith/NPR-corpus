 Now from tech across the globe to tech at your fingertips. It is time for our latest app review. Today we are going to tell you about Figure created by the company Propellerhead. Figure is a music-making app that lets you record and layer your own beats no talent required just the right hardware and 99 cents. Lucky for us singer-songwriter Margot MacDonald has all three and shares this review.  Figure is a really intuitive way to kind of create your own music with a bunch of given set sounds of drums...   ...and bass...   ...and a lead line.   So you scroll through and you pick the drum kit you want to use. Let us say you pick Old-School and it gives you boing...   ...cha...   ...and pu-pu...   ...and create your own rhythm on the touch screen with your fingers.   Hit record and loop that then move on to the base.   Just scroll your finger up and down depending on what note you wanted to hit.   I am not sure how it could be applied live or in an actual music setting but it is definitely - for musicians it is definitely fun for playing around with some new musical ideas kind of finding inspiration in an odd source. And for the average person it is - I think it is as fun as any other game app. So that is  you are going to create something.   That is singer-songwriter Margot MacDonald reviewing the music-making app called Figure.
