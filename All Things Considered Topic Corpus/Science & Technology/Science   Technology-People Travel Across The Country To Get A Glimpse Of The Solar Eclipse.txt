 Americans gathered in cities towns and remote campsites across the country today to witness the Great American Eclipse among them many NPR listeners including a few who kept a sort of audio diary of the moment of totality the moment the moon passed directly in front of the sun.  Greetings from Cottontown Tenn. My name is Amanda Bentley Brymer  and right now I am staring up at this sliver of sun. I can really sense the difference. It is not like a cloud passing over.  Wow it is gone from dusk...  .  ...To night. Holy Moses.   Oh my gosh.  Oh my God.  I am shaking. You know the whole reason we are here was just to press reset. This moment - I thought it would feel longer. And now it feels like it is 4 oclock in the afternoon again.
