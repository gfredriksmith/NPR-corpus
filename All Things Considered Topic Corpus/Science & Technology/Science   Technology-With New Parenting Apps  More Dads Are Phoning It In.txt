 Support for new dads comes in many forms - family friends books and oh yes there is an app for that - several actually. One of the latest is designed by a clueless dad for other dads - could be...  Prince William future King of England or David Beckham international footballer or a bald bloke called Dave.  That is Dave Burton. Yes he is bald. He is also the creator of Quick Tips for New Dads. And since he is British the app he refers to nappies not diapers. His app also covers feeding bathing crying - we assume he is talking about the baby - sleep deprivation - that would be yours - and bonding. It is something Burton wishes he would had at his fingertips a couple of years ago when he was a brand-new dad.  We are all stripped-back to that raw basic human nature of we have got children in there is poo and there is pee and there is weird stuff going on. An we are all on a level playing field.  Handy as the app may be Dave Burton will be the first to admit that it is no substitute for real life experience.  You have to wait for the baby to arrive to adapt and survive really and kind of muddle your way through the best you can.  And as far as we know there is no app for that.
