 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Thirteen thousand cartographers geographers social scientists and city planners descended on San Diego last week for a conference on digital mapping. They create and use sophisticated mapping technology for all manner of things these days to respond to emergencies improve mass transit services chart rates of disease in communities. The children of the conference attendees were also in on the learning experience as Lisa Napoli reports.  Ballroom D looks like any other windowless ballroom in any other convention hotel...   ...except for the fact that it is tricked out with giant cardboard cutouts of cartoon forests and animals and flat-panel computer screens. Welcome to high-tech geography camp. Ms.  We are making a map to show where there is suitable pastures for cattle and sheep...  For cattle and sheep. Ms.  ...to go and graze and live when there is an emergency.   drawing a digital map to show which parts of the San Juan National Forest in Colorado are safe for grazing animals. This software is a version of what her father an environmental research scientist uses in his work. Making a digital map the class leaders say is like making a sandwich -a layering of pictures and data. Instructor Colin Childs says while children grow up today with GPS in the car they need to learn how those maps get made. Mr.  It is our job to try and build the connection between what they use these days together with what they should know about map reading and about the - the kind of doing analysis and stuff and asking questions.  This is fifth grader Kovid Tallum's second year at camp. His favorite aspect of this map-making process is personalizing it. Mr.  For me most of all what I like is the legend. You get to change everything on the map with - just one color can change the whole map.  After a snack break  to reconstruct Mount St. Helens before its eruption. Using 3-D mapping technology and a worksheet they build out the layers of the volcano. Soon all the computer screens are lighting up bright orange and yellow and green and everyone's virtually navigating the digital mountain landscape with their mouse. Mr.  Oh so that would be the - this would be the forest and that would be the  river.  Mm-hmm. Mr.  Okay. Now we can see the actual elevations here. Oh so that would be the lowest of what they are seeing. This little strip of yellow over here is the second lowest.  Waiting in the wings for his sons is Jason Duke. He is a geographer with the Fish and Wildlife Service in Tennessee. Here at the conference he is presented maps he is made using this kind of technology to chart the fate of birds affected by the spill in the Gulf. He said the disaster is the perfect reason for his kids to learn what he does and why maps are so important. Mr.  Everything now is so visual. Everything has a map - from MapQuest to Google Maps to all the maps we are producing with this software for the oil spill. And of course you can show your children a lot but they always believe you more when it comes from someone else.  And maybe they respect you more too. Here's Duke's 9-year-old son Carter.  Now I know why he is so tired when he gets home.   For NPR News I am Lisa Napoli.
