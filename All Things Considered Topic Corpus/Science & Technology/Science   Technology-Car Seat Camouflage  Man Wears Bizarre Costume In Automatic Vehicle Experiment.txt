 Now a mystery solved in Arlington Va. It starts with an unmarked Ford passenger van making its way through suburban streets with an apparently empty driver's seat. Adam Tuss of NBC Washington was on the case.   Brother who are you? What are you doing? I am with the news Dude. Can you pull over and we can talk for a second?  Tuss uncovered that the empty car was not what it seemed. That got the attention of Wired reporter Aarian Marshall.  There is a person inside the car but that person is dressed as a car seat.  Someone covered from head to waist in what looks like car seat upholstery.  The only clues that it is not a car seat are the hands sticking out from the costume holding the steering wheel.  It turns out it is all in the name of science. The reporters learned it was part of a study by the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute about self-driving vehicles.  So scientists want to figure out how people react to these vehicles when there is absolutely no one behind the wheel when there is no one inside. So that is why they put out these strange car seat costume studies into the field.  The researcher who pioneered the concept Wendy Ju at Stanford's Center for Design Research says she got the idea from a prank video.  There is this wonderful YouTube video that shows a person driving through drive-throughs in a car seat costume and just scaring the bejesus out of poor fast food workers.   I built this car seat costume. I am going to put it on and I am going to go through a drive-through.  Hello. Oh my God .  Hello. Are you serious?  Interesting. All right empty car can I have 1.43 please?  What the hell? I do not like this.  Those videos are from 2013 but the idea of driverless cars is still going to take some time to get used to.
