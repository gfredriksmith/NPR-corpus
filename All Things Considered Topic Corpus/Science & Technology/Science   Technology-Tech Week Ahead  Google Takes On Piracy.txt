 It is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Audie Cornish.  I am Melissa Block. And it is time now for All Tech Considered.   As of this week anyone going to search for songs or films on pirate Web sites is going to have to look a little harder. Google has changes its algorithm to lower the rankings of those sites. NPR's Laura Sydell joins me now to explain. Laura what exactly is Google doing here?  Well in a blog post the comp adds they would start to take into account the number of valid copyright removal notices they have received for given sites. So that means if you are a site that is basically all about finding unauthorized copies of movies and music you are going to appear much lower in the search results.  And have they been under pressure to do this?  Yes they have. The big media companies the record labels the film companies have all been really upset about the amount of piracy. And they keep saying to the search engines why do not you do something. And the search engines have always said you  we are just here to rank things and we do not want to get involved in this. But this is a way for Google to do it and to just sort of feature it into the search results.  Laura I would think that one of the sites that gets a lot of these copyright removal notices that you talked about would be YouTube. Is that going to be effected by what Google is doing here?  Indeed they do get a lot of copyright notices. And I am sure Facebook and Twitter and other big sites do as well. But they will be effected. And I think it is largely because they have so much legitimate traffics. So Google has said that those sites will not get lower in the search rankings. Though because Google actually owns YouTube that is probably very convenient for Google.   OK NPR's Laura Sydell thanks so much.  You are welcome.
