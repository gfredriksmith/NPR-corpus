 Today a Russian billionaire investor announced he is giving a portion of his wealth to the search for extraterrestrial life. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel reports.  If E.T. ever did give us a call it probably sounds something like this.   That is from the 1997 film Contact in which aliens use radio waves to send a simple mathematical signal.    Two three five seven - those are all prime numbers and there is no way that is a natural phenomenon.   Holy...   OK let us just calm down and pull up the star file on Vega...  In real life the search for extraterrestrial intelligence - or SETI as the pros call it - has struggled.  The real difficulty with SETI has not been so much the search - it is been the fundraising.  Seth Shostak is at the nonprofit SETI Institute in Mountain View Calif. Congress canceled NASA's search in 1993. Since then private funding to institutes like his have just barely kept things going. Then this morning Yuri Milner a Russian mogul who is made billions through investments like Facebook announced a hundred million for a new 10-year search. Milner's funding it through his own program called the Breakthrough Initiatives. Shostak is not directly involved but he says it should be a game changer.  They are hoping to observe at a least a million star systems. Now to put that in perspective the total number of star systems that have been looked at by all SETI experiments over the course of the last half-century it is a few thousand. Obviously this is a tremendous improvement.  Shostak says there is still no guarantee of hearing anything but as of today the odds are just a little better. Geoff Brumfiel NPR News.
