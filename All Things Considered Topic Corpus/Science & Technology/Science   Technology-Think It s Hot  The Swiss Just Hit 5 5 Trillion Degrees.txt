 We talked earlier about how hot it is in the summer. But that is nothing when compared to some really sizzling heat we heard about today.  Of all places it happened in Switzerland at CERN in the large Hadron collider for a tiny fraction of a second. So how hot was it?  It was something more than five trillion degrees.  That is Paolo Giubellino a physicist with the project. Yesterday CERN scientists said it is the hottest man-made temperature ever received.  You can imagine that that may be more than 100000 times hotter than at the center of the sun.  Actually no I cannot imagine it.  And I am not even going to try.
