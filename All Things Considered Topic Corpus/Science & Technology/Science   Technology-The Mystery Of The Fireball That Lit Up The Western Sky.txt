 Last night a bright fireball with a long tail streaked across the sky in the western part of the U.S. You could see it from San Diego Las Vegas Salt Lake City and places in between.  Whoa.  .  Whoa.  Dude .  That is a video from Utah one of many that were posted online. Everyone was asking - what was that - a meteor or falling space junk? Well NPR's Nell Greenfieldboyce has the answer.  Jonathan McDowell heard about the fireball a few minutes after it happened. He is an astronomer at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge Mass. And he immediately checked to see if any low-orbit satellites were expected to re-enter the earth's atmosphere about that time.  Very quickly I spotted that this large Chinese rocket stage was on the verge of re-entry.  And yep the fireball was this returning Chinese rocket. That was confirmed today by the U.S. Strategic Command. It had been tracking the rocket since it launched last month. Now hunks of falling space junk burn up all the time but this one was pretty big - more than 30 feet long.  The only bigger event this year was a Russian rocket stage that re-entered over Vietnam on New Year's Day.  McDowell says it is just luck that this one came down when and where so many people could see it. And while it is possible a few small pieces of metal might have survived to hit the ground somewhere he says there was no real danger to people. It was just a pretty show.
