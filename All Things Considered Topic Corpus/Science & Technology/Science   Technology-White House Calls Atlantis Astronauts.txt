 The astronauts aboard the space shuttle Atlantis received a special call today.  Hello Mr. President. You are talking to the Increment 28 crew and the crew of the space shuttle Atlantis.  Oh that is funny see because I was just dialing out for pizza.  Houston we have in order. President Obama phoned the Atlantis crew along with the crew of the International Space Station.  And all joking aside Mr. Obama thanked the astronauts for their hard work. He said their mission marks a new era of pushing the limits of space exploration ultimately working toward a trip to Mars.  And back to the jokes the president offered his sympathies when one of the astronauts said they would all become a big family in a short amount of time.  You need to be like a family 'ecause I am assuming you have to share pretty cramped quarters and a bathroom. So you know my wife and my daughters are always crowding me out.  But shuttle Commander Chris Ferguson assured the president that as far as the rest of the universe is concerned the accommodations really are not so bad.  We actually have three bathrooms on board. And we have a gym. We have several bedrooms. It is probably one of the more spacious homes that there is outside of planet Earth.  And what have a view.
