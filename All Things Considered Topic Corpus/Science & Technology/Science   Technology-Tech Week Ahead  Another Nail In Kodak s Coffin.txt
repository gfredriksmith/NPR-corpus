 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  And I am Melissa Block and it is time now for All Tech Considered.   In this week's Look Ahead with NPR's Laura Sydell another nail in the coffin for Kodak.  You know I feel like you should bring on the violins for that one.  Cue the sad music.   Today begins this very sad process. It is really the end of an era.  The Kodak era. The company filed for bankruptcy back in January. The news today is that Kodak will begin to transfer five billion of its customers' online photos to the company Shutterfly.  And all of those Kodak customers those 68 million U.S. and Canadian customers will no longer be customers of Kodak. They will be customers of Shutterfly.  Now Kodak customers will not be able to access their photos for a while but users will eventually get them all back. As for the company well it will always be remembered for its yellow boxes of film Brownie and Instamatic cameras and as you might recall from a popular scene in Mad Men a certain slide projector.    It is called a Carousel. It let us us travel the way a child travels round and round and back home again to a place where we know we are loved.  Kodak stopped making projectors in 2004. And that look back to Kodak's glory days is our Look Ahead to this week's tech news with NPR's Laura Sydell.
