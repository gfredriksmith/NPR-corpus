 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. When you fall in love with science ordinary everyday stuff can suddenly seem extraordinary. That is how NPR blog or an astrophysicist Adam Frank sees it.  the mail the kids' toys the mess on your desk the constant daily chaos. Adam Frank says it is all just the universe having its way with your life.  Listen it is OK. You are not alone. We are all struggling and we are all doomed to fail. You see it is not just us. It is a law of physics. The hard truth is that the universe itself is dead-set against our long-term efforts to bring order to the chaos in our lives. That is because the universe loves chaos. Think about your desk. You tidy it up. It slides into a mess. Tidy it up again and still two weeks later the mess is back. That is because the deepest of deep cosmic principles is playing itself out right there in the midst of your pens paper clips and paperwork. All those unruly piles of bills you need to pay all those unfiled insurance forms falling on the floor all those birthday cards you meant to send like you know the one for Aunt Sophie you bought four months ago - they are chaos. They are disorder. And for physicists  entropy. Scientists first uncovered the laws of entropy back in the 1800s. Trying to squeeze the maximum efficiency from their shiny new steam engines they discovered a radical and somewhat depressing new cosmic principle. Taken as a whole they found the universe always moves from order to disorder from low entropy to higher entropy. So while you might be able to reduce chaos in one small location like your desk the very work you do creates more mess for the rest of the universe. Think about what happens when you finally give up on sending Aunt Sophie her birthday card and toss it out. Even if you recycle it it goes back into the universe and the universe's total disorder goes up. Now think about your body's cells. The moment-to-moment effort of doing their work purging your body of waste and maintaining its functions that is life creating an astonishing island of order in the midst of chaos. But it cannot last. The cosmic demand for increasing entropy is why in time those cells have to cash in their chips. This universal law of entropy increases why our bodies and our lives have to you know end. But the news is not all bad. Yes your efforts to tidy up that desk are doomed to a kind of ultimate failure. But what you can see now is the very act of trying is what defines being alive. Even more it is that act of trying that makes life - your life in particular - a cosmic victory. Life you see is the triumph of order over chaos. Life is order hammered out if only for a time. And with that effort something new  creativity. We and all of life are always changing always evolving always experiencing one gloriously unfolding moment to the next. By beating back the cosmic tide of disorder you can write songs of praise. You can bake loaves of bread for the ones you love. You can make the light of meaning rise from the dark oceans of chaos that surround us. Sure. Life may not last forever but while it does it is surely worth the effort. So what the heck? Go clean that desk. I like to imagine that even the universe itself is grateful.  Adam Frank teaches physics at the University of Rochester and he blogs for us at npr.org. His most recent book is called  Cosmology and Culture at the Twilight of the Big Bang.
