 If you are female a new study declares that you are more likely to remember something said by this voice...  Take it off. Baby take it all off.  ...and this one.   .  And especially this one...  This is NPR.  ...than by this one.   I do not want my heart to show.  That is because the first three male voices were low-pitched. A team of researchers at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland has determined that females better remember what deep-voiced men say than things said by a man with a higher pitch.  And the point to the research was to show that women's memory is sensitive to details associated with men who are desirable.  That is Dr. Kevin Allan. His department conducted the study. He says science already knew that the ladies preferred deep-voiced guys.  But the Aberdeen study for the first time connected voice pitch with memory. The study was done by showing a group of women various objects while hearing men say the name of the object. The deeper the voice of the man the more likely the women would recall it.  Now they did test men too but Lynn apparently male memories are not sensitive to the pitch of a female voice.  Well that is good to know.
