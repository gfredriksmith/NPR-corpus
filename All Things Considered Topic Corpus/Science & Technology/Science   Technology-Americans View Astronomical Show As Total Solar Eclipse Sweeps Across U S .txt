 Hello this is Kevin Bunch . I was in Lebanon Tenn. for the eclipse came down here to get married.  NPR listeners are sharing their stories of the eclipse today.  My partner she asked me if I wanted to get married under this eclipse. So we came out here after planning for a couple of years. And we got our parents out here and our siblings. And I have always wanted to see one of these things 'ecause I have always been kind of a space nerd. You know I did not get the chance to see a partial eclipse when I was a kid 'ecause they kept us all in the school so I was really interested in seeing this one for years. And oh it was amazing. Like the - one of the most amazing days in my life on many counts.
