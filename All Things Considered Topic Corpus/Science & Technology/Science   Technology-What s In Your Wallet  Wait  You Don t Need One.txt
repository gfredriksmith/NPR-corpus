 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. When you go to the store chances are you pay with plastic or cash. But dozens of enormous companies from Starbucks to Wal-Mart  your phone. NPR's Steve Henn explains why so many firms are so eager to replace wallets and cash registers.  Omar Green is the director of strategic mobile initiatives at Intuit. Intuit owns the little personal finance website Mint. It makes TurboTax and Quicken. And recently it is been selling a little attachment for a smartphone called GoPayment that lets almost anyone anywhere accept a credit card.  It became very obvious to me that there was a grand sea change in the payment space when the Girls Scouts started using Intuit is GoPayment.  So like a couple of Girl Scouts?  Oh it was like one Girl Scout troop was using GoPayment and...  Did they just totally clean up?  They just - boom. I mean it was crazy how much money these little girls were bringing in with Girl Scout cookies. And so it hits me oh my God we have got little 8-year-old girls who are now not just consumers but merchants. And so the next year we went after the Girls Scouts like in a major way.  Five years ago getting set up to accept credit cards was a big giant hassle. You needed to get something called a merchant account a special machine and then there was a tangle of fees you were charged by banks and card processors.  It is time to rethink these models.  Jack Dorsey is best known as one of the co-founders of Twitter but his other company Square has blazed new ground in mobile payments. It developed one of the first little plug-in fobs that transformed a smartphone into a tiny little cash register. And it is created an app that lets consumers pay for products like my favorite ice cream - could I get Bacio - at participating stores simply by walking up to the counter and saying your name.  Your name came up. Stephen Henn?  Steve Henn. Even though only about 10 percent of the American public has ever used an app like this the mobile payment space is getting crowded.  God. It is huge.  Omar Green.  Everybody who thinks they can build you a mobile banking solution is building you a mobile banking solution.  Google PayPal Visa MasterCard ATT Verizon T-Mobile and Sprint just to name a few. And yesterday more than a dozen of the nation's biggest retailers announced they are joining forces to build their own mobile payment network.  Wal-Mart and Target are among those.  Jeremy Mullman is a spokesperson for the group called MCX.  Sears CVS Lowe's Best Buy Publix 7-Eleven.  These companies have more than 1 trillion in sales and pay billions of dollars in payment fees.  We think that if you have a common set of standards in mobile commerce you can eliminate a lot of those costs and that is obviously you know that is very important.  And with so much competition right now to build a digital wallet there are some signs that payment fees for merchants could actually fall. Today Jack Dorsey at Square announced a new plan for small businesses that would fix monthly fees they pay for credit card and mobile purchases at 275.  We want to focus with this on small businesses so we wanted to make it even simpler.  And cheaper for merchants. But some think digital wallets will never really take off until there is something serious in it for consumers too. Steve Henn NPR News San Francisco.
