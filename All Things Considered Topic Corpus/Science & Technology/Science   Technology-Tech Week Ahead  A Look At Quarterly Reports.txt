 It is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Audie Cornish.  I am Robert Siegel. And it is time now for All Tech Considered.   Steve Henn joins us now from Silicon Valley. And Steve what stories will you be following this week?  Well its earnings week on Wall Street and a couple big companies based here will release their quarterly reports including Facebook. Facebook will report its results for the first time ever as a public company on Thursday. Now Facebook's initial public offering preformed fairly poorly. Its stock has lost close to a third of its value since it began trading. And this earnings report will give all of us our first glimpse of whether or not the company is on track to turn that around.  And we will be watching this week. Thank you Steve.  My pleasure.  That is NPR's Steve Henn in Silicon Valley.
