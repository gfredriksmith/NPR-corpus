 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  I am Melissa Block. And it is time now for All Tech Considered.   And first our tech news look ahead with NPR's Steve Henn who joins me from Silicon Valley. Steve what is on your mind?  Melissa I was planning to talk all about cars today. But last night in China there was a riot at a Foxconn plant. It was big. Reportedly 2000 employees were involved 5000 police were called in 40 people were injured. Workers told reporters in China it was set off when a security guard allegedly beat an employee there. Now this plant reportedly makes Apple products including the new iPhone. I reached out to Apple today for a comment and have not heard back. Earlier this year Apple asked an outside group the Fair Labor Association to investigate working conditions at Foxconn plants. The FLA did not inspect this plant and it is unclear right now if they have any plans to go in. Foxconn said today it will be investigating. And clearly you know what happened there is going to garner a lot of attention over the next week.  OK. And we will be checking that.
