 We have been talking occasionally with inventors about what inspired their creations. Today a computer scientist in Cambridge Massachusetts. Fifty-one years ago one of the first digital video games was born out of his imagination.  My name is Steve Russell sometimes known as Slug. In 1961 I was working for the MIT Artificial Intelligence Project and a new computer got given to MIT by its maker the Digital Equipment Corporation. And it was all transistorized so it was relatively reliable and it had a CRT display on it. CRT is the initials for cathode ray tube the tube that was used before flat panels came for television. And it was also developed a lot in World War II for radar. So I thought this was interesting and a couple of things made it even more interesting. One was Professor Marvin Minsky had written a little program that displayed three spots on the screen and they influenced each other and generated a sort of kaleidoscope display. It was interesting for an hour or two but after a while you realize that eventually everything decayed into a random pattern. So I started talking up the idea that a better demonstration was needed. And the space race was very much in the news at the time. And so I started talking up the idea of a spaceship trainer that would teach people how to fly a spaceship. And what I got going was a display which showed two spaceships on the screen and it had some random stars in the background. To add a little motivation to learning how to fly a spaceship we added torpedoes and we consciously designed it to be a game. We called it Space War! And when everything got working I decided that was pretty good so I added an exclamation point.  That is Steve Russell creator of Space War! an early digital video game. It premiered for the public at the 1962 Science Open House at MIT.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
