 We like to think all stories are equal. But our astrophysicist thinks we did not make a big-enough deal of what he thinks is a story so important it gives him chills. So here's last week's news through the misty eyes of NPR blogger Adam Frank.  Now you may have heard the news. But did you really hear the news? Recently astronomers announced they found a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri the star closest to the sun. Turns out we have got a neighbor. And that is a big deal. See most of the stars are so far away that even with a hyper rocket traveling close to light speed it would still take millennia to reach them - but not Proxima Centauri. Just 4 light years away our hypothetical hyper rocket could get there in less than a human lifetime. That is why a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri has been a science fiction obsession for like ever. The Proxima planet is so close that extreme telescopes we are building right now may give us an unprecedented first-of-a-lifetime view of an alien world. Come on. That is huge. But then there is the deep future. Perhaps in five 10 or 20 centuries from now we will have made it to Proxima's planet. That means in the same march of years that separates us from the time of Jesus and the Roman Empire this alien but neighbor planet may be home for billions of our descendants and have already become our first step outwards in the great adventure that is the stars.  Adam Frank's job on Earth is to teach astrophysics at the University of Rochester.
