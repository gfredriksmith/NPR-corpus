 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Imagine for a moment that you have several different loans at different interest rates - not a stretch for many of us. Now what strategy might you adopt to pay off those loans? Do you pay off the small ones first or do you tackle the ones with the highest interest rates? Well Dan Ariely of Duke University studies the predictably irrational behavior of us humans and he has been researching these very questions.  So we started with the study in which we gave people five loans. We said you have these five loans. They all represent real money and every month you will get some salary and you have to decide which loans you pay off faster and which direction and so on. And the amount of money you will get at the end of the experiment is proportional to how much money you have in this pretend life. So it was for real money that people could make and they made decision based on their you know best interest. And we tested over a thousand people. And the decision should be very simple. You pay off the loans with the highest interest rate. These are the loans that cost the most amount of money. What we actually found is that nobody not a single person has done that. And these include MBA students who took finance classes and undergrads and people who read Fortune magazine - lots and lots of people. Now what do people do instead? They try to get rid of loans. If you have five loans it makes you really happy to get down to four loans. So you try to get that. And if you have four you really get happy by getting it to three. So people pay the loans with the lowest amount and they do not look at the interest rate. And this of course is financially very devastating.  So you mean if among my five loans there is a balance of 200 with a 4 percent interest rate on it but there is also another balance of 2000 with an 18 percent interest rate what you find I am more likely to pay off the smaller loan with the smaller interest rate than go after the big loan where I am really getting hit by the interest rate? Prof.  That is right. That is exactly right. And what we also found is that there are things you can do to fix this. And you can actually -for example if I tell you you can never close any loans it is prohibited.  Uh-huh. Prof.  No loans can ever be closed...  I will always have five loans open. Prof.  All of a sudden this temptation to close loans goes away. You just cannot do it. And all of a sudden people become rational. They actually understand what to do with their money. So this temptation to close loans down actually is very hurting. We also found that we can do loan consolidation.  Right. Prof.  Right? So what loan consolidation do - I mean there is lots of terrible things in the market out there. But we should - what if we did loan consolidation in a way that basically prohibited people from doing these mistakes? And it turns out we can do loan consolidation that take more interest rates but actually help people. In some sense everybody benefits - the loan consolidator benefits and the people benefits.  Because our impulse is to want to see that zero balance on some loan even if it is a relatively cheap loan that is doing us less harm than another loan. Prof.  That is right.  What did you find about that item often on a loan statement which says minimum payment due? Prof.  Yeah that is actually a very disturbing part because companies are emphasizing it to a great degree. And what people usually do is they look at it as a recommendation.   Of how much you should pay? Prof.  That is right. This is the right amount. And of course companies are setting it up so this is incredibly dangerous to follow that recommendation.  But the suggestions that we see on that bill even if they are pointing us in a bad direction they are very meaningful. They condition how we are going to respond. Prof.  That is right. The moment you have suggested the amount it kind of anchors you. It is a starting point. And you say hey I can do that. Let me do that. And that could be a very bad strategy.  Dan Ariely thanks for talking with us once again. Prof.  My pleasure.  Dan Ariely is a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University the author of The Upside of Irrationality.
