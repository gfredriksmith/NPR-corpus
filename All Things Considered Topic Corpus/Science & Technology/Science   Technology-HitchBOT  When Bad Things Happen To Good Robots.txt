 A bad thing has happened to a good robot. Over the weekend the creators of hitchBOT the hitchhiking robot tweeted a disturbing photo taken on a narrow Philadelphia street.  It shows the robot in pieces its plastic head and blue pool-noodle arms torn from its bucket-shaped body.  I was profoundly surprised and then when I saw that image I was upset. It is an upsetting image. And of course one wonders what happened here - why?  Frauke Zeller is one of the creators of hitchBOT. It was part of a social experiment launched last year to learn more about how people and robots can interact.  HitchBOT was built to look nonthreatening. It seemed to be made of spare parts and it was the size of a small child.  And it needed help. People had to pick it up strap it into their vehicles and plug its power cord into a cigarette lighter.  Would you like to have a conversation?  They could talk with it and take pictures with it. On Instagram hitchBOT can be seen pumping gas operating a plane and taking a boat ride.  The robot had successfully traveled through Europe and Canada but it only lasted two weeks in the U.S. before it was vandalized in Philadelphia.  As disappointed as the hitchBOT team is Frauke Zeller says they do not want this one nasty act to overshadow all of the joy that hitchBOT brought.  When we are around with hitchBOT we see just how people smile when they see it that it brings a smile on people's face. And then they come and ask and what is this you know? Or oh is not that the hitchhiking robot?  HitchBOT's team is considering what is next for the project. In the meantime a Philadelphia tech group known as The Hacktory has offered to help the team rebuild the robot.  Now that is the city of brotherly love.
