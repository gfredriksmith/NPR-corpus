 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Melissa Block.  And I am Audie Cornish. And it is time now for All Tech Considered.   Joining me now from San Francisco is NPR's Laura Sydell to tell us about the week ahead in tech. And Laura I want to start with this meeting of the minds in the tech world. Heavy hitters right?  Yes that is right. TechCrunch Disrupt it is called put on by the tech blog TechCrunch. And they bring together start-ups from all over the world to compete for a 50000 prize and investors go there to check it out. And they have people talk and they have interviews. Mark Zuckerberg is going to be there - first time he is given an interview since Facebook's IPO. And of course their stock has been going down. Jack Dorsey who is now the CEO of the mobile payment company Square but who was a founder of Twitter. Marissa Mayer the CEO of Yahoo! is expected to be there. So some big names.  But there is another big tech event scheduled this week. Apple is meeting right? I mean what is this going to be about?  It looks like they are going to introduce a new iPhone probably called the iPhone 5. And rumor has it - and I have seen some pretty good pictures here that make it seem true - that it will be thinner and bigger and that it will have a different connector which means all those people who have purchased docks and all sorts of products the new phone will not fit into it. So there is a lot of talk about that.
