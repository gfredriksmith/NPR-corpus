 The Iron Man suit has not taken off yet but Kirobo has already left for space.    Kirobo is meant to be a companion for Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata. It will also be able to communicate with another robot back on Earth presumably if Kirobo and Wakata run out of things to talk about. Before the launch  One small step for me a giant leap for robots. Well for mankind's sake we just hope Kirobo's personality is like this.   And not this.
