 What happens when one of the world's most notorious hacking companies gets hacked? Well that is the situation unfolding for an Italian firm. As NPR's Elise Hu explains it sells software to governments large and small with this kind of message.   Rely on us.  This is a recent advertisement for surveillance software from a company called HackingTeam. The software can track citizens access text messages emails and overcome data encryption.   Exactly what we do - the hacking suite for governmental interception.  HackingTeam sells its work as quote stealth and untraceable. But the surveillance company itself just had its secrets spilled out in the form of a 500-gigabyte data dump. Whoever's behind the stolen data has not come forward. NPR verified that at least some of the hacked personal passwords do check out. And if the other documents are true they show HackingTeam sells its software to private companies in at least three dozen countries. That includes the United States and some of the world's most repressive regimes.  These documents provide finally a smoking gun showing that HackingTeam has in fact sold its technology to a number of governments with truly atrocious human rights record.  Christopher Soghian is a privacy activist with the ACLU. He is reviewed 500 gigs and found evidence of hacking teams selling to Russia Kazakhstan and Sudan the very surveillance-enabling code-breaking  What this shows us is that surveillance software - advanced surveillance capabilities are now available to the largest and smallest governments in the world. We really need to have a bigger conversation about whether these tools should be used in democracies.   .  For now the person who answered the phone at HackingTeam's Italian headquarters directed questions to an email address. But much of the information that had been a mystery like the company's client lists and contracts are now published online. Elise Hu NPR News.
