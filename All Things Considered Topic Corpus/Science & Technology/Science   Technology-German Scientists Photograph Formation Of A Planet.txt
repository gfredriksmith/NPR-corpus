 The laws of planetary motion were first described by a 17th-century German scientist Johannes Kepler.  Now a 21st-century German scientist named Miriam Keppler has made her mark in the very same realm as her namesake. By the way she is not related.  The name Keppler is just a coincidence .  This Keppler led a team that has snapped the first-ever photo of a planet being formed. The planet's called PDS 70b.  Of course we were very excited.  The photo is the result of several years of observation by the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg Germany.  Detection of young planets is very challenging.  For starters PDS 70b is far away - about 370 light years from Earth.  OK. Second it is orbiting a star that is many times brighter than it is and third...  Around these young stars we find a lot of gas and dust which is shaped in a thin disk. This is still remnant from the star formation.  But PDS 70b happened to be in a gap of that dust and gas which made the photograph possible.  So what do we know about this planet being formed? Well it is bigger than Jupiter and it takes a long time to orbit its host star.  It takes about 118 years to fulfill one orbit around its own sun.  And that orbit is 22 times Earth's distance to the sun. PDS 70b's star is a mere baby compared to our own - only 10 million years old. Ours is way older - 4.6 billion years.  The data from this observation gives science a way to look back into our own planetary past. Andre Muller is another member of the team at the Planck Institute.  We are now have starting to gather data to understand much better how own solar system may have formed.  And if we here on Earth can take a picture of a distant planet does Muller think somewhere out there another civilization might just be snapping pictures of us?  Oh we certainly hope so.  Fellow earthlings say cheese.
