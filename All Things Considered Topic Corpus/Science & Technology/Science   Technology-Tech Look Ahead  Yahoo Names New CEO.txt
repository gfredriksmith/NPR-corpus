 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  And I am Audie Cornish. And it is time now for All Tech Considered.   Yahoo has a new CEO. In a move that surprised many Silicon Valley watchers Marissa Mayer a vice president of Google is taking the helm. NPR's Laura Sydell joins me now to talk about it. And Laura who is Marissa Mayer?  Well she is often been very much in the public because she was one of Google's first 20 employees and its first female engineer. She is responsible for the look and the feel of many of Google's products including its unadorned white homepage Gmail Google News and Google Images. Most recently she has been a vice president and she is been in charge of its location and local services and that includes Google Maps.  So Laura why do you think Yahoo went after her?  Well Yahoo has been struggling. Its shares have fallen 41 percent in five years. And Mayer brings her engineering background to the company and there are a lot of people who say what is hurting Yahoo is that it is not giving users a good experience. Mayer has a track record of creating excellent user experiences at Google.  So the real question would be why would Mayer take on the job of running this struggling company?  Good question. Well I think she might not have been that happy with recent rearrangements at the top at Google and so she is probably been looking for new opportunities. And this is a chance to run a company. And if she can turn it around that is huge. And this will make her one of the most powerful women in tech.  NPR's Laura Sydell. Thanks Laura.  You are welcome.
