 Imagine this four months of Moby Dick. Now this may thrill some of you but others might ask why would I willingly subject myself to that?  Hey it is just a chapter a day. All you have to do is go online download and listen.   That is actress Tilda Swinton reading chapter one.   I think it is a really good way of getting it back into the mainstream because this is the greatest American novel but it is so unread.  That is writer Philip Hoare. He is nearly as obsessed with Melville's novel as Ahab was obsessed with that white whale. Hoare and artist Angela Cockyne have teamed up to make Moby Dick more accessible to 21st century audiences at mobydickbigread.com. And if you think Moby Dick published in 1851 is too creaky for the Internet age Hoare says think again.  Remember Moby Dick itself was not edited. It is really like one long blog. Not only that but the sense of digressiveness of his narrative which meanders here there and everywhere - the same way as you move through a search engine when you are chasing a subject.  Hoare even ventures to say that if Melville were writing Moby Dick today he might not finish it. He would get so distracted researching whales online. Well each day until mid-January a new chapter of Moby Dick will be available along with an illustration by a contemporary artist. That is 136 installments read by actors authors fishermen and British Prime Minister David Cameron. They cost you nothing but time.  There are some surprise readers too. Like celebrated camp film director John Waters.  John said I would never read Moby Dick in a million years. And yet he sat down and delivered this 19th century prose with the most exquisite humor and irony.   That is John Waters reading chapter 95.  Alas Robert. You will have to wait about a month and a half to hear the rest of his contribution.
