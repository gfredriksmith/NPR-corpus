 We are going to hear one last excerpt from one of those 50 cent paperbacks courtesy of the man himself. In 2004 Elmore Leonard appeared on NPR's WEEKEND  read from his novel Mr. Paradise. We could tell you a little something about the story but true to form the dialogue is the story.   Lloyd wearing a starched white dress shirt hanging out of his pants opened the front door and stood facing Jackie Michaels in her winter coat her patterned red scarf her hair combed out no dreads this morning Jackie looking at peace.  Now what you want?  Her gaze came up from the square of cardboard taped over the broken pane of glass to Lloyd. You ever gonna get that fixed?  I had to find out who is paying for it Lloyd said. He stared at Jackie another few moments. I do not have to let you in do I?  It is still considered a crime scene Jackie said. I can come in if I want but I am leaving it up to you.  You have a different tone of voice this morning Lloyd said. Come on in and let us see if it works on me.  Lloyd smiled at her showing gold in his teeth. You know how old I am you been through my jacket a few times have not you? You wondering could this 71-year-old geezer play any part in this? I bet you think you know all about me my scores the falls I took.  I will tell you something Lloyd said. I was only 60 you would have smelled my lust before we are through the dining room.  Jackie said takes a little longer now?  Reading from his novel Mr. Paradise that is Elmore Dutch Leonard. He died today at the age of 87.   This is NPR.
