 And here's what' the sequel. The movie studios will release more part twos threes or fours than it ever has - 28 at last count. Our critic Bob Mondello says that may be good for the industry's bottom line but it is making his job tricky.  Unidentified Man 1   Let us finish this the way we started.   Warner Brothers split the last Harry Potter novel into a pair of films so this second Deathly Hallows is  Part 7 Part 2.   ...    It is time for the next phase of your journey.   Unidentified Man 5   Are you saying we cannot stop this?   Second films are easier to get financing for they are already cast and they are pre-sold. So promoting them is simple so much so that the second film in a series often outperforms the first at the box office. After that the glow generally fades.  Hangover II...    I cannot believe this is happening again.  Pirates Of The Caribbean IV...    Is that really necessary?  Unidentified Man 7   We will do one last job and then we disappear forever.   I am Bob Mondello.
