 You are probably familiar with these voices.   Hello I am Bob Ross.   What makes a great chef?   Hey neighbor welcome again to this neighborhood.  The voices of the late Fred Rogers Julia Child and Bob Ross. But have you ever heard them like this?    I believe I believe every day is a good day when you paint.    I like to smell something cooking makes me feel at home.    It is good to be curious about many things.  That is also Fred Rogers Julia Child and Bob Ross auto-tuned. To try to keep current with the times PBS asked musician John Boswell to create remixes of some of the network's most iconic figures and John Boswell joins me now. Welcome to the program John.  Thanks for having me.  Why do not you walk us through your process here how you created these little songs around - by auto-tuning the voices of Fred Rogers Julie Child and Bob Ross?  Well it all starts with watching the old episodes and there is plenty to watch. But what I try and do is I try and pick up the funniest parts the most inspiring parts the parts that get across the person's message and I will isolate those samples and kind of collect them and try and see what kind of message I want to carry across in the final song. And then what I do from there is I go ahead and construct a song around what the message is and I start with a chorus so something that will be repeated throughout the song and then I...  Like bring on the roasted potatoes for Julia Child.  Exactly yes.   It was just too good to pass up.   And then I will build the verses around that and kind of - it takes on a life of its own. It is a lot of experimentation and trial and error but it kind of coalesces into something consistent and unique and really fun to do.  So when you are watching the video say of the painter Bob Ross and he says let us build a happy little cloud.   Would you immediately think oh that is it? I have got to use that.  Oh yeah. I mean he has certain trademarks that you cannot pass up. Happy clouds happy trees I think I had a collection of about 10 different happy little things that I wanted to use and I had to just choose clouds and trees you know but he was going off about happy little bushes and happy little cabins and all that good stuff.   So it was just a lot of fun.  What about for Mr. Rogers a favorite moment for him?  You know there was a lot of really goofy stuff he did and there is a lot of funny stuff. But I think his best moments was when he would just sit down at the camera and just kind of talk to you straight up and give you these pieces of - his little personal philosophy that would really have an impact.   Even now you know 20 years later I still listen to what he has to say and it is really touching.  It is interesting when you watch these videos and listen to the songs I mean it - they are quite lovely tributes really to these icons who have passed on who are no longer with us.  Yeah. I think a lot of people when they you know click the link to the YouTube video they are expecting something kind of goofy and disrespectful or just quick and non-interesting. But what I try and do is I respect the original message that each of these people kind of tried to convey and I try and do that with respectful music and not too jarring of remixed work. And a lot of people have commented saying you know this - I came here expecting that but you know what I have got was something kind of touching. You know a lot of people have been - have had emotional responses and I think that is partially due to nostalgia and partially due to the musical treatment that is kind of going along with the message. You know it is kind of the whole package that makes them kind of you know realize that this is something touching.  That is musician John Boswell in Bellingham Washington who auto-tuned Fred Rogers Julia Child and Bob Ross for PBS. John thanks so much.  Thanks for having me.
