 Alan Cheuse has our review.  Long before the time his story reaches a climax in the smugglers paradise of Ciudad del Este Paraguay where the borders of Brazil Argentina and Paraguay meet the reader will be racing along through the pages of Rotella's novel at near breakneck speed.  Triple Crossing is the new novel from journalist Sebastian Rotella. Our reviewer Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia.
