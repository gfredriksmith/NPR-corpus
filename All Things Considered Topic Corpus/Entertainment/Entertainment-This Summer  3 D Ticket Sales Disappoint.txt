 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  And I am Melissa Block.  America has a new patent law. President Obama signed the America Invents Act today.  If we want startups here and if we want established companies like a DuPont or a Eli Lily to continue to make products here and hire here then we are going to have to be able to compete with any other country around the world. So this patent bill will encourage that innovation.  NPR's Laura Sydell joins me now to talk about the bill. And Laura what does this bill do?  And supposedly it will speed up the process of filing for patents which right now there is something like 700000 applications that are backlogged in the Patent Office.  So when they are talking about creating jobs well they are hiring some more patent inspectors so that is some jobs right there.   What is the broader goal in terms of job creation here?  Well this is what they say. What they say is if we speed things up and we get that backlog cleared up then there are all these startups that are just waiting to move to the next phase of financing and get their products to market. And they will be able to do that and they will hire people in the process. So that is what they are saying.  And what about those businesses Laura or inventors entrepreneurs - do they think that the law will in fact encourage hiring make them hire more people?  The Patent Office has granted for example in 2000 they granted a patent for a method of making toast. Really seriously.  Laura what other solutions would there be to this problem of bad patents that you are talking about that would not involve Congress?  I think a lot of people wish Congress would revisit this soon. And they are worried that because they just granted and created this new act it will be a long time before Congress steps in again which really would be the fastest and most efficient way to address the problem.  Laura thanks very much.  You are welcome.
