 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Audie Cornish.  And I am Melissa Block. Twenty years ago this week this megamovie roared into theaters.   Jurassic Park the 1993 film brought dinosaurs to life in a way that had never been done before.   Yup. That is one scary tyrannosaurus.  I think I was 13 when that movie came out so it has played a big part in my childhood and my life.  That is Michael Dhar. He writes for LiveScience.com. As a fan he wrote an article comparing what we know of dinosaurs today with the science featured in that movie two decades ago.  Let us take the movie version of T-rex.    Well we clocked the T-rex at 32 miles an hour.   You said you have got a T-rex?   Uh-huh.   Say again?   We have a T-rex.  In the movie the T-rex chased after cars and ate people but Dhar says not so.  The T-rex in the film was portrayed as this hunter who goes after big prey but the evidence shows that the T-rex operated more like a scavenger. So he would have looked for prey that was already dead. He would not have run very fast.  More recent science suggests dinosaurs would also have looked quite different. They were more colorful and...  It is probable that if you were actually to go back in time and look at the T-rex it would be no maybe kind of cute. It would have a lot of plumage and feathers.  Cute? Bright plumage and feathers? What?   So maybe they would have been less of that and more of this.    And now a poem by Big Bird. That is me.  T-rex was more like a Big Bird according to Michael Dhar at LiveScience but could that work in a dinosaur movie?  I guess you can make anything scary. Big Bird with teeth might be a little frightening as well.  I do not know Audie. Big Bird's definitely not as scary.
