 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.  Now  When is a Starbucks not a Starbucks? Today the coffee giant opened a new store in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. But you will not see that ubiquitous Starbucks logo. This cafe is called 15th Avenue Coffee and Tea. And aside from the words inspired by Starbucks in smaller print on the front door there is nary a hint of the true owner. From Seattle NPR's Wendy Kaufman reports.  For more than three decades Starbucks has been building a brand spreading its name around the globe. Now the company is setting aside that corporate image as it tries to create a store with the vibe of an independent neighborhood cafe. Mr. D.  If you look around here there is no standard coffee brewer.  Major Cohen the cafe's project manager gave reporters a sneak peek yesterday. Mr.  So if you come in for a coffee tomorrow and you look in the open bins and you say wow I would like to try that Guatemala Antigua we will measure the  You can grab and go or sit in this spare and sophisticated space that looks and feels more like a wine bar than a coffee shop. That is no accident. The wine and beer will be served. As for the coffee the beans will be Starbucks. But they will be roasted in smaller batches. And baristas will make lattes on traditional espresso machines. Cohen calls all this a re-imagination and says customers will be surprised. Mr.  They are going to be shocked. And we hope that they are curious and that they come in here and discover new things about Starbucks and that they have a different perception of Starbucks better I hope but they are going to have - clearly going to have a sense that we are presenting ourselves differently here.  Cohen bristles just a bit at the suggestion that the new cafe exposes some of the weaknesses of the old but even company CEO Howard Schultz has bemoaned that Starbucks had lost its soul hardly surprising when you have more than 15000 stores. Many ideas for the new cafe came from inside the corporation but others came from scouting trips. Starbucks folks visited places like Seattle Coffee Works more than once. One of that caf's owners Sebastian Simsch says he was flattered but Mr.  We are a coffeehouse. Coffeehouses have been around for many many centuries. What are we doing that they cannot figure out on their own? Mr.  One of the challenges for Starbucks today it is not opening more stores that is for sure. It is getting more out of what they have.  Brand consultant Scott Bedbury says by offering entertainment beer and wine Starbucks' new caf can bring in customers when it would otherwise be empty. Bedbury who worked at Starbucks for many years likes the 15th Avenue Cafe for another reason. Starbucks he says expanded too far too fast. Now if it wants to grow it will have to move in a different direction. Mr.  Every brand has a stretch point. You know  You can only push them so far so wide and so fast. And you do not overheat any one brand. You may develop a second brand. You may develop a third brand.  On the street in the Capitol Hill neighborhood we asked Penny Lane and Eric Fleish for their reaction to Starbucks' potential second brand. Ms.  I am looking at the exterior and I am really liking their style from what I can see. Mr.  It is totally insidious to like masquerade to trick the people who are specifically boycotting Starbucks into going to their place anyway.  Fleish who hails from Boston worries that what Starbucks starts in Seattle will move east but Starbucks says its only planned expansion of the cafe concept is two more cafes in Seattle.
