 Spoiler alert - if you are a Jeopardy! fan and you are planning on watching tonight's episode you might want to turn your radio down for the next two minutes.  James Holzhauer a professional gambler from Las Vegas has become a Jeopardy! phenomenon over the past few weeks. He won 32 games in a row and rewrote the show is history books with huge victories like this one in April.   You have just set a one-day record - again - 131000.   Holzhauer racked up those numbers by using an aggressive and unusual strategy as sports commentator Mike Pesca explained on NPR.   He stalks the board like a predator in an attempt to build up his bankroll with the hardest questions first. Then he makes huge bets when the Jeopardy! board reveals a Daily Double.  Fans were waiting to see if Holzhauer would break the all-time record set by Ken Jennings in 2004. Jennings made over 2.5 million during a 74-game winning streak.  But here's what is on tonight's episode. A librarian named Emma Boettcher was ahead as Final Jeopardy came up.   Over to James now - he had 23400. And his response was correct. His wager - a modest one for the first time. So Emma it is up to you. If you came up with a correct response you are going to be the new Jeopardy! champion.  Not only did she also get it right she cashed in with a big wager in true James Holzhauer style.   Oh gosh - 20000 - what a payday.   Holzhauer's run may be over but he did not seem too upset. He even walked over to give Boettcher a high-five.  He leaves Jeopardy! without the record but is leaving with 2.4 million.
