 Are you a car lover?  Are you a fan of Matthew Broderick? Have you seen Ferris Bueller's Day Off more than 20 times?  Do you also have an extra few hundred thousand dollars lying around your house?  Now if you said yes to all of these questions we know of a shiny red sports car with your name all over it.    The 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California.    Oh yeah.  Oh yeah. That car.    Less than a hundred were made.    Oh yeah.   Father spent three years restoring this car. It is his love. It is his passion.   It is his fault he did not lock the garage.  That car the one that Cameron Frye's dad left in his unlocked garage will be on the auction block tomorrow.  OK OK OK. Before we get your tweets and your emails we know - we know. The car in Ferris Bueller's Day Off was not a real Ferrari. It was a replica built in 1985 just for the movie.  So how much could this prop be worth? Well a real 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California sold two years ago for just over 17 million.    Here's where Cameron goes berserk.   .  However the genuine replica is expected to go for much less - about 350000.  Oh is that it?  Yeah you know . But Ferris fanatics could bump that price higher at auction.  Adding to its worth it is on the National Historic Vehicle Register so you can own a piece of movie and automotive history.  And if you are still unsure let Ferris Bueller himself close the deal for you.    I must be honest here. I love driving it. It is so choice. If you have the means I highly recommend picking one up.  And if you have the desire but not the means you can still at least gawk at the car before it is sold tomorrow in Monterey Calif. But be careful. You know it is going to move fast. If you do not stop to look at the fake Ferrari you could miss it.    Beautiful. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.
