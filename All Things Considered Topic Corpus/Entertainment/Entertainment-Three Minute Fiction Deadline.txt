  It is the last call for all our writers out there. 59 p.m. Eastern is the deadline to submit your story for our Three-Minute Fiction contest. Now remember all stories must be less than 600 words and only one entry per person. And here's our judge the novelist Brad Meltzer to give you a refresher on your writing challenge.  Your story must revolve around a U.S. president who can be fictional or real.  The winning story will be read in its entirety on the program and the winner will get a chance to come on the show. And for the first time in Three-Minute Fiction history the winning story will be published in the December issue of Paris Review. For all the rules and to submit your story visit npr.orgthreeminutefiction. That is Three-Minute Fiction all the words spelled out without any spaces. So get to it and very good luck.
