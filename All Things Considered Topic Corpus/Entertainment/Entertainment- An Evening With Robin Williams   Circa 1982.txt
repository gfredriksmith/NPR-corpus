 And finally this hour some words from Robin Williams himself from his 1982 stand-up special An Evening With Robin Williams. In this part Williams is performing on stage when a woman in the audience suddenly gets up from her seat to leave.   Wait do not go now. Do not go. You are going to miss the really heavy duty stuff. OK we will wait.   No pressure.   Let us put on that closed-circuit video. No she will be back in a few minutes.   Go see if she is OK will you?   Dammit the poor woman might be trapped.   Allison.  Her name is Allison?  Allison.  Allison?  Allison.  Allison. Allison this is the police. We know you are in there.   Allison if you come out we will not have to have a fight Allison. Come on out. We are going to throw in some stuff in there if you are not coming out Allison. We have got the dogs out here. . Allison we brought your mother.  Allie come out.   Allie come out of the bathroom now girl. Allison we brought Rabbi Tom with us too.  Allie what you doing in there?
