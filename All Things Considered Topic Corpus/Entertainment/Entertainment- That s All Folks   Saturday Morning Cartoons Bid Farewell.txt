 This next item will be especially painful for Gen X-ers and even some Millennials. Saturday morning cartoons are officially a thing of the past.    That is all folks.  No really - that is it.   Since the 1990s TV networks have been pulling the plug on the cartoon block. The CW Network had been the only one hanging on until this weekend. Now you will have to pass down to your children the stories of the good old days - waking at the crack of dawn pouring yourself a bowl of frosted flakes and waiting anxiously through the commercials to see if Poppa Smurf would once again outsmart that wily Gargamel.  He always did by the way.    La la la la la la. Sing a happy song. La la la la la la.  And now that the Smurf song is stuck in your head we bid goodbye to the unique institution of Saturday morning cartoons.    So long Sammy. See you in Miami.  And a note of thanks on behalf of all the parents for whom those shows meant a little more sleep on a Saturday morning. So no more Alvin And The Chipmunks.    Watch out 'ecause here we come. It is been awhile but we are back in style. So...  Goodbye Care Bears. Goodbye Gummi Bears.   Gummi Bears bouncing here and there and everywhere.  Mighty Mouse we salute you.    Here I come to save the day. That means that...  Snorks adieu.   The Snorks - play along with the Snorks.  Tell us who got you to the TV on Saturday mornings - the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles perhaps? Popeye?   Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - heroes in a half-shell - turtle power. They are the world's most fearsome fighting team. We are really hip. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles...  Join the conversation on Twitter. We are npratc. You can find me rachelnpr.
