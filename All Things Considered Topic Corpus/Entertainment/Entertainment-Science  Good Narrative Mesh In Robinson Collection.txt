 Science fiction writer Kim Stanley Robinson has done it all. His books include a trilogy about the terraforming of Mars an alternative history in which the Chinese and Arabs discover America and a trilogy about global warming in which Washington D.C. ends up under a lot of water. His latest book is a collection of several decades of his short fiction under the title The Best of Kim Stanley Robinson and Alan Cheuse has this review.  Robinson is a former English major who wrote a doctoral dissertation on the maverick novels of Philip K. Dick. So it is not surprising that his love of science technology and good narrative come together in these 20-some mostly delightful short stories. There is this ecological and climate obsession in the opening story of a drowned Venice. There is his out-and-out science fiction tale done to perfection. In Before I Wake Earth has entered a powerful electromagnetic field that drives human beings back and forth between waking and sleeping waking and sleeping. In a wonderful little story about an interplanetary translator called The Translator the main character wards off a ritual war between two very odd species of aliens the small hippo-like Ba'arnas and the nearly ugly beyond words the birdlike Igla. But from his deep interest in history Robinson also has made a wonderful story about a young crewman in the Spanish Armada called Black Air and a startling alternate history story of the dropping of the atomic bomb over Japan The Lucky Strike and a Voorhees-like creation called Vinland the Dream about a grand historical hoax on the shores of Maine. I also want to mention a story called A History of the 20th Century with Illustrations. That as with the best of short fiction escapes all classification and is almost beautiful beyond words.  The collection is called The Best of Kim Stanley Robinson. Our reviewer Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University.   This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
