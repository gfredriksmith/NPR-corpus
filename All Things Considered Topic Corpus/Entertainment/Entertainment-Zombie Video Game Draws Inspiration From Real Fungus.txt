 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.  Just what we need another pop culture zombie apocalypse - more desperate humans fighting against mindless creatures that used to be humans until they were transformed into soulless monsters. In this case the particular apocalypse is in a video game called The Last of Us.   But this fight is not against your everyday zombies. The designers of the The Last of Us base these creatures on some actual science. Beth Accomando of member station KPBS tells us about this imaginative leap from science to science fiction.  If you consume a healthy dose of pop entertainment you might feel as though humanity is in constant peril from zombies infected people and even a good old-fashioned biblical apocalypse. But that felt like old news to Neil Druckmann creative director for The Last of Us. He wanted to find a fresh way to wipe out humanity and he found it in the BBC Planet Earth documentary and its depiction of what the cordyceps fungus does to ants.   It is this fungus that burrows its way into insects' minds and completely alters their behavior. And you know right away the idea popped in our head like what if it jumped to humans. So you could imagine this fate worse than death that your mind is still there but something else is controlling your body.  Ew. That sounds like the horrific plot of a science-fiction tale.  Yeah right exactly.  That is entomologist Michael Wall of the San Diego Natural History Museum.  The insect world I think very often inspires science-fiction writers and moviemakers and clearly in this case video game producers.  Taking its cue from Mother Nature's darker side The Last of Us presents a mutated strain of the cordyceps fungus that turns human hosts into rabid ferocious killers.   Players trek through a post-apocalyptic United States encountering the creatures in various stages of infection.   Michael Wall quickly became infected by the game's premise.  It is not just like all of a sudden these are normal folks who just happen to have really weird fungal growths coming out of their body. I mean they are lurking around. I mean they are talking about them now using echolocation to find other people.   They are definitely tapping into this idea that parasites can change the behavior of their hosts and make their hosts do things to the benefit of the parasite.  The loss of freewill might be the most terrifying thing humans can imagine but it is common in the insect world. That is one of the reasons entomology got under Wall's skin but he is not worried about cordyceps burrowing into his brain.  Jumping from the insect world to human world is highly unlikely. Several thousand of these species of fungus can occur on lots of different insects so you might think like oh wow then why could not it jump over to us? But in terms of the evolutionary family tree humans and insects are really far apart.  But close enough to stimulate someone's imagination. In fact Wall might want to put a bug in the entertainment industry's ear. He knows some insect stories involving mind control behavior modification and strange exoskeleton designs.
