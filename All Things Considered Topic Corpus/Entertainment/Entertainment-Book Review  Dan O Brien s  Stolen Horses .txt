 In the novel Stolen Horses change comes to a small fictional cattle town in Nebraska's panhandle. Old West and New West seem to be set for a showdown. Our reviewer Alan Cheuse says the book's author Dan O'Brien knows just how to dramatize the situation.  About the novel itself this says it for me too.  The book is Stolen Horses by Dan O'Brien. Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia.
