 It is been a mediocre summer so far for Hollywood box office numbers - down about 11 percent from last summer. But one movie has had remarkable staying power.   Wonder Woman opened 10 weeks ago and is still playing in more than a thousand theaters. Most movies stay in theaters for just a couple of weeks. NPR's Ted Robbins filed this report.    Only love can truly save the world.  Not the usual wisecrack out of a modern superhero's mouth. And we know Wonder Woman is - pardon the oxymoron - no ordinary superhero not on screen and not at the box office. She is about to surpass 400 million in North American ticket sales. Add in international box office and she is nearly doubled that.  Well it is obliterated expectations.  That is Paul Dergarabedian senior analyst for global media measurement company comScore. Wonder Woman is the first female standalone superhero movie directed by a woman Patty Jenkins.  For this movie to kind of break through that ceiling and prove that there are no stereotypes when it comes to making movies. The fact that we even have to have that discussion is sort of ridiculous that can a female director possibly direct a big-budget action superhero movie? Well that question has been resoundingly answered. Now they made it look kind of easy. That does not mean every time out of the gate you are going to have this kind of result. But Wonder Woman 2 is already greenlit. It is not a billion-dollar movie worldwide but it is meant so much more than that. And really as it gets close to 800 million worldwide it is a total winner.  Wonder Woman's staying power has as much to do with its message as it does with its quality and fun as a movie.  Wonder Woman is a film that generated goodwill on so many levels.  But it is still not the No. 1 movie of 2017. That is the live-action version of Beauty And The Beast. Apparently a sword and shield is not yet a match for a tale as old as time and a talking candlestick. Ted Robbins NPR News Culver City.
