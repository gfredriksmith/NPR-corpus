 Still on the topic of new books we have a review now of a novel that may be painful to read but our critic says it is worth it. The Oriental Wife by English novelist Evelyn Toynton uses Hitler's Germany as a backdrop and New York City as the setting for a story about love and survival. Here is reviewer Alan Cheuse.  In case you are worried this novel might veer more toward soap opera than superior fiction consider that last line. No soap opera I know ever made you feel that. No no no.  The novel is The Oriental Wife by Evelyn Toynton. Our reviewer Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia.
