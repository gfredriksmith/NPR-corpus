 OK so I clearly need to watch that movie. Last summer our colleague Steve Inskeep of Morning Edition interviewed two people who did just that. They were the children of actor Richard Dreyfuss who plays a marine biologist in Jaws. Emily and Ben Dreyfuss barely remembered the details of the movie and they told Steve all about the experience of re-watching it.  It was so hot in Boston I needed to be air-conditioned. And my husband pointed out that the movie theater right by our house was playing Jaws. And my gut reaction was I do not want to go see to Jaws in a movie theater. That is going to be totally weird. And then he reminded me that neither of us had seen it in years and that maybe it would be funny and it was awesome. It turns out I barely remembered it. I really thought my dad was the hero - not that he was not heroic but I thought he killed the shark basically single-handedly and then swam home.  I had just seen Jaws last year when my mother had said Oh look Jaws is on. My favorite part is when Dad kills the shark. And I was like Dad did not kill the shark. And she was like Shut up Ben. I was married to him. He killed Jaws.  B.  And so we watched it and of course he does not kill Jaws. And she was like - oh wow.  Ben and before him Emily Dreyfuss. Another thing - the movie's most famous line - we played it earlier - the one that goes...    You are to going to need a bigger boat.  That was not that their father Richard Dreyfuss who said it but almost everyone attributes it to him. B.  Our entire lives when people come up to my dad that is the line they always quote. One time he and I were in Miami and he corrected someone. And the person looked at him and said no you said it and walked away.  B.  And we are like - oh.   Ben Dreyfuss with his sister Emily last year on NPR's Morning Edition sharing their memories with of Jaws.   This is NPR News.
