 NPR's Richard Harris explains.  Figuring out the length of a day on Neptune has been a giant headache. The problem is as is true of the other gas giants you cannot see its surface. When you look at the greenish face of Neptune all you see is clouds clouds clouds. And Eric Karkoschka at the University of Arizona says that is a problem for astronomers like him who have been trying for many years to figure out how fast the planet is rotating.  Just like when Earth clouds sometimes move to the east sometimes to the west and sometimes they accelerate and so you cannot measure accurate rotation.  Karkoschka figured maybe there was another way so he poured over images of Neptune taken over more than 20 years to look at odds spots that are perpetually embedded in the clouds - and Eureka.  I could find two feature on Neptune in images taken starting from large images in 1989 until 2010 in Hubble's Space Telescope images. And they were so regular that I think that must indicate the interior rotation.  And if you time one full rotation you have the length of a day on Neptune.  Its 15.9663 hours and that should be more accurate than half a second.  Richard Harris NPR News.
