 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Competitors arrive at the Dutchess County Fair in Rhinebeck New York hoping to win blue ribbons for everything from goat milking prowess to prized heifers. And ever since the 1980s  their husbands. They did it again yesterday at the annual husband-calling contest. Lara Pellegrinelli checked it out at the Livestock Arena at the Dutchess County Fair.  Contrary to popular opinion these days you do not need to be wired to stay connected with your loved ones. At the Dutchess County Fair you' Can you hear me now?  John. Where are you?  The fair's annual husband-calling contest brings communication between a woman and her man back to the basics. Inspired by hog-calling events at other country fairs the contest was the brainchild of Andy Imperati. Mr.  The hogs could be a mile away and they' Eeee you know how they call hogs - and them hogs come running across the field. It is unbelievable. And then I thought oh God we do not have the hogs here. Maybe I will just turn it into a husband-calling contest. And it works out perfect.  You heard him. In agrarian Dutchess County they did not have swine to call so they found a ready substitute in their men folk. So what kind of call does Imperati's wife of 47 years use to motivate him? Mr.  Well I cannot tell you what she says most of the time right?  Mr.  I need two more volunteers to be judges.  Imperati pulls audience members out of the stands to serve as judges. They evaluate contestants on loudness clarity and creativity the reason Ernestine Martin dominated the competition for nearly a decade. Ms.   Bill I just got a phone call from my doctor. We have killed another rabbit sucker.  That call was not about a pet bunny but kidded about the arrival of baby number seven. This year Australian-born Margie Riordan scored points for her imaginative call taking second place. Ms.  Come here you big stud. I am waiting for you. Come home.  Ms.  Come on lovey. Show me those beautiful gray hairs that I gave you.  Ms.  Come home. I have got some chicken. I have got some goat even pigeon. We will make a barbecue. Come on lovey.  Even though Riordan's husband almost hopped the fence to reach her the winner was Donna Kuklis from Saugerties New York. She won 40 and the blue ribbon. Ms.  John. John where are you now? The kids are in the corn again. I told you do not let them go in there. Why are they there again? John I know you can hear me.   Actually John might not be able to hear her having weathered her calls for 11 years of marriage. Mr.  I cannot hear you.  Mr.  I just cannot hear anymore.  For NPR News I am Lara Pellegrinelli in New York. Ms.  John where are you?
