 Alan Cheuse has our review.  This first-time novelist has helped us to travel that brief but crucial distance from words on the page to dreams in our minds and hearts and made this bitter brutal time somehow reachable.  Our reviewer Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia.
