 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. The first Encyclopedia Brown book was published nearly 50 years ago. The series has never gone out of print. Its creator Donald Sobol died last week. He was 87. Writer Jonathan Hayes has this appreciation of Sobol's boy detective.  While other boys got hooked on books about sports legends and race car drivers there was something about Donald J. Sobol's boy detective Encyclopedia Brown that spoke to me right away. Leroy Brown was nicknamed Encyclopedia because he was a genius a decent brilliant kid who earned the respect of grownups by using his brain to crack cases. He did this usually by exposing an inconsistency in the perp's statement like you could not have been driving the car when you said because the hood would still be too hot for that baby to be standing on. That the perp was an adult outwitted by a guy my age - maybe 10 or so - was icing on the cake. Encyclopedia's dad was chief of police in Idaville Florida. His son was always the better crime fighter. Of course much of the wrongdoing with which Encyclopedia dealt was not serious enough to warrant Chief Brown's involvement - Encyclopedia devoted much of his time to sorting out the school's bullies - Bugs Meany and the Tigers his gang of delinquents. Now the Tigers could not beat up Encyclopedia because of his best friend and assistant Sally Kimball who was tougher than they were.  I grew up believing that women could be just as smart and brave as men and longed to have if not an actual girlfriend a Sally of my own by my side. I loved these stories because they were about a kid like me a kid who solved mysteries with logic and common sense often exposing the hypocrisy of foolishly dismissive adults. I loved the sense of order and balance restored to the world at the end of each story. This is the true resolution at the heart of all good crime fiction. And I loved these mysteries because I was good at them good at picking up on just what was wrong with a broken mirror at spotting the lie of the swindling high school dropout. As things turned out I became a forensic pathologist and a writer. It took me a while to realize Sobol's influence on me. But one night in the middle of the Everglades waiting for park rangers at the scene of a shotgun killing I finally saw the trail that led from Encyclopedia to that moment a million years and a million miles apart. I moved on from Encyclopedia Brown to Sherlock Holmes and then on to the village library where I spent hours lost in books about fingerprints and techniques of counterfeiting. And from there it was just a short step to forensic medicine. As a medical examiner I am an expert in the evaluation of gunshot and stab wounds but common sense and logic is still very much the foundation of my work - the hunt for the wrong detail the sustained skepticism about witness statements. My cases now are complex and brutal and they occur in a real world far from the Browns' dinner table. I realize that I long for the simplicity of that world with its clear definitive answers and its fast return to happy stability. I long for the idealized world of childhood.   That is Jonathan Hayes author most recently of the thriller A Hard Death. He lives in New York City. He was remembering children's book writer Donald Sobol who died last week. Another book in Sobol's series is set to be published this fall - Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Soccer Scheme.
