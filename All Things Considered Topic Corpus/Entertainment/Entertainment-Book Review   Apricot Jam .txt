 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Melissa Block.  Now eight of the stories he authored in his later years are available in English for the first time. The collection is called Apricot Jam. Alan Cheuse has a review.  From the tiniest details of everyday life the scarcity of school notebooks to the grandest the massive starvation in the countryside and ranging from the early 1920s to the post-World War II period these stories in Apricot Jam give us the feel as well as the understanding of these troubled troubled times.  The collection of stories from Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn is titled Apricot Jam. Our reviewer is Alan Cheuse.
