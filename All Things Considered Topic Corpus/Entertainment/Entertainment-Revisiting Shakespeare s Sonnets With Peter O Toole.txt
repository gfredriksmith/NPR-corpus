 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Melissa Block.  And I am Robert Siegel. It is time for me to chuck in the sponge. That is how the legendary actor Peter O'Toole began a statement announcing that he is retiring from films and stage at age 79. O'Toole who famously played Hamlet King Henry II and Lawrence of Arabia among dozens of roles  It is my belief that one should decide for oneself when it is time to end one's stay. So I bid the profession a dry-eyed and profoundly grateful farewell.  Well that news sent me back to an interview I did with Peter O'Toole five years ago. We talked about how he first got into acting in the '50s. He would been serving in the Royal Navy.   And so a career was born. Now speaking of poetry the most memorable part of our conversation had to do with Shakespeare in particular with Shakespeare's sonnets.    And you are going to remember that last couplet as soon as you leave the studio I know.  And yet I believe my love more fair than any she belied with false compare. There.  Done.  Not a very good couplet is it?   That is probably why I cannot remember it.  I love that Robert. Now ready for the part of this that really still makes me smile?  This does not make you smile already?  They all make me smile but I love this part in particular.  All right.  Are you ready?  Yes.    I love that.
