 Well commentator and comedian Maz Jobrani has been giving Iran's internet plans some thought and he says it is a golden opportunity.  Mr. Ahmadinejad your first move for your Iranian-only Internet is to buy Facebook. You like bargains right? Well even with those nasty sanctions in place what a deal. Facebook's plummeting IPO price makes it attractive. You can rename it Farsibook if you like. Second you need an Iranian Twitter. One problem with names like Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and Grand Ayatollah Syyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei 140 characters as not gonna work. Next you need a thing with maps. Of course there will be certain locales like nuclear facilities - I mean peaceful electrical plants - that you want to hide from view especially Israeli eyes. So it will have limitations. Then there is a need for an Iranian online dating service. It would involve one man one woman the woman's father mother uncles aunts - match my family with your family.com. Straights only need apply. Books? Ramazon.com. Travel site? How about goodluckgettingavisa.com. You see when you cut off the rest of the world's Internet the opportunities to prosper are endless.  Maz Jobrani Iranian-American and founder of the Axis of Evil Comedy Tour.
