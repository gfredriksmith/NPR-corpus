 Time magazine once called Jonathan Franzen the Great American novelist who shows us the way we live now. Well agree or not Franzen is one of the most talked about American writers and today his latest book is out. It is called Purity. Roxane Gay has this review.  Pip Tyler is a recent college graduate living in Oakland Calif. She is smart ambitious and saddled with student debt - your typical millennial. We meet Pip her overbearing mother a kind of WikiLeaks-like German activist named Andreas Tom a journalist and his ex-wife Anabel. There is a murder in East Germany complications secrets are revealed. What Franzen does well is to create an ambitious sprawling story with great tension. Unfortunately that compelling narrative is lost in a lot of self-indulgent nonsense. Two of the characters - Andreas and Anabel - are so over the top they seem farcical. Anabel is a feminist the worst kind the author would have us believe who makes her husband pee sitting down. She is so over the top it is like she belongs in a different book one about profound mental illness. Andreas the hacker activist is self-absorbed. It is only toward the end of the novel that we really see how troubled he is but by then his narcissism makes it hard to care. There are moments where Purity seems to reach frantically for the zeitgeist. It offers critiques of feminism the Internet and other aspects of the way we live now. Franzen is offering an earnest but narrow and privileged assessment of our world. The shame of Purity is that the real purity in this novel is the author's passive aggressive contempt for nearly all his characters.  The book is Purity Jonathan Franzen. It was reviewed by Roxane Gay author of Bad Feminist.
