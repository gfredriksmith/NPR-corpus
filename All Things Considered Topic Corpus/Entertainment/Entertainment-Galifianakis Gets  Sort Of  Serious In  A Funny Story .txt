 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  And I am David Greene. And we end this hour with a movie about a young patient in an adult mental hospital. But as the name says It is Kind of a Funny Story. And that is due in large part to one of the funniest actors working today Zach Galifianakis. He plays Bobby himself a patient but also a mentor to the film's young hero. Here's Bobby doing a bit of role-playing.  Mr.   You can practice on me. Mr.   Practice what? Mr.   Asking Noelle out. Mr.   Uh no. That is okay. Mr.   I will be Noelle. I will be Noelle. Mr.   No. Mr.   I am Noelle. Uh hey Craig how is it going? Mr.   Hey Noelle. I am well. How are you? Mr.   Oh good. I get out of here soon. This is pretty cool. Do you like music? Mr.   Yeah sure. Mr.   I like live music. Uh you are just gonna sit there the whole time you are asking her out? Stand up. I am a lady.  Galifianakis' part in this film is an exercise in understatement compared to the role that catapulted him to stardom - as Alan in last year's surprise hit The Hangover.  Mr.   Phil there is a tiger in the bathroom. Mr.   What is going on? Mr.   There is a jungle cat in the bathroom. Mr.   Okay okay. Al Al. Mr.   Do not go in. Mr.   I will check it out. Mr.   Do not go in. Do not go in. Be careful. Do not do not.  Mr.   Oh he is not kidding. There is a tiger in there. Mr.   Yeah.  And the man with no pants actor Zach Galifianakis joins us from New York. And Zach welcome to the program. Mr.  Thank you. Thanks for having me.  Thank you for endangering my marriage man. I really appreciate it. I saw The Hangover nine times and... Mr.  Oh.  ...my wife really got a kick out of that when I missed the dinners and so forth. So that is great. Thanks. Mr.  Nine times really?  Is that a record? Mr.  I have seen it 710 I think.  Okay. Mr.  No I have only seen it only once I think.  Mr.  It is too embarrassing. I do not want to watch it again. It is also ruined my life.  Why do you say that? Mr.  Well everywhere I go it is like you know I am trying to have a nice peaceful walk. Hey are not you the fat guy from The Hangover? It is never are not you the guy from The Hangover? It is always an insult - but no it is a very funny movie. I am very happy to be a part of it.  So your new film It is Kind of a Funny Story is actually not as funny? Mr.  No. I mean it is not supposed to be. It is a coming-of-age story as they say about a 17-year-old - a 16-year-old - 16- 17-year-old who is in a mental hospital with adults. So I play his mentor who is there for six suicide attempts.  And you actually visited a real psychiatric ward to do some research before playing a suicidal man in his 30s. Mr.  I visited two before even hearing about the movie. No I did. I was in New Mexico and I went to a couple of facilities there and just kind of asked questions and listened. And in some cases it is hard to tell from the people that are working there that are - people that are patients which I thought was interesting. There was this one woman a young woman I was convinced was a patient. She said oh you know - after talking to her she is like you want to step in my office and talk about some more things? It is like oh my gosh she is an administrator. But lovely lovely people. And it is a little bit of a serious - obviously - topic where people are struggling and have some chemical problems going on. And I have never been into a mental facility so it was interesting to watch.  You have done the - sort of the movie festival scene for this new film It is Kind of a Funny Story. Are people accepting you as a serious actor? Are you still getting The Hangover jokes when you wander the halls? Mr.  People are not accepting me period about anything. I mean I had a hard enough time getting into the parties.  Mr.  I do not know - yes I have not felt any - no fat boy you are not allowed into this serious realm. So no everybody is - I think people like to see when comics kind of can take a different role. It' Dramatic actors get to play funny guys sometimes but then when like a comedic actor tries to be serious people are like hey what is this guy doing? And I have never understood that you know?  Right. Mr.  I do not think the comedian-serious role has the respect that it deserves sometimes. I do not know.  You grew up in North Carolina. Mr.  I did.  You own a 60-acre farm there now. Mr.  Yeah.  Do you need all that space? What do you do there? Mr.  I have a Shakespeare festival for one.   No but - I mean does North Carolina still draw you? Is that an important space for you to kind of return to? Mr.  Yeah I really appreciate being there. I drive around in my tractor. I do my chores. I chop my wood. And I think. It is a good place to think. And there is some moonshine involved. And there really is nothing to do. I mean I do not have a television. I just play in my basement. There is not much to do but it is a place to get away from the very self-involved business of being an actor.  And growing up you - as I have read - were kind of the family goofball. I mean were you testing out your stand-up for your parents your siblings? Mr.  Well I do not know if I was the family goofball. My brother and in fact my sister are funnier than I am. So I was the one trying to orchestrate - we used to do sketches for my parents where we would you know the theme would be the Iran-Contra affair...  Mr.  ...which is you know a very great place to mine for comedy especially when you are...  Sure. Mr.  ...9 years old. But...  How did that sketch play out? Mr.  I think - if I remember my sister was dressed as the shah of Iran. I do not remember who my brother was but I was a news reporter. And I remember my parents were dressed up. They were going out for the evening and they were just laughing. They were sitting on the couch in their nice clothes laughing. And that was it. And then they would leave us alone no babysitter. And then my brother would beat the crap out of me.  As part of the sketch or just for the heck of it? Mr.  Hey I think that was his own sequel that he...  Mr.  ...had in his mind. Oh yeah you forgot to write this part Zach.  Right. Let me beat you up now. Mr.  Yeah yeah.  Well Zach I - you have - I mean you have been doing comedy and your work is well-respected for a long time but Hangover certainly gave you this huge jump. I mean what is it like to sort of get that jump into stardom at sort of a later stage in your career - you know 40 - not you know 20? Mr.  I have thought about it. And I am probably pretty lucky that it happened later because you know if I were 25 I may have ended up buying you know seven Dodge Vipers...  And who wants to own seven Dodge Vipers? Mr.  I know when you can buy nine.  Mr.  Life has not changed. I mean it has changed but I am too old to buy into the hype.  I want to be so famous I have never told the truth again. And...  Mr.  ...you know I think that is a very poisonous way to live. Now having said that I mean there are inconveniences. I mean my niece who is 3 years old just asked for 10000. So...  And you said? Mr.  I am not going to support that habit. And I cannot tell you what that habit is.  I will not ask. Mr.  She is addicted to pacifiers with honey.  Okay. Mr.  Dipped in honey.  Yeah you do not want to back that habit. Mr.  It is terrible.   Keep the 10000 for the Dodge Vipers. Mr.  Yeah.  Actor Zach Galifianakis thanks so much for joining us on NPR. I hope it is been fun for you. Mr.  Thanks for having me. Thank you very much.    You spin my head right round right round...  Zach Galifianakis' new movie is called It is Kind of a Funny Story.    You spin my head right round right round when you go down when you go down down...  Hello? Hello? Zach? Mr.  Yes hi.  This is David Greene. Mr.  Hi David. It is Zach Galifianakis.  This is very exciting. Mr.  For who? For - I mean yes. Yes it is.   I am assuming for me. Mr.  It - no no no. For me. You do not understand - like this is - I cannot believe that NPR wants to chat. But I am very excited.  Why cannot you believe that? Mr.  Because do not you guys have dignitaries on and people that are talking about evolution and the environment and you want somebody that comes on and tells somewhat funny jokes?    You spin my head right round right round when...  No joke. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
