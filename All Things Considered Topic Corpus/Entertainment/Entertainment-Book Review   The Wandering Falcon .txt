 Alan Cheuse has a review of The Wandering Falcon.  And Ahmad's voice like that of an old storyteller of which he writes addressing an intertribal conclave about the consequences of a kidnapping. Ahmad's voice is usually clear and sharp like the sound of plucked strings from a musical instrument.   The book is The Wandering Falcon by Jamil Ahmad. Our reviewer Alan Cheuse teaches writing at George Mason University in Fairfax Virginia.
