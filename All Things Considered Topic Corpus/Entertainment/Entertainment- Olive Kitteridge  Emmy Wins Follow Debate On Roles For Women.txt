  And the Emmy goes to Olive Kitteridge.   Olive Kitteridge is the HBO miniseries that was one of the big winners at last night's Emmy awards. It won six Emmys and left many people tweeting Olive who?  Olive Kitteridge is an adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by the same name. It is about a woman in a small town in Maine wrestling with marriage motherhood and aging. Here's Frances McDormand accepting her Emmy for her performance as Olive.   We are all here because of the power of a story well told. Sometimes that is enough.  McDormand spoke with NPR's Melissa Block last year and explained why this story deserved to be told as a miniseries.   Female characters in literature are full. They are messy. They have got runny noses and burp and belch. In - unfortunately in the - in film female characters do not often have that kind of richness. Four hours was just enough. Six hours would have been better.  In a time when Hollywood does not have a lot of rich roles for older women last night's Emmys were seen as an affirmation. Frances McDormand told NPR she hoped her role would inspire actors of all ages.   One of the reasons that I am doing press again after 10 years absence is because I feel like I need to represent publicly what I have chosen to represent privately which is a woman who is proud and more powerful than I was when I was younger. And I think that I carry that pride and power on my face and in my body. And I want to be a role model. I want to be an elder. I want to be an eldress.   Frances McDormand speaking to NPR's Melissa block last fall about her title performance in HBO's Olive Kitteridge. McDormand won an Emmy for that portrayal last night. The series won six awards in total.
