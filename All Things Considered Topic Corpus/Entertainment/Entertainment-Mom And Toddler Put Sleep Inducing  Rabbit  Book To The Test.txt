 Every so often a genuine publishing phenomenon emerges. The latest one is no Harry Potter but the reason for its meteoric rise to the top of Amazon's best-seller list is self-evident. The cover makes this promise - I can make anyone fall asleep. It is a promise that sleep-deprived parents cannot resist and one that NPR's Lynn Neary put to the test.  If you are a parent looking for that magic switch which will put your child to sleep Carl-Johan Forssen Ehrlin thinks he can help. He is the Swedish a psychologist who wrote and self-published The Rabbit Who Wants To Fall Asleep. At the moment he is also the second-most popular author on Amazon just behind perennial best-seller James Patterson. Sleep expert Suzy Giordano says Ehrlin has a built-in audience of desperate parents.  They will go to anyone or anything that promises them having your baby sleeping .  The book tells the story of a rabbit named Roger who wants to go to sleep but cannot. It is not the most compelling story - which seems to be the point - and it is not just the story that is designed to put a child to sleep it is also the way a parent reads the book. It includes instructions about when to emphasize certain words or when to slow down. It even suggests that parents yawn here and there while reading it.  We are going to go upstairs and sit in your room and read a book.  A book.  We are going to read a book.  Yeah a book.  We figured we needed a real child to get a sense of how this might work so we dropped in on Karen Loeschner as she put her 2-year-old son Kai down for his afternoon nap. At first Kai seemed to be falling under the book's spell.   Roger could play in the park all day long until he fell asleep on the swings. Now it allows him to swing back and forward back and forward slowly relaxing.  That quiet spell did not last long.  I want truck book. I want truck book.   All the sounds he could hear made him and you Kai even more and more tired.  I want truck.  Kai got up went to the bookcase found his favorite truck book and climbed back on his mother's lap. Karen gamely continued down the rabbit path.   I am going down to visit uncle Jan...  .   ...Because he will help me fall asleep now.  .  OK so the book did not really work for Kai. And to be fair there was a strange woman with a microphone lurking in the background. Even so - his mom says the book just did not grab him.  Number one - it is too long. I mean he is 2. You know the attention span is not where this book needs him to be. And you know it is real wordy. There is hardly any pictures so there is nothing for him to look at. He just sees text and is like oh what am I going to do with that?  Sleep expert Suzy Giordano says the book is meant to be hypnotic and may work better with older kids. She suggests parents practice reading the book a couple of times and then make it part of their routine.  You know so the story can flow in a way that it is intended to with the understanding that OK I am trying to relax my child to a state of complete calmness so they can fall asleep.  Oh and for what it is worth Karen Loeschner read Kai two truck books after I left and he went right to sleep. Lynn Neary NPR News Washington.
