 Well that difference between disasters as they unfold in movies and the real thing got our film critic Bob Mondello thinking.  Unidentified Man 1   No no no no no.     In the Gulf of Mexico tonight on this Day 95 of the oil spill crisis...  Unidentified Man 2   You are not going to make it.    Disaster fiction won' If you start with your catastrophe you have got nowhere to go except cleanup and where is the fun in that? So directors start by introducing victims we would normally meet only after they have been dodging tidal waves or meteors or whatever. And putting warning signs everywhere.    Unidentified Man 4   Somebody turn of the damned alarm.    This is what Alfred Hitchcock meant when he said suspense is the audience knowing something the characters do not.   Unidentified Man 6   It is perfectly normal.   One plane colliding with one twin tower. Eighteen minutes later - oh my God.   Oh my God.  I am Bob Mondello.
