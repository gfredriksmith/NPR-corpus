 In her seventh novel Glorious Brooklyn-based writer Bernice McFadden takes up the life of a Southern black woman who becomes for a brief moment a central figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Alan Cheuse has our review.  Easter Bartlett is Georgia-born. In her formative years in the early 20th century she discovers amidst her life of rural poverty and violence a love of reading and writing. She also witnesses some of the worst of racist culture in the South. She sees her sister violated and her father unable to raise his head in protest. She sees a lynching and by the time she is an adolescent attracted to both women and men she finds herself traveling with a hoochie-koochie dancer from a carnival named Rain. Her reading leads to work as a schoolteacher but Easter becomes pregnant by one of her students and with a little help from friends flees north to Harlem. There she takes a day job in a beauty salon and seriously begins her vocation as a writer. Her life echoing some aspects of the lives of Zora Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen blossoms in amazing and painful fashion just as the cultural movement we know as the Harlem Renaissance comes into bloom. McFadden tells Easter's story with zest and affection as when she first falls under dancer Rain's magnetic spell or when she first sees Harlem where the air McFadden writes is sticky sweet and peppered with perfume sweat sex curry salt meat sauteed chicken livers and fresh-baked breads. The streets teem with automobiles streetcars and horse-drawn wagons. On the street corners young boys cry - extra extra read all about it. Now and then McFadden usually quite straightforward in her language embraces cliches and in the final chapters she allows her plot to escape her loving hold on it. But despite all that extra extra you want to read all about Easter.  The novel is Glorious by Bernice McFadden. Our review is from Alan Cheuse who teaches writing at George Mason University.
