 And finally today we have been asking our guests to share what they would recommend you watch or read to help you understand the current moment. Here are a couple to get you started.  Hello. My name is Brendon Ayanbadejo. I am a former Super Bowl champion with the Baltimore Ravens and an activist for LGBTQ rights and civil rights. There is an amazing book I recommend you to read. It is called White Fragility by Dr. Robin DiAngelo. It will change your life no matter what ethnicity what race what gender you are. It is a game changer.  My name is Aurora James. I am the founder of the brand Brother Vellies. And I think you should read All About Love by bell hooks. Right now it is so important that we sort of focus in on the things that matter to us the most and growing positivity and communicating through a space of love. And bell hooks is an incredible incredible person to learn about that from.  That was Aurora James and Brendon Ayanbadejo.
