 One of the stranger comedies at Sundance this year will soon be at a theater near you. It is casually known as Daniel Radcliffe's farting corpse movie. The actual title is Swiss Army Man. In a moment we will hear from the film's directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Sheinert. First here's Bob Mondello with his review.  Hank is shipwrecked on a tiny island and is placing a noose around his neck to end it all when he spots something washed up on the beach. It looks like a person.    Hey are you OK?  It is a person. It is in fact Daniel Radcliffe. But he is not OK. He is dead. He is also rather disconcertingly making noises. We are maybe 12 minutes in as directors Kwan and Sheinert make the leap from realism to fantasy. They have Hank who is played with a sort of exuberant melancholy by Paul Dano harness the body's flatulence riding it as if it were a motor boat from the island to more hospitable shores. There he discovers the body has as many usefully fantastical properties as a Swiss army knife. It is a source of fresh drinking water and a compass of sorts using an appendage I cannot talk about on the radio. And also with gas escaping from its mouth as well as from other orifices Hank starts imagining it might keep him company.    Talk to me please. OK buddy?  And he does talk.    OK buddy.  .  And Hank punches him.    Why did you hit me?   I thought you were dead.   Am I dead?   I do not think so. You are talking. Or I am just hallucinating from starvation.  Possible - which does not keep the conversation from going to places most conversations do not as the once-suicidal Hank explains living to his lifeless buddy. And Radcliffe by the way is giving an amazingly physical performance as he is tossed and rolled and jackknifed around. The thing that Swiss Army Man makes clear is that it is precisely the things people do not talk about that make life life and worth living. I am Bob Mondello.
