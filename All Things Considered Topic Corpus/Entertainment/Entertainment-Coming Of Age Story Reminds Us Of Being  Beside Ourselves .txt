 Our book reviewer Alan Cheuse has been reading a new novel about a family. It is called We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves. The book explores childhood child-rearing sibling love and rivalry profound if familiar topics. But one aspect of this family is highly unusual.  The Cookes of Bloomington Ind. are made up of dad and mom  Rosemary her brother Lowell and the youngest offspring in the house. She is named Fern. Together they are engaged in a home life experiment under the auspices of a major American university's psychology department. The thing is Fern - whom young Rosemary regards almost as a twin - is an African-born chimpanzee. When Fern gets untimely taken from them in part because of a nasty childish trick played by Rosemary the family gets torn apart. Rosemary our narrator - who is a 22-year-old college student as the novel opens - has tried throughout her adolescence to keep her monkey sister private. She is twisted her own story and life into a pretzel to avoid admitting what she takes to be odd and damaging news about herself and her background. As a result she is not a happy person distancing herself from friends and occasional lovers longing to see her estranged brother Lowell again - seems he is run off to join up with the Animal Liberation Front - and emotionally drained from her efforts to come to terms with family.  What is freedom? What is captivity? What is animal and what is human? By the time you get to the last section of the novel which is absolutely sublime I have to tell you you will feel as though Rosemary and Fern are your own siblings. And you too may be - as I was - completely beside yourself with a mixture of misery and joy.  Alan Cheuse reviewed We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves by Karen Joy Fowler.
