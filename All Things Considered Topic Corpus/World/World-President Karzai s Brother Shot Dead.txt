 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Michele Norris.  Afghanistan is bracing for the repercussions of an assassination today. Ahmed Wali Karzai the president's half-brother was shot to death this morning. He was the head of Kandahar's provincial council and he was widely acknowledged as the most powerful man in that province. He had a hand in security reconstruction and allegedly Kandahar's massive opium trade as NPR's Quil Lawrence reports.  President Karzai repeatedly defended his brother claiming there was no solid evidence of corruption. Ahmed Wali Karzai himself denied any wrongdoing in repeated interviews like this one with NPR.   And if anyone has any evidence of corruption or whatever you call it please they should bring it over.  Today President Karzai had scheduled a joint press conference with visiting French President Nicolas Sarkozy which he went through with despite just having heard the news.  .
