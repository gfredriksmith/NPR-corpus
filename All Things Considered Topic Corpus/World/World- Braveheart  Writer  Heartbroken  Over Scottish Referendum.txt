 So a sad day for backers of the movement for an independent Scotland.  But Scots have been in a corner before.    They may take our lives but they will never take our freedom.  This is the battlefield speech from the film Braveheart depicting this 13th century Scottish hero.    I am William Wallace.  And I am Randall Wallace screenwriter of the 1995 film Braveheart. When I got the news of the referendum I was heartbroken - still am. I was really hoping that they would choose the path of independence.  Those in Scotland nursing an emotional letdown today may have Wallace Randall Wallace to blame for raising their hopes so high for independence. It seems the movie he wrote Braveheart is a cultural touch point. We have talked with a pollster who referred to the Braveheart generation many just 30 to 50 who were the most ardent supporters of Scottish independence. Randall Wallace simply calls these fans Bravehearts.  I believe the people who have really responded to the movie have seen in that story an affirmation of a heart of courage. And courage means facing fear. Courage means facing difficulty. That is what it means to me.  So it seems we could all be Bravehearts with or without the kilt.  Scotland forever Alba gu brath.
