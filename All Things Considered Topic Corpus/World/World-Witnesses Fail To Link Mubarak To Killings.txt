 As NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports witness after witness failed to connect Mubarak or his interior minister to the fatal shootings of protestors earlier this year.  What prosecutors expect to hear from these high-ranking officials is unclear. But the summonses have renewed hope in lawyers representing Egyptians who want to see Mubarak and his former interior minister Habib al-Adly convicted. They say the judge's action proves that despite the flimsiness of the prosecution's case the court is taking the charges seriously.    That officer a police captain and others who have testified say they received no orders from on high to shoot to kill or to use live ammunition against the protestors. But the captain contradicted an earlier affidavit when he testified that he only learned that live ammunition had been used from TV reports.    Outside the court compound the father of one 10-year-old boy who was fatally shot was also unhappy.    Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson NPR News Cairo
