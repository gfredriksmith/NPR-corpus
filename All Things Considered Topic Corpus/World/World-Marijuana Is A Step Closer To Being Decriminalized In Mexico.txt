 Mexico's Supreme Court says public health laws that forbid personal use of marijuana are unconstitutional. This ruling is the latest from Mexico's high court in a long-running standoff with lawmakers who have been dragging their feet on decriminalizing pot. As NPR's Carrie Kahn reports from Mexico City proponents of recreational use of marijuana are not celebrating quite yet.  Twenty-five-year-old Sergio Valenti is getting ready to go to work. He drives tourists around downtown Mexico City. But first he is rolling a joint.  .  I am going to smoke a fat one Valenti says in a small park right in front of Mexico's federal Senate building. Proponents of marijuana legalization have been growing pot in this plaza and lighting up for more than a year. While many like Valenti are glad the Supreme Court ruled that marijuana use is a constitutional right he complains that lawmakers still have not passed the necessary laws to make sure that right is respected.  .  For me it is like it is still not legal. Nothing is legal yet says Valenti. And he is right. Mexico's high court said yesterday that two federal health laws banning personal consumption and home cultivation are unconstitutional but they left criminal penalties in place. Frida Ibarra of the nongovernmental group Mexico United Against Crime says there is not the political will to fully decriminalize marijuana.  .  We need to redirect government resources she says and fight real crimes and criminals in Mexico like kidnappers and murderers not small-time marijuana users. Protester Pepe Rivera lives in a tent in the pot plaza with his dog Gallo slang for joint in Spanish and his two chickens Mari and Juana. He says lawmakers continue to ignore the Supreme Court.  Because they do not understand that it is a human rights issue.  He says the country must stop treating marijuana like it is a problem. Carrie Kahn NPR News Mexico City.
