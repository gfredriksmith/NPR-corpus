 Melissa Block is in Brazil this week bringing us stories about the upcoming World Cup and the Olympics and about the rapidly expanding middle class in Brazil. Well now Melissa brings us an audio postcard from the streets of northeastern Brazil where traffic public safety and performance art collide.    So we are here on a busy avenue in the city of Olinda outside Recife in northeast Brazil. This is Avenue President Kennedy. And I am here with two gentlemen who are wearing brightly colored clothes. They have got multicolored wigs and hats sunglasses red noses.    What are your names?        Uncle Honk. Why is he named...   Fom Fom.  Fom Fom? Fom Fom.  Fom Fom.  Uncle Honk and Fom Fom are traffic clowns.    Where is your helmet they shout as a motorcyclist whizzes by.    Pull down your visor. Fasten your seatbelts.    These clowns or palhacos are hired by the city of Olinda to make the ever-growing traffic here a bit safer or at least more fun.    We try to bring peace to the traffic Uncle Honk tells me. Respect the driver near you. The bigger car should look out for the smaller one. And Fom Fom chimes in.    Our motto is kindness breeds kindness.    The clowns lean into traffic on this four-lane divided road  a big thumbs up for a helmet a cross-body sweep of the arm to mime fastening a seat belt. And then there is the clown semaphore for do not drink and drive.    Aha. OK. So you hold your thumbs up to show like you are drinking and then you use your thumbs to show a steering wheel and then your wag finger in air to say do not do that.    OK. More or less. So when you make a gesture to a driver do you get some gestures directed back at you?    There are always some drivers who are not educated or are not polite says Uncle Honk. So sometimes they do respond with obscene gestures. But he says we are not here to argue or fight.    Uh-oh. Trouble. Fom Fom spots a girl jaywalking against the light and clutches his heart.    Oh my God he shrieks. You are trying to kill me. That was a scare.    As we are talking horses clop by pulling farmers on rickety wooden carts filled with vegetables. They trot side by side with the zooming buses and trucks. Brazil is a country with one foot in the agrarian past the other planted firmly in the industrial present. And as millions of people here have been lifted out of poverty into the lower rungs of the middle class many are now buying cars for the first time.    Uncle Honk explains a few years ago here in Brazil the government cut the tax on cars so people who always dreamed of having a car are now able to buy one. What that means is a tremendous jump in the number of cars on the roads more inexperienced drivers a big traffic mess and lots of work for these traffic clowns.     Fom Fom muito obrigada. Thank you so much.    Thank you.   Our co-host Melissa Block out with a couple of traffic clowns in the streets of Olinda in northeastern Brazil.
