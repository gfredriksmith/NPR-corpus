 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Melissa Block.  As NPR's Kelly McEvers reports the statement is one of the most detailed accounts of the government crackdown since the Syrian uprising began in March.  In the video Adnan Mohammad al-Bakkour wears a light blue sport coat and sits behind a desk.    He says he has information that 72 anti-government protesters were killed in detention on July 31st. That was the first day of the so-called Ramadan offensive in Hama when troops and tanks rolled into a city that had been a center of protest. Bakkour says he also knows about more than 400 protesters who were killed by security forces and left in mass graves in public parks. He says he was asked to prepare a report saying the victims were killed by armed gangs.    He says thousands of protesters have been detained hundreds of these have been tortured. And he says the army destroyed homes in Hama while people were still inside. Then in perhaps the most shocking segment of the video he names names.    The minister of interior and various officers in the military and intelligence agencies men he says are directly responsible for the deaths. He says he will provide documents and witnesses at a later time.  Never think that God is oblivious to what the unjust are doing.    Bakkour then issued another video statement. It was first broadcast on the Saudi-owned TV network Al Arabiya. Bakkour wears the same sport coat - this time with no tie.    Kelly McEvers NPR News Beirut.
