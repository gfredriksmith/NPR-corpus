 Eleanor Beardsley has the story.  Eight suicides have taken place since the beginning of the summer alone. One young woman jumped from her office window another man hung himself in his cubicle.   Fifty-two-year-old Gauthier Rollin has been employed by the company for 20 years. He says the work environment has been unbearable since France Telecom was privatized a decade ago.   France Telecom has spent its time breaking up teams and breaking down solidarity. They cultivate individualism and selfishness so the support you might have found amongst your colleagues in difficult times is not there. France Telecom manages its employees like cattle.  A former state monopoly France Telecom was deregulated in 1998 and now competes on the world market. It has undergone several major reorganizations in recent years and cut 22000 jobs in the last two. But company officials say those were voluntary departures and that the firm has avoided the mass layoffs of other telecom giants.   France Telecom's chief executive Didier Lombard is facing calls to stand down. There are also calls for an inquiry into working conditions blamed for pushing staff over the edge. Lombard was booed as he arrived at headquarters yesterday and talked to reporters.   The pressure is necessary because we have to compete on the world market. But there is a way to be more humane in doing so.  Workplace lawyer Christophe Mesnooh thinks they may be linked to France Telecom's specific situation.   Because of France Telecom's change in status from a public company to a private firm subject to free-market forces the management have the heavy task of explaining this new world to its employees. And the irony is that the company has communicated much better with the market and its competitors than with its own employees.  For NPR News I am Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.
