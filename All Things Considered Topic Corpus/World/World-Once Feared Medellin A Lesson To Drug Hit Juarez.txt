 NPR's John Burnett traveled to Juarez and has this story.  Last night Juarez residents traumatized by violence packed a ballroom to hear Sergio Fajardo deliver a speech entitled From Fear to Hope. The 53-year-old former mayor of Medellin is running for president of Colombia.  .  There the children of factory workers and poor immigrants from the interior have few opportunities for positive activities or decent wages. So they are drawn into the ranks of the narco mafias as drug mules and assassins all of them expendable. The deployment of 8000 Mexican soldiers to Juarez seems to have done little to reduce the violence.  .  There is every reason not to fight for your city Fajardo said. There is fear hopelessness uncertainty but no matter how dark the night Medellin never surrendered. Thousands of citizens have fled Juarez to avoid the mayhem which ranges from gruesome cartel-on-cartel violence like beheadings to kidnappings and extortions of everyday business people. Fajardo was invited to speak by Juarez Strategic Plan a 10-year-old civic organization that is trying to save the city. The director is Lucinda Vargas.  It is really in our hands to not surrender not lose hope because like he said to the extent that you lose hope and that you start separating the city and emptying the city that is the ripest fuel for violence to continue to grow.  If Medellin did it so can Juarez Sergio Fajardo concluded to a sustained standing ovation.   John Burnett NPR News El Paso.
