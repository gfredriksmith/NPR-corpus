 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. There is no relief in sight for the people of Moscow. They are suffering under both record high temperatures and wildfires that have blanketed the city in smoke. Some Russian officials say the number of people dying each day in Moscow has doubled thanks to the heat and smog which contains high levels of carbon monoxide and other poisonous fumes. Seniors young children and people with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk. Peter Van Dyk reports from Moscow.  The Russian capital set another temperature record today passing 90 degrees yet again for the hottest August 9th on record. The two- month heat wave is taking its toll. The head of the city's health department says around 700 bodies are arriving at city morgues every day. That is double the normal number Andrei Seltsovky told a press conference and he blames the heat and the smog.    The main problem right now Seltsovky says is overheating which particularly affects people with high blood pressure and pre-existing heart conditions and this is even worse he adds when it is combined with the smog. Russia's emergencies minister says the situation with the fires is now much better and they have been almost completely extinguished in five of the worst hit regions. But Moscow and the surrounding region is still blanketed with smoke so it is no wonder people are trying to escape. Most summers they go to the countryside surrounding the capital to cool off but this year the fires mean that is hardly an option.  In this heat my baby covered of red spots and every child on the playground is like that because of heat.  Tatyana Nivinskaya like the vast majority of people in Moscow has no air-conditioning at home so she is taken refuge in a hotel just up the street from her apartment with her husband and 1-year-old daughter.  It was good because there is air-condition and it is really five minutes from our home but we should run away from our home because of great heat. We could not open the window because of smog and it is very dangerous for a baby.  The hotel is just a temporary measure. The family is off to Turkey in a couple of days for two weeks by the sea. But most Muscovites cannot afford that and the city has now opened rooms in 123 social centers where people can have a break from the heat.    Natalia Uvumuba is the director of one of the centers. She says she is not busy but it is early evening and she is still juggling two calls on her cell phone and a stream of people through her office.   Different people come here. Parents with children the elderly who do not have air conditioners at home. They come here not just to sit where it is cool and rest but also because we have a doctor and a nurse.  Uvumuba says this is not what her center is usually used for but since Sunday staff have been providing tea cold drinks movies and companionship for seniors who live alone. And with the forecast predicting more smoke and unusually high temperatures through the weekend the center is expected to be busy for a while yet. For NPR News I am Peter Van Dyk in Moscow.
