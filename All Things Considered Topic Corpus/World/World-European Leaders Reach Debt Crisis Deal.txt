 Eleanor Beardsley reports.  France and Germany knew they would have to pay the most to save Greece says Philippe Dessertine a professor at the Paris-based High Finance Institute but they disagreed on how the bailout plan should be structured.   French banks are deeply exposed to Greek debt but the German taxpayers would not have accepted the plan that just bailed out the French banks. So Merkel wanted the banks and private investors to be part of the bailout this time.  That is all a reflection of the two leaders' different domestic situations says James Hertling who follows European finance for Bloomberg News.  The whole issue of Germany subsidizing these fiscally weak states is a very big deal in Germany. It is a very unpopular policy. Germany bit the bullet in the '90s when they paid for the reunification and they really feel very strongly about Greece needing to bite the bullet.  Tonight Sarkozy announced a second huge financial bailout for Greece  interest rates will be lowered and payback periods lengthened. Banks and private investors will also contribute billions to the rescue package this time around. Similar terms will be offered to help Ireland and Portugal deal with their debt problems.   We are fully supporting Greece and the euro because it is our historic responsibility to Europe and this common currency. I want to tell the Greek people that we know you are trying and Europe will be by your side. We will not abandon a eurozone member.  For NPR News I am Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.
