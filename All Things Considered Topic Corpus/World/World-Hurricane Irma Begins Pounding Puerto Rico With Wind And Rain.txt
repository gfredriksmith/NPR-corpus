 As destructive as Harvey was Hurricane Irma could be worse. It is a monster and could very well hit South Florida this weekend.  Irma is now a Category 5 hurricane churning through the Caribbean with maximum sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. That is 28 miles per hour higher than the threshold of a Category 5. There is no category 6.  Puerto Rico is under a state of emergency. Rain and wind from the storm began pounding the island this morning. Electricity is already out in some places.   We were trying to collect water in our containers and - to get drinkable and filtered water - to have enough of it because probably we are going to run out of water.  Elena Biamon owns a farm west of San Juan.   We could not do much with the plantation because there is not much that can be done. Our coffee is not ripe yet. We did what we could but a Category 5 I have never lived through.  Also west of San Juan - Jorge Besu. He left the city to ride out the storm at his mother's house with his family. He says they have enough supplies to last a few days.  Twelve gallons of water canned foods that we could also prepare on our propane grill propane gas and ice so we can keep our food cold.  Well I am concerned. I have seen two major hurricanes and they were both Category 3. It was tough going but we weathered it.  Luis Trelles lives in San Juan. He is less concerned about surviving Irma and more concerned with surviving the recovery. He says the island's infrastructure is not in good shape.  Who knows how many months we will go without power without water without Internet. The director of Puerto Rico's power authority already announced that it could be up to four or five months before some areas get their power back.  Trelles adds that Puerto Ricans are resilient. They are hoping for the best and preparing for the worst.
