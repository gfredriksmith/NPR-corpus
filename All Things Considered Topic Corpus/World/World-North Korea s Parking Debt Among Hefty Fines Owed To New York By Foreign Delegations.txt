 Here is another difficulty in the relationship between the U.S. and North Korea - parking tickets. While North Korea does not have an embassy in the U.S. it does have a mission to the United Nations on the East Side of Manhattan. That means cars with diplomatic plates carrying passengers with diplomatic immunity.  Chris Glorioso with WNBC New York did a little digging and...  We tallied up North Korea's parking debt and found this country owes about 156000 to the city of New York.  And North Korea is not alone with all those parking tickets. The WNBC team found New York is owed more than 16 million in back fines from foreign delegations.  Now much of that debt happened before 2002 when the city came to terms with the State Department on parking rules. Glorioso says enforcement is still tricky.  It is a very fine line the State Department has to walk when it comes to yanking someone's diplomatic license plate over what some would consider relatively minor parking issues.  But he is quick to add people who live in New York do not see the issue of parking as minor.
