 The Navy today named the 10 sailors who vanished when the USS John S. McCain collided with an oil tanker this week near Singapore. At the same time the Navy narrowed its search for those still missing. NPR's Greg Myre reports.  The Navy says it is identified the body of just one sailor 22-year-old electronics technician Kenneth Smith from New Jersey. And the Navy has called off the search at sea acknowledging it does not expect to find any survivors among the other nine. Monday's collision punched a large hole in the port side of the McCain flooding several compartments including the living quarters. The ship is docked in Singapore and U.S. Navy and Marine divers are still searching those compartments considered the most likely location of the missing. This was the Navy's fourth accident in Asia this year and the second fatal collision in two months. The Navy's top admiral John Richardson addressed this at the Pentagon this week.   I am sure you all felt the same way that I did just devastated and really just heartbroken at having to deal with this again.  Richardson has ordered all of the Navy's roughly 275 ships to take an operational pause for a day or two to review safety procedures.   So that we can get the lessons learned act on those root causes and move forward improving the way we do business.  He also called for a more comprehensive look at Navy operations. That is expected to take months. Greg Myre NPR News Washington.
