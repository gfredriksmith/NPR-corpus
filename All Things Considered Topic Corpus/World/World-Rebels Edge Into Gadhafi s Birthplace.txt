 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  Soraya what is the latest you have heard about fighting along the coast where you are?  Well we were able to make it all the way to Ras Lanuf. This is of course an important town because there is a refinery there. And that is where we were stopped. The front was about 30 miles from there and what is happening is Gadhafi forces are in a town called - or on the other side of a town called Bin Jawad and they were apparently shelling and rocketing toward Ras Lanuf. So that road was no longer safe and the rebels would not let us move any closer.  You mentioned the refinery there in Ras Lanuf Soraya and that is key here. That is why this area is so highly contested that there are these oil installations there.  But nevertheless at this stage they feel very strongly that they have taken this place for good.  Soraya what was the scene as you drove along these areas along the Mediterranean coast. What did you see?  And in Brega we saw petrol tanks or gas tanks that were actually on fire and it was unclear if they had been shelled or what but they were burning.  Soraya what about the civilian population in these areas that have been so heavily fought over?  And they are very determined to come back and heed the transitional council's calls to come in and help repair help rebuild so that they can get the refineries going. Gas is very difficult to come by here as we discovered today. We were basically stopping friends of the driver and then putting fuel from their tank into our tank just so we could make it back to Ajdabiya.  Okay Soraya. Stay safe. Thanks very much.  You are welcome.  That is NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reporting from eastern Libya.
