 The usually stoic chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel gave a somewhat emotional speech today. She took responsibility for her party's loss yesterday in state elections in Berlin. Voters deserted the Christian Democrats in favor of a new anti-immigrant nationalist newcomer. NPR's Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson reports from Berlin.  Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats came in second in the vote count but just barely. It was not enough for them to keep governing here with the Social Democrats who also had a poor showing despite coming in first.   .  The chancellor called the outcome bitter. She blamed herself for this and other recent protest votes over her refugee policy.   .  But she said anyone who does not want to take in foreigners especially Muslims can forget it. Her defiance is unlikely to win back supporters who are turning to the anti-immigrant anti-Muslim Alternative for Germany or AfD. AfD now has seats in 10 of Germany's 16 state legislatures despite allegations of anti-Semitism and ties to far-right extremists against some party officials. Georg Pazderski who is AfD's leader here lauded his party's success as a win for German democracy.   .  He said clearly we speak the language of regular German citizens and workers. It is a connection AfD leaders hope will land them in the next German parliament. Soraya Sarhaddi Nelson NPR News Berlin.
