 A team of U.S. officials is now helping Haiti investigate who killed the country's president last week. But despite calls from Haiti's interim government for security assistance the U.S. is not currently pledging military support. Security is the top issue for many Haitians right now according to Yvens Rumbold. He is director of communications for Policite a public policy think tank in Haiti. He says many Haitians remain suspicious of international peacekeeping intervention but he also rarely leaves his house because street violence has grown drastically in the last three years.  Well it is mostly gangs against gangs but also gangs against the population. Because like last week there was a nurse who was helping someone in an ambulance and she was shot to death. And this is a true fear because so many people have died. We have like - for the last three years at least 470 people have died due to the violence and massacres in the neighborhoods and 83 people have disappeared. So it is not like only because of the political vacuum. We are not sure if the national police can stand against the gangs.  Can you talk about what international peacekeeping efforts have been like in Haiti? What is the history there?  Well it is a long and sad history of U.N. and U.S. intervention even France and Canadian intervention in Haiti. We are - we do not have like right now the feeling of satisfaction after all of these interventions. The last one is the U.N. one. That started in 2004 after President Aristide went to exile and it lasted 13 years.  So there is this U.N. mission in 2004 that many Haitians believe brought a cholera outbreak to the country. There was also reports of sexual abuse by U.N. peacekeepers. So would Haitians welcome international peacekeeping support right now or are people too suspicious?  Of course you all know about the cholera outbreak that the U.N. peacekeepers brought to Haiti but this situation has left Haitian very skeptical about any U.N. intervention in the future. You are not going to find the civil society the Haitian civil society the organized groups requesting an intervention whatsoever.  What are you going to be looking for over the next few days and weeks? We started this conversation with you saying that things can unravel quickly.  We do not know. Like what we are hoping for is for the actual people that are fighting for the power in Haiti right now - they can have a consensus to have kind of a transition government so they can lead us to elections. Not this year - it is not going to happen this year but maybe next year or the year after. That is what we are hoping for.  So elections in the next two years you are saying. That is the hope.  Yes that is the hope. We do not think that the actual - this interim government will be able to mobilize the Haitian population to go to vote because they cannot resolve the security problem. The main problem for us right now is the security problem the security issue. If we do not trust the government to organize to resolve the security issue we are not going to trust them in organizing elections in Haiti.  What are people saying in this moment?  All eyes are right now on the assassination of the Haitian president. It is not on COVID. It is not on the food. It is not on the crisis that is going on. It is on the assassination of the president. Like everyone wants to know who was behind the commando who deals with the people that came to Haiti when. And there is kind of a mixed feeling because we do not trust the government. We do not trust it. We do not know if the actual interim government is telling the truth. That is the main problem. And of course because of the incompetence of the Haitian police right now we cannot truly say that all the information that we get from the police is truthful.  Yvens Rumbold thank you so much for speaking with us.  Thank you very much for your time.  Yvens Rumbold is director of communications for Policite a public policy think tank in Haiti.
