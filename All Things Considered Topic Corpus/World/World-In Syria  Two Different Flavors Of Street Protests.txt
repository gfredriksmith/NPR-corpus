 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Melissa Block.  The message to the United States to Syria today...  It is absolutely clear that they Syrian government is running out of time.  NPR's Deborah Amos reports from Damascus that opposition protests were the largest yet as the army and security forces appear to have withdrawn from some provincial cities.   Even the traffic police are gone said Omar Habbab who spoke to NPR by phone.       Government escorts took a group of Western journalist to the neighborhood of Barzeh. They warned that it might be dangerous here after Friday prayers. They said protesters were often armed with knives and with guns.   But these young men were only armed with banners and the determination to oust the regime says Samir - his face wrapped in a scarf he would not give his last name.  Syrian television says that all the people of Syria love Bashar al- Assad but we do not love him at all.  Hossam Rajab was on the street.  We need our freedom. We have some arrested. Why they kill us? Only we need freedom.  He says he is been protesting for 15 weeks.  Yes yes yes yes. Every night if you come here we are here.  Why is today a peaceful protest? Why is there no security here today?  Because you are here.  Hamid and Reem Abdullah a Syrian-American couple visiting Barzeh this summer say the protests have been peaceful all along.  We have seen a bunch of demonstrations and mostly peaceful if not all.  This is not a little number.  Very peaceful...  It is very peaceful yes.  Have you seen it when it was not peaceful?  No. We only heard about it.   Deborah Amos NPR News Damascus.
