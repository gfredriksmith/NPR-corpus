 In Japan today in a huge warehouse engineers watched in anticipation as a countdown began.     A six-story wooden model condominium was shaken by the equivalent of an earthquake. Had that quake been real it would have been a magnitude 7.5 quake. It was a test and it was said to be the largest simulated earthquake ever attempted with a wooden structure. John Van de Lindt of Colorado State University is the project director. And he now joins me from the Japanese city of Miki. And first of all how did that six-story wooden structure fare in the artificial quake?  Well it fared actually very very well. We were expecting to see a little bit more damage. And in fact when we entered the building after the earthquake we saw just hairline cracks and it performed excellently.  I want you to describe the setup. The condo the six-story structure was built on what I gather amounts to a huge table that shakes. Prof.  That is right. It is a steel cube that has a payload capacity that is about two and half million pounds. Our building was approaching about one million pound. The table is about  I think it is about 50 by 65 feet.  And what were you trying to determine? Prof.  We were trying to do two things. We were trying to determine how these types of buildings behave so that we can model them better and then also to validate a new design approach.  A new design approach. Prof.  That is correct. It is something known as performance-based seismic design. We have all the components say you know a hundred 200 components in a building. And if we design each one to basically withstand a certain level of earthquake then we put them all together it does not necessarily mean that the system as a whole is going to respond that same way. In performance-based seismic design we treat it at a system approach. And so we design explicitly to get that performance at the system level.  You are testing the whole not just the sum of the parts here in terms of Prof.  That is right. And we are designing for the whole.  So what did you learn from today's test? Prof.  Well we learned a couple of things. I would say the major thing that we learned is that the design approach we developed in the course of our project over the last four years we validated that. We learned that that does work. And then we learned the light frame wood structures can be designed for a major major earthquake and perform very well. I mean we had almost no damage which is just astounding.  So tell me what is going through your mind as you are about to see a six-story wooden structure that is been built for the test it is on the big shake table in Japan. And for all you know at that moment if things have not been calculated properly you could be looking at a huge woodpile in a few minutes. What is going through your head at that time? Prof.  Well that is actually a very good question because I think what goes through my mind right before the test when you hear the countdown -of course it is in Japanese  10 nine eight all the way down then I start to hear the shake table. I can see the shake table move. The first thing that goes to mind is I look at the base. I look at the roof. And I know the earthquake record so well. I know if you know if it was going to fail I know when it would fail. So there is definitely some nerves that you know I do not know if I hold my breath or not I cannot remember but   Well Professor Van De Lindt thank you very much for talking with us about it. Good luck. Prof.  Okay. Thank you very much.  That is John Van De Lindt of Colorado State University but he spoke to us from Miki Japan where his group just tested a six-story wooden structure on a shake table. It was a simulated earthquake.
