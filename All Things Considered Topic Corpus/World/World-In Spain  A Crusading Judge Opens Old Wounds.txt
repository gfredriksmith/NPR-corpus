 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Michele Norris.  NPR's Sylvia Poggioli has the story.  .  Film director Pedro Almodovar gives voice to Virgilio Leret Ruiz  I was the first person executed in the civil war he says. I had no trial no lawyer and no sentence. My daughters continue to look for me. For how long?   Garzon is a champion of universal jurisdiction the concept that crimes against humanity cannot be amnestied or subject to statutes of limitations. Recently he spoke at the 16th anniversary of the Jewish Community Center bombing in Buenos Aires that killed 85 people. More than anyone else he said investigating judges cannot shirk their responsibilities.   The one who had the resources in his hands and did not use them the one who could have demanded and did not should not be able to escape regardless of time his legal and civil responsibilities. Never again.  Garzon's troubles started when the small far-right group Manos Limpias Clean Hands filed a complaint against him. Miguel Bernard is the group's secretary general.   .  Adolfo Lanos Urghiola is furious with the marchers.  Everything was reconciliation after the democracy. They do not want reconciliation. They want to open the graves. They want everything we do not want.  But Juan Diego Boto a young actor just wants the Spanish government to open up all the mass graves and identify the bodies.  Puri Galano marches with a photograph of her grandparents who disappeared in 1940 one year after the end of the civil war. She says the move against Garzon has energized the movement to account for the tens of thousands killed by the Franco regime.  All we wanted before Garzon got put out was to recuperate our families and to clean their names. He helped us. He helped us to uncover the whole thing.  Sylvia Poggioli NPR News.
