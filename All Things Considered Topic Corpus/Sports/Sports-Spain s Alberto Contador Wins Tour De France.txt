     For the third time Spanish rider Alberto Contador stood at the top of the Tour de France podium and savored his victory.       Juan Carlos Perez traveled from Madrid with his wife and three children.  You have got your Armstrong with the seven times. We got Contador. He is going to beat Armstrong. This guy is going to make eight or nine Tour de France. Wait and see. Vive Espaa.        .  Sports announcers paid tribute to Armstrong today and Armstrong himself said he never felt the love of fans like he did this year.   Frenchman Giselain Desainvalle has just purchased a yellow Livestrong bracelet. He says he admires Armstrong's cancer fight.   And it is because of him that I started following the Tour de France. He is a star and an icon. If the Tour is known throughout the world it is thanks to Lance Armstrong and everyone agrees with that.  For NPR News I am Eleanor Beardsley in Paris.
