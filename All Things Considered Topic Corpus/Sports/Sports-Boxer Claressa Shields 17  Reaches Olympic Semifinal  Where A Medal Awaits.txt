 Yesterday was a historic day for boxing. For the first time ever women competed for Olympic medals in the sport. And today in the ring a boxer we featured on this program back in February a high school student from Flint Michigan.  Well we are going to start with - my name is Claressa Shields. I have been boxing since I was 11.  Independent producers Joe Richman and Sue Jaye Johnson of Radio Diaries followed Claressa as she prepared for and competed in the Olympic boxing trials.  My record is 19 and 0. Yeah undefeated.  Ladies and gentlemen it is my pleasure to introduce...  I have this dream I am in London and it is the finals in the Olympics. I can hear the announcer. I mean they are going to say it like and the first woman Olympian at 165 pounds is Claressa Shields.  Claressa Shields.  Well today in London Shields got one big step closer to that dream. She won her first bout and advanced to the semifinal round the final four in the middleweight category. And that means she is guaranteed a medal because in boxing the two losers in the semifinal round both receive bronze. On Wednesday if Claressa Shields wins she will go on to compete for the gold medal.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
