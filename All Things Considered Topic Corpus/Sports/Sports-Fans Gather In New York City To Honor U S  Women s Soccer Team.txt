 The rock-star week for the U.S. women's soccer team involved some confetti today. The team's World Cup win was celebrated in New York City with a history-making tickertape parade. Brigid Bergin reports from member station WNYC.  Hours before the parade kicked off 11-year-old Erin Burke claimed her spot on Broadway known in New York as the Canyon of Heroes. This is the first tickertape parade for an all-woman sports team and she was not going to miss it.  It is so cool because like they have never had one before. It is like so inspiring.  Her mom Pam Burke drove from New Jersey at six a.m. this morning because her daughter is a soccer player even though she never got to play herself.  You know there was not as many opportunities for me that the girls have now.  You almost sound like you are choked up about it.  . Yeah. It is emotional I guess.  That emotion erupted into excitement.   USA USA.  As a dozen floats carrying all 23 of the team's players round their way from the tip of Manhattan to City Hall Park a flurry of confetti fell from buildings along the route.   Are you ready for a party?  Mayor Bill de Blasio told the crowd when the team brought home that trophy they also brought home a message.   About the strength of women.   And about the need to create a more equal society for all.   Each member of the team took the stage and in another honor each was presented with a key to the city.
