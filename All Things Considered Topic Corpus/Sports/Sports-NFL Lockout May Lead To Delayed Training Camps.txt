 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Michele Norris.  And as Greg Echlin reports with the NFL lockout dragging on St. Joseph and Mankato fear that this is the year that their teams will not be coming to town.   The flood this summer has forced tournaments on this softball field to be canceled. The last thing community leaders here want is the possibility of Chiefs training camp to be in jeopardy because of the lockout.   As a hotelier I can say we need the revenue so it would be fantastic if they would get this figured out.  That is Chris Booher the general manager of a hotel within sight of the Chiefs' indoor training facility. She is also frank about her feelings toward the Chiefs.  As a fan I cannot even imagine I cannot even fathom not having football this fall. It is disheartening.  Missouri Western University economist Patrick McMurry says a summer without Chiefs training camp would make a significant dent in the economy here. His economic impact study showed visitors spent 1.2 million last year in St. Joe.  We had somebody at the Chiefs' camp who lives several states away and they said they are going to keep coming back. This is what they are going to do with their kids is come back. And so there is a snowball effect. The results from the first one were enormously positive. You do not want to let the air out of that balloon.  Jake's Pizza Stadium across the street from the campus has seen its share of fans and players through the years. Restaurant owner Wally Boyer says if the Vikings are a no-show it would leave a considerable void here.  It would have an effect on our business and not only that but just the feeling around Mankato in general that the Vikings come here every year and it is a fun thing and it brings a lot of people to town. And it means a lot for the whole community really and it does mean something for us too but it is huge for this area.  For NPR News I am Greg Echlin.
