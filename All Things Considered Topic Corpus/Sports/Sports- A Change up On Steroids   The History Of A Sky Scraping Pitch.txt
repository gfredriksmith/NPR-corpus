 Now to the world of baseball and an off-speed pitch. And we mean really off-speed.   .  This week in Japan right-hander Kazuhito Tadano of the Nippon-Ham Fighters threw a high and super-slow junk ball. It seemed to flow in the air before falling sharply across the plate and into the catcher's mitt.   .   Not something you see very often but it has a name in baseball. It is the Eephus pitch.  An Eephus pitch is a slowly thrown high-arcing pitch likely to reach an apex of 25 feet or more above the ground between the mound and the plate.  That is Paul Dickson author of the Dickson Baseball Dictionary.  It is a deception. It is like a change-up on steroids. You are sitting there waiting for a fastball or a curveball. You know you are dazzled by this thing.  Paul Dickson says credit for the first Eephus pitch goes to Truett Rip Sewell who played for the Pittsburgh Pirates back in the 1940s.  He had gotten in a hunting accident over the winter and it left some buckshot in his foot. So he started developing alternative pitches and this was one of them.  As to the name Eephus - well it might come from the Hebrew word effess which means zero or nothing.  Dickson believes it was named by Rip Sewell's teammate outfielder Maurice Van Robays. Of Sewell's pitch he reportedly said that is an eephus.  And when asked what he meant by that Van Robays said eephus it as not nothing and that is a nothing pitch.  It is shown up periodically since then often with other names. Yankee Steve Hamilton called it the folly floater.   Oh there is the folly floater. And listen to the crowd.  Sometimes it is called a gondola parachute balloon ball.  And the rainbow pitch says Paul Dickson.  Well whatever you call it the umpire in Japan this week called that Eephus pitch a ball.
