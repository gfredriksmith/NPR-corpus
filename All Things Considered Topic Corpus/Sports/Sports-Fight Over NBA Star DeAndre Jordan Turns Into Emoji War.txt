 NBA free agency is often chaotic even dramatic.  For DeAndre Jordan it was just plain weird.  The 26-year-old center became a free agent after finishing his contract with the Los Angeles Clippers. A few days ago he verbally agreed to go to Dallas to play for the Mavericks. However free agents had to wait until today to sign contracts.  So the Clippers staged an 11th-hour push to keep DeAndre Jordan. And of course this all had to play out on Twitter.  Here's what happened. The Mavericks' Chandler Parsons tweeted an emoji of a plane to announce that he was flying to DeAndre Jordan's house in Houston to ward off any Clippers from coming.  Then the Clippers' J.J. Redick tweeted a car emoji to announce he was driving from Austin.  Cindy Boren is a sports and social media editor for The Washington Post. She watched this unfold in real time.  All of a sudden you started seeing NBA players tweeting emoji of transportation.  An emoji war was on.  Even Clippers vacationing in the Bahamas chimed in.  Then to cap it off Chris Paul tweeted a picture of a banana boat.  Eventually many Clippers did reach Jordan's house by banana boats planes and automobiles.  They holed up there all night. At one point star forward Blake Griffin tweeted a pic of a chair blocking Jordan's front door. Again Cindy Boren.  I think people on Twitter were saying  it looks like the Clippers are sort of holding him hostage.  Or having an NBA slumber party. 01 this morning DeAndre Jordan agreed to a new contract with his old team. Lots of smiley faces for Clippers fans.  And one giant sad-face emoji for Mavericks fans.
