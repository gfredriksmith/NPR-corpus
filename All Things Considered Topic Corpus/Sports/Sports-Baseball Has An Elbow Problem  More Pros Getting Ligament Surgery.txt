 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Arun Rath. So far this baseball season it seems we have been hearing one name more than any other. Tommy John. What is weird is that Tommy John retired from baseball 25 years ago. But in 1974 he was the first player to undergo a new surgical procedure to fix an injured elbow ligament. The Tommy John surgery as it is now known involves taking a tendon from somewhere else in the body or from a cadaver and grafting it into place. Pitchers get it most often but lately the surgery has become so common with amateurs as well as pros that some are calling it an epidemic. I spoke with Rob Neyer of Fox Sports who stopped short of that word. But he says it is still a huge deal.  Last year there were 50 roughly 50 Tommy John surgeries in all of professional baseball - which was a lot. This year there have already been roughly 45.  Lets talk about Sean Burnett the pitcher for the Angels who this week became the latest pitcher to get this kind of surgery. Looking at this picture of him throwing the last pitch before he injured that elbow it looks sick. I do not know if it is something about the angle but it does not look like an elbow should bend like that. He would already had the surgery once. Now he is had it a second time. Is that really smart?  Well it is absolutely true that when you watch a picture in super slow motion or you see a still taken that right split-second it absolutely looks unbelievably unnatural. But they have always basically done this. I just saw a picture of a pitcher in 1910 and he had basically the same pitching motion that pitchers have now. But pitcher today are bigger and stronger than they have ever been before. There is a lot of thought now that you can build up the muscles around the elbow ligament. And that might help. But you cannot strengthen that ligament itself. And what we are doing is creating these giant power pitcher who can throw 95 to 100 miles an hour routinely but we just cannot create an elbow ligament that allows them to do that year in and year out.  That speed you are talking about - is that what is causing them to need the surgery? Do we know what the real reasons are for it?  No we do not. And that is the real tricky thing. And we have a lot of people a lot of really smart people who work for baseball teams all the great doctors who specialize in pitcher. They have not figured it out. There is some thought that you should sort of limit the number of pitches you throw and that is been happening for a long time. I think a lot of people now believe teenagers should not be pitching the year round which many of them do. But nobody's figured out a magic bullet to this point. I do not know that anyone is going to for a long time.  You know when you are talking about teenagers - and we are hearing about teenagers actually having this surgery. How worried should parents be about the way that their kids are throwing baseballs?  They certainly should be very worried. And I think most of them are. When we talk about how do you convince parents not to allow this to happen -it is that - the kids want to throw hard. The kids want to get a college scholarship. They want to get a professional contract. The way you do that is by throwing in exceptionally hard impressing the scouts impressing college coaches. You know what is the incentive to not do those things? It is difficult to say especially when the success rate of these surgeries is very high. Somewhere between 80 and 85 percent of pitchers come back throwing essentially as well as they did before. So there is not a lot of incentive for teenagers for college pitchers young professionals to stop throwing as hard as they have been to throw fewer innings than they have been. There is a lot of incentives to keep doing those things.  That is Rob Neyer senior baseball editor at foxsports.com. Rob thanks so much.  You bet. My pleasure.
