 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  And I am Melissa Block. Now the latest on the story of Caster Semenya. She is the 19-year-old runner from South Africa the 800-meter world champion who is been sitting out of international competition while undergoing gender tests. Well today Semenya was cleared by track's governing body to begin competing again as a woman. NPR's Tom Goldman is following the story. Tom Caster Semenya gets to race again. What do we know about her today that we did not know months ago?  Not much Melissa.  She won the gold medal in the 800 meters at the World Championships in Berlin. That was last August. And other athletes complained that Semenya looked masculine sounded masculine and so track and field's world governing body the IAAF ordered the sex testing. Now today after 10 months of negotiations between medical teams from the IAAF a team representing Semenya presided over by an international mediator we get three lines. And here' The process initiated in 2009 in the case of Caster Semenya has now been completed. The IAAF accepts the conclusion of a panel of medical experts that she can compete with immediate effect. Please note that the medical details of the case remain confidential and the IAAF will make no further comment on the matter.  And does that mean end of story?  What they believe yes. But it leaves us with tons of questions obviously because no medical or sports or governmental officials are commenting. Semenya is not coming out and saying this is what tests they did. This is what is known. And so we can only speculate and ask what did they find out about her gender. We are left to believe the Australian press reports from last year that said tests revealed Semenya has no womb or ovaries. And if I am a future female competitor I have to trust the IAAF decision and move on but will I wonder if I am running against a woman. Now one person I spoke to who is quite knowledgeable about the international track scene said there is the belief Semenya has been getting hormone therapy like other athletes whose gender is ambiguous have gotten in the past. And if this is the case the hormone therapy in short hand womanizing her more will make her less of a dominant athlete the kind of athlete who is getting male times in races.  And Tom this case has been going on as we have said for 11 months. Why has it taken so long?  There are several reasons. One is it is very difficult medically to figure out. Well it is not that easy. Some people are born with ambiguous sexual organs. Some female athletes have been found to have a condition called androgen insensitivity syndrome or AIS where the woman might have a male chromosome but she is not a man because her body does not respond to the testosterone she is producing.  Tom this has also been a very sensitive volatile issue really not just for Caster Semenya and her family but also for the whole country of South Africa.  Oh it is. Yeah. And particularly for the athlete. In 2005 in the medical journal The Lancet a former female Spanish hurdler wrote about her experience where her gender was called into question. Her name is Maria Jose Martinez-Patino. She had sex testing at the age of 22 and she was given a certificate of femininity. A couple of years later she was tested again at the World University Games in Japan. There was a problem and it was announced in front of her teammates and she was crushed.  I was expelled from our athletes' residence. I felt ashamed and embarrassed. I lost friends my fiance hope and energy. So you have a very difficult thing for the athlete.  Tom do you see this case of Caster Semenya leading to any changes in gender policy or testing in the world of sports?  Well certainly there is a ton of talk about it right now. What we are seeing in January the International Olympic Committee talked about setting up special medical centers to deal with cases of athletes with ambiguous sexual characteristics and medical centers around the world. This one official said it is for the experts to decide what to do with each individual case. There is no general treatment. There is no general diagnosis.  That is NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman telling us about the case of Caster Semenya cleared by track's governing body to begin competing again as a woman. Tom thanks very much.  You are welcome.
