Madeleine Brand  And now from women in boxing to women in tennis. Yesterday President Obama awarded the presidential Medal of Freedom to a star-studded cast of people from Sidney Poitier to Chita Rivera to Desmond Tutu also tennis great Billy Jean King.  In his opening remarks the president rattled off her impressive career stats.  What we honor are not simply her 12 Grand Slam titles 101 doubles titles and 67 singles titles pretty good Billie Jean.   Pretty good indeed. The trouble is she was even better than that. It turns out the president flubbed an important number.  Billy Jean King later told a reporter from Politico I was cracking up -not even in the ball park.  Now the president was on the right track. In fact Billy Jean King won 12 Grand Slam singles titles but she has a total of 39 Grand Slam titles.  She shrugged off the presidential miscalculation. She said I thought it was adorable.
