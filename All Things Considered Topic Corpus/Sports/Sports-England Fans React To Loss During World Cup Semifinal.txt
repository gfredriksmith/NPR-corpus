 England faced Croatia today in the last semifinal game of the World Cup. It is the first time since 1990 that England has gotten this far. My co-host Mary Louise Kelly watched the game from a pub in central London or at least she tried.  The weather gods have delivered the most glorious summer night. And apparently the entire city has decided to clock out early and hit the pub so much so that we are being thwarted in our quest to find one where we can watch because they are all already spilling out onto the street about - I would say 20 deep but it is way deeper than that.  My name's John Appleby .  I am Martin Robinson .  I am going to take a wild stab at who you two are rooting for tonight.  Come on England. That is - of course.  I will be nervous as soon as it starts yeah but I am OK at the moment.  The appearance of Team England - we can see them finally on screen walking out in their uniforms.   Southgate youre the one. You still turn me on 'ecause footballs coming home again.   OK. I am back with considerably more lager in my hair and down my back than when I last checked in. I was just in the bar trying to get a better look right when that first England goal went in which as you may have heard was greeted with a little celebration here.   OK. You just heard it fall a little bit quiet. That is because Croatia just equalized - yeah so the score's now tied 1-1. Oh boy - 1-1 and we are out of time so we are headed to 30 more minutes. Buckle up.   All right. Despair in the bar 'ecause Croatia has just scored. Now it is 2-1 and England is not winning.   Come on. Come on.  And that is it. They lost but they are still singing. A lovely little moment of applause there for the team that - they did not win but they fought hard.  Mary Louise Kelly with soccer fans in London watching England lose.
