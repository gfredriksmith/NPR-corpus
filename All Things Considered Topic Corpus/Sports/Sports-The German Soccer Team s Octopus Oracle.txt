 Well speaking of predictions Robert an octopus has become one of the more unlikely stars of this World Cup. His name is Paul. He is 2 12 years old and he lives at an aquarium in Oberhausen Germany.  My name is Oliver Walenciak and I am Paul's keeper.  Oliver Walenciak spends his days entertaining Paul.  It is a cute octopus. We are playing quite a lot so I would say we fall in love to him.  The aquarium staff decided to use Paul to choose the winners of Germany's matches which he did with uncanny accuracy. Here's what they did. The staff placed two glass jars in Paul's aquarium one with the German flag and one with the opposing team's flag. They placed food in both jars. And whichever jar Paul decided to eat from they took as the team he predicted to win the match.  Like yesterday Paul shocked Germany by eating out of the jar with the Spanish flag. Some fans are blaming the octopus for Germany's defeat today. They are saying he jinxed an already superstitious team but his perfect record of World Cup prognostication is intact. No word yet on whom he favors in Sunday's final.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
