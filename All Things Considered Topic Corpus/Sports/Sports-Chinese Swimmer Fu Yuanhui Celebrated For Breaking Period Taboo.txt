 One Olympian who has become a fan favorite is Chinese swimmer Fu Yuanhui.   .  When she learned she would won bronze in the 100-meter backstroke her face lit up. Wow too fast - I broke the Asian record she said.  People call her  which is like she is a walking emoji set.  A walking emoji set - that is Chinese journalist Han Zhang. So people were already paying attention to the swimmer when she said something unusual on Sunday. Her team finished fourth in the four-by-100 medley relay and grimacing in pain she explained to an interviewer why she was a bit off.   .  It is because I just got my period yesterday Fu said so I am still a bit weak and really tired. China's social network lit up. Talking about menstruation is still taboo in China. The country does not even have a domestic tampon maker though the first is scheduled to open soon. So Fu's remarks broke a barrier says journalist Han Zhang.  It is really amazing because it did not just touch on being a sports woman but also like feminism in games. And there are so many layers to it. But the first reaction is oh I cannot believe she said that. And of course she did that - just saying a lot of things that popular swimmers were not really saying before her.  So Fu may not have won gold on Sunday but as CNN put it she won the internet.
