 All right so the second week of Wimbledon ends this weekend.  Venus Williams and Roger Federer will play in the finals.  Of all the great on-the-court moments that have happened so far there was also an off-the-court moment we wanted to make sure you did not miss.  It happened when Britain's Andy Murray was taking questions after his loss to American Sam Querrey.   Andy Sam is the first U.S. player to reach a major semifinal since 2009. How would you describe the...  Male player.  I beg your pardon.  Male player right?  Yes the first male player. That is for sure .  Male player - what Murray was doing was correcting the reporter who said Sam Querrey was the first American player to reach a major semi since 2009 because Serena Williams won 14 majors in that time.  And Venus Williams has won some too. Plus there are other U.S. women who have gone to semis since 2009.  After hearing Murray's comments Serena Williams told ESPN she was not surprised. She said he has spoken up for women's issues and women's rights especially in tennis for forever. He does it again.  And his mom Judy Murray tweeted that is my boy. Then she typed a heart emoji.
