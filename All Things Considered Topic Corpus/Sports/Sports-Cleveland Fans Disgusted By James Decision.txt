 I am Dan Bobkoff in Cleveland on a rainy and thundery day after the LeBron James decision. I am standing in front of a large billboard behind the Quicken Loans Arena where he played for seven seasons. It shows LeBron arms stretched wide as if in victory.  We are all witnesses. But here in Cleveland people feel like they witnessed something else last night. Mr.  It does not make sense.  Garret Welsh drove 75 miles to be with Cavs fans at a downtown bar. As the TV spectacle began Welsh was disgusted with the weeks of hype that culminated in that unprecedented hour. It felt like a snubbing. Mr.  But to come on national television with millions upon millions upon millions of people watching to embarrass - it is not just a city man it is a state. Hey you are embarrassing a state.  Soon as Welsh feared LeBron made his announcement. And many disgusted fans took to the streets burning jerseys and destroying LeBron posters. LeBron grew up in Ohio and played his entire pro career in Cleveland. He was known as the team player a good guy. Did he really have to leave like this? This afternoon outside that big billboard Clevelander Jarred Perry said LeBron was unprofessional. Mr.  You at least owe your owner a courtesy of a phone call. You know be a man about it.  That owner Dan Gilbert released a seething letter last night calling LeBron narcissistic and his leaving a betrayal. But today team leaders were looking forward. At a news conference the Cavaliers' new coach Byron Scott was moving on. Mr.  To be honest with you I mean LeBron made his choice. You know he is in Miami. We are here in Cleveland and we still have the same you know passion about the game of basketball. We still have the same passion about winning.  And as the rain came down today one woman pulled up to that giant billboard of LeBron to take a picture - and started crying. It is a last look the sign comes down next week.
