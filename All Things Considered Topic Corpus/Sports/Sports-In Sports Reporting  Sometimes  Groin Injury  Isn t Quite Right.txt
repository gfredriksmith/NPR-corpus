 A sensitive subject - or maybe we should say area - came into question last night during the NBA finals game between the Golden State Warriors and the Cleveland Cavaliers. Golden State's Andre Iguodala was running down the court when Matthew Dellavedova of the Cavs reached around him to hit the ball away. But he hit something else.   Iguodala took exception to something right away.  Well he tells his team right away he was hit below the belt.  A similar thing happened during a game last month and Kyle Wagner of FiveThirtyEight analyzed the media's description of this part of a man's body. Groin was used the most but that is not actually accurate.  Because in sports you can like tear or pull your groin muscle which is you know a muscle in your leg.  Some news outlets were more precise.  There was nut shots jewels rocks cherry picking. And Ray Ratto at CSN called it I think the heritage factory which was pretty good.  Let us leave it right there. Kyle Wagner's full analysis is at FiveThirtyEight.com.    Hit me with your best shot. Fire away.
