 NPR's Mike Pesca has this look back at his life.  The singular trait that set him apart according to Paul O'Neill who won four World Series with the Yankees was Steinbrenner's competitiveness.  I have never played for anybody that felt like you know one of your teammates as far as competing to win. You know I had all the respect in the world for him because I knew that he went in to win as bad as I did and it was not a business to him. It was a challenge to win.  To get there Steinbrenner changed managers like some people changed socks and seemed to hold both in similar regard. He hired and fired Billy Martin five times. They made a beer commercial about it.   The best thing is it tastes so great.  No George the best thing is less filling.  No Bill it tastes great.  Less filling George.  Billy it tastes great.  Less filling George.  Martin lost that argument too. In the 1970s the Yankees won and brawled their way to two World Series titles and the nickname The Bronx Zoo. Steinbrenner was proudly meddlesome he told 60 Minutes in 1987.   Is not that funny I do not really care whether they like me. I would like them to respect me and sometimes that does not happen. What I try to do is instill a sense of discipline in my players a mental toughness and a discipline.  But upon his return in 1993 Steinbrenner had either mellowed or was smart enough to start trusting his underlings. Paul O'Neill remembers the boss offering support to a Yankee second baseman whose argument with an umpire led to a playoff loss.  So there were two sides of George that you know only the public saw the intense side.  Mike Pesca NPR News New York.
