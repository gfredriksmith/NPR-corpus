 Drama on the golf links today. Fifty-nine-year-old Tom Watson had the chance to become the oldest golfer ever to win a major tournament. He was on the 18th and final hole leading by a stroke just an eight-foot putt away from history and his sixth victory at the British Open.    Mr.  Evened it up there. It is all over. Four-hole playoff with Tom Watson and Stewart Cink. Watson bogeys the 72nd hole.  That is ABC's Mike Tirico. That bogey left Watson in a tie with a man 23 years his junior. Cink dominated the playoff that followed and won his first British Open. Still by leading for most of the Open's four days Tom Watson became a hero for graying golfers everywhere. And to a somber crowd at the post-tournament press conference  Mr.  This as not a funeral you know.
