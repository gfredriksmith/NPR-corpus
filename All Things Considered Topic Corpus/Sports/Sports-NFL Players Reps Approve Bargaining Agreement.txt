 As NPR's Mike Pesca reports that means the lockout is ending and the pro football season will go forward.  At a press conference announcing the new deal New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft wanted it known that football did not forget its fans.  First of all I would like on behalf of both sides to apologize to the fans that for the last five six months we have been talking about the business of football but the end result is we have been able to have an agreement that I think is going to allow this sport to flourish over the next decade.  At this afternoon's press conference the two opposing showed warmth towards each other. There was ever a genuinely touching moment when Indianapolis Colts center Jeff Saturday took time to thank all the wives including the late wife of the Patriots owner.  A special thanks to Myra Kraft who even in her weakest moment allowed Mr. Kraft to come and fight this out. And without him this deal does not get done.  Mike Pesca NPR News.
