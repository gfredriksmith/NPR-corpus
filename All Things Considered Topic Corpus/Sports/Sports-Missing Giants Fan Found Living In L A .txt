 A few weeks ago in the San Francisco Chronicle we read about Billy Chamberlain. He was a regular near the players' entrance at ATT Park home of the San Francisco Giants. For years before and after every game Billy would be there to greet the team. He became friendly with players and manager Bruce Bochy. We talked with Bochy earlier this month about Billy.  You know he usually you know would say something positive if we lost. Hey we will get them tomorrow and you know we are going to win. We are going to win the championship. You know he was always very positive and would come down and watch his boys play.  Now Billy lived on disability and would have been homeless if a park guard had not taken him in. But in July Billy disappeared. Police filed a missing person report and Bruce Bochy told us the team got involved.  They checked everywhere from hospitals - I hate to even say it - even morgues. To be honest I do not know where Billy grew up and you know I do not know if he went home or - we have no idea.  Well yesterday Billy popped up in Los Angeles outside Dodger Stadium. He told a Chronicle reporter that he was fine and that he had simply decided it was time to move south to LA.  homeless hungry. Can you help please? God bless you.
