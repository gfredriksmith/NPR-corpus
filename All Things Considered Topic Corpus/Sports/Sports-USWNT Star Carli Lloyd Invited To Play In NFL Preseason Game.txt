 U.S. soccer star Carli Lloyd is all over the news this week because of a kick.   Lloyd may get one here. Carli Lloyd - she is got it - 13-0 U.S.  No not a kick on a soccer field. It was actually a 55-yard field goal that the World Cup star let loose at a training session for the Philadelphia Eagles last week.   Yeah.   That is the Eagles of the National Football League - American football.  Now for some perspective that is a tough kick for most kickers in the NFL right now. So a video of it went viral. Lloyd's a huge Eagles fan and the whole thing started when the team invited her to watch them practice.  And at the end they unexpectedly - they call her onto the field and she takes a few steps there and - without no warmup nothing - and kicks the ball through the goal.  That is Lloyd's longtime coach James Galanis. He says after that video got shared around they started getting some phone calls.  Some of these calls were from NFL teams. One team even invited Lloyd to join the roster for a preseason game on Thursday. That would make her the first woman to play in an NFL preseason game.  It could change the way the world thinks seeing it at that level.  Unfortunately Lloyd had to decline. She is already scheduled to play in a soccer game the same day. But Galanis says it could happen in the future. She would need to train first but he says she is already got the right mindset.  Shutting the whole world out and just thinking that is the only thing that exists and going through striking that ball through the guts straight down the middle - I think that is also something that Carli will not have a problem with doing - that zone thing that I am talking about.  And if she does it Galanis says it could open the door for women not just to play in the NFL but in any male-dominated league.
