 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.     Damien Ressiot writes about sport drug use for French newspaper L'Equipe.   If I were Armstrong I would be worried because it is no longer sports authorities looking into this. These are federal agents doing the investigation. And there seems to be a real will in the U.S. to crack doping cases these days.  That does not mean anything says Ressiot.   Marion Jones was tested 160 times and came up negative every time. And as it turns out she doped her entire career. You can dope and never be caught. You just have to have the right products money and be very careful.  Armstrong has dismissed Landis' charges saying nothing the disgraced cyclist says can be believed. And the cloud of allegations hanging over him seems to have little effect on his popularity with fans at the Tour de France.   French fan Jocelyn Bouvier and his friends say they will always admire Armstrong for the way he overcame cancer.      Pierre Callewart a cycling correspondent with L'Equipe says in his 13 appearances Armstrong has changed the Tour de France.  When he started to study the road and preview the stages 10 or 12 years ago no one was doing that and now everyone is doing it. They like his way of riding his way of preparing his work ethics.
