 We have been saying Yogi-isms around the office all day.  It is deja vu all over again.  And at some point it hit us. Yogi really did have nuggets of wisdom for like every situation. About learning...  You can observe a lot by watching.  About time...  It gets late early out here.  Fan mail...  Never answer an anonymous letter.  Oh and sleeping...  I usually take a 2-hour nap from 1 to 4.  And of course traveling...  Why buy good luggage? You only use it when you travel.  Now some question if Yogi Berra actually said all of the Yogi-isms he is credited with. Even Yogi himself did...  I did not really say everything I said.  So if you think...  We made too many wrong mistakes.  Just remember...  If the world were perfect it would not be.  ...Some of the ALL THINGS CONSIDERED staff with their tribute to Yogi Berra. Thanks guys.
