 Here's an example of crowdsourcing - real crowdsourcing - that played out last night at Quicken loans Arena in Cleveland. It was the start of Game 3 of the NBA Finals between the Cavaliers and the Golden State Warriors.  Singer Jessica Ruiz asked the huge crowd to join her in the national anthem. She began to sing.    O say can you see...  And then lowered her microphone.   ...By the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming.  Tracy Marek is chief marketing officer with the Cavs.  Usually this time of year we are spending a lot of time thinking about which celebrity to bring in and who could really help just to create a very dynamic memorable national anthem. And it occurred to us that maybe instead of having one national anthem singer it might be more exciting to have 20562 people singing the song.    And the rockets' red glare the bombs bursting in air...  The tradition of having the crowd do the singing began in Cleveland during the playoffs. The Cavs won last night's finals game 120-to-90.  The Warriors still lead the series two-to-one. Thanks to cleveland.com for the recording of the Cavs fans singing.    O say does that star-spangled banner...
