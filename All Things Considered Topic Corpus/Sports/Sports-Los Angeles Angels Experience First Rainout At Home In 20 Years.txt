 It is not usually news when a baseball game is rained out. But yesterday in Southern California a heavy downpour forced the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim to postpone a game against the Boston Red Sox.  It was the first time in 20 years that the Angels had to send fans home wet and without a ballgame.  There was not a drop in the sky when we arrived.  Longtime fan David Tuason showed up two hours early and then it started to drizzle.  And then the rain started coming down harder and harder and harder.  This was a novelty for fans in Anaheim. Some went out to feel the rain on their faces and some got inventive. Fans huddled in covered areas leaving the stadium seats empty.  Then two-and-a-half hours after the game was supposed to start they heard this announcement there would be no ballgame.  The collective groan was let us try to play let us stay a little longer because it was still daylight out.  Still this cloud has a silver lining. California is in the grip of a terrible drought and David Tuason says he welcomed the rain and an Angels-Red Sox rematch.  For the first time before a game in Los Angeles I looked at the forecast this morning .  The outlook - partly cloudy with a 100 percent chance of a doubleheader.
