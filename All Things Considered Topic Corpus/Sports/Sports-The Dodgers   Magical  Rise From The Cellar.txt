 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. The Los Angeles Dodgers are the hottest team in baseball. They have won 40 of their last 48 games. And last night they came from behind in dramatic fashion to beat the New York Mets in 12 innings. As NPR's Nathan Rott reports it is a remarkable turnaround for a team that was near the cellar before the All-Star break.   They are calling Dodgers Stadium the Magic Castle. Attendance is up TV ratings are up star power is up. And the on-field play is well let us let legendary announcer Vince Scully describe it.  Amidst all the madhouse there is some magic and the Dodgers have now won eight straight 13 out of 14. They are 40 and 8. They have won 12 straight series. Everything they do is magical.  That was after Adrian Gonzalez scorched a winning hit down the third base line completing an improbable comeback in last night's game. Since the All-Star break the Dodgers are 23 and 3 and they have only lost one game in the month of August. For those that do not follow baseball that is hot really hot. To put it in perspective the last team that was this hot was the 1942 St. Louis Cardinals.  You know that kind of streak does not happen in baseball. There is so many days where you just - things going the wrong way.  Peter Gammons would know. He is a Hall of Fame baseball columnist who now covers the sport on his own website gammonsdaily.com.  The way this team has morphed from just being a team of stars that struggled early at times to being a team that really plays as a team to me is remarkable. I think it is the number one story in baseball.  Which is a much needed relief for America's game. Suspensions and steroid use have stolen most of the headlines in the last month. The surging Dodgers are a welcome change. Gammons says they are a positive for baseball and have helped bring credibility back to the game.  It is really important for baseball that the Dodgers are good.  After all he says they are one of the two most important franchises in the sport. And for years good was not a word you would use to describe them. Ask Gus Castanis.   I went through the Frank McCourt Dodger years and they were so miserable.  Frank McCourt is a curse word in Dodgers Stadium. He is the team's former owner and is pretty much universally despised for putting profits over play. It got so bad Major League Baseball forced him to sell the team a year ago. He did keep the parking lots. The new owners a group that includes Lakers icon Magic Johnson shelled out hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the team and the fans back. Our fan Castanis was there through it all.  So I figure this must be payback penance you know?  And maybe that is where the magic is coming from here in the Magic Castle. Down 2-4 at the bottom of the ninth the fans still have hope.  It is exciting no matter what because you feel like you have a chance.  Which is why he stands when Andre Ethier takes the plate down two.   Let us go. Let us go. Let us go. Let us go. Let us go.  Ethier hits a two-run homer tying the game at four. So you were saying about that chance?   There is always a chance. And I do not know. Maybe there is something about how many people are left here 20000 people? All believing that we have a chance that maybe makes Andre Ethier think that he is got a shot of hitting it out to left field. That was exciting.  Exciting magic that is the new era of Dodgers baseball. Nathan Rott NPR News.
