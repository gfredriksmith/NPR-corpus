 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. After more than five months in prison some Russian dissidents are getting their day in court. Three young women are alleged to be members of a feminist punk band that staged a protest against Vladimir Putin last February. As NPR's Corey Flintoff reports from Moscow their case is widely viewed as a test of the way Putin's government will handle dissent.   The band calls itself Pussy Riot. Here's what they did that caused all the fuss.   In February five members of the band rushed before the altar of the Cathedral of Christ the Savior one of Moscow's main Russian Orthodox cathedrals.  minidresses tights and brightly colored balaclava masks. Before they were thrown out by security people band members brandished guitars danced genuflected and prayed. Shortly afterward a video of their exploit was posted on YouTube. The song takes the form of a punk prayer asking the Virgin Mary to deliver Russia from Putin. It also criticizes the leader of the church Patriarch Kirill for supporting Putin's presidential campaign saying the patriarch believes in Putin when he should believe in God. The band had already gained attention for its street-theater tactics.    In February one of the band members who identified herself only by the nom-de-guerre Schumacher told NPR that she believed the Russian opposition was ready for more radical action. The Russian government was apparently ready too. Shortly after the cathedral performance three alleged band members were arrested and charged with hooliganism motivated by hatred of the church. It is a crime that carries a sentence of up to seven years in prison. The three women - 23-year-old Nadezhda Tolokonnikova 24-year-old Maria Alekhina and Yekaterina Samutsevich who is 29 - have been in jail ever since. There have been pleas for mercy for the women two of whom are the mothers of small children. The pleas have come not just from members of the opposition but from some Orthodox believers who say the church should show mercy even though they say they found the performance to be deeply offensive. But Patriarch Kirill called the performance blasphemy and demanded tough punishment for the band members. This morning a lawyer for the women Violetta Volkova told reporters outside the courthouse that the trial was political aimed not at protecting the church but at punishing opposition to the government.    Volkova says that what is taking place in the courtroom now is lawlessness and legal nihilism on the part of the government. Later on in court Volkova read out statements from the defendants who pleaded not guilty but said they were sorry if their actions offended believers. Maria Lipman an editor and analyst from the Carnegie Center in Moscow stands on the sidelines outside the court. She says she thinks the prosecution will seek to get the trial over fairly quickly before it draws too much more attention and criticism.  The authorities want to have this trial passed on as soon as possible so that this irritant this event that attracts so much attention is out of Moscow and crowds like this one today will not gather.  The trial resumes tomorrow. Corey Flintoff NPR News Moscow.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
