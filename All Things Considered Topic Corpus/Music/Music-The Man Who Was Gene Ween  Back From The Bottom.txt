 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. For many years musician Aaron Freeman went by the name Gene Ween. Along with a childhood buddy who took on the moniker Dean Ween they formed an alternative rock band and with a very twisted sense of humor. The band Ween had a loyal following and put out several successful albums but along with fame came the rock 'n roll life. Freeman wound up with a serious drug problem. Two years ago the band broke up and the guitarist and singer went to rehab. Now Aaron Freeman is back with a solo album that explores what went wrong. For member station KPCC PAlex Cohen has this story.  Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo grew up in New Hope Pennsylvania. They quickly became friends bonding over their love of music one day in the eighth grade.  I remember going to his house and he was writing these punk rock riffs. And I just started screaming into the mic you know onto a cheap tape recorder cassette and that was it.  Something clicked that day says Freeman and soon enough the two were developing the Ween sound - a sound which relied heavily on fiddling around with tape speed and plenty of references to drugs and alcohol.   We totally support and encourage young children to smoke crack and drink a lot.  In the late 1980's Ween released six cassette tapes.    My wife's fat my brother's thin. I do not care I drink a lot. All you people live or not. I do not care I drink a lot.  A lot of this stuff is really noisy and sort of difficult to take.  That Hank Shteamer music editor at Time Out New York and an author of a book about Ween.  But then over time it evolved into something a lot more serious and substantial.    Why you want to see my spine mommy?  Shteamer's book focuses on what happened to the band after they landed a deal with Elektra Records and produced a much more polished album in 1994 which included some pretty bizarre songs.    Smile on mighty Jesus spinal meningitis got me down.  Right alongside beautiful tracks which seemed to come straight from the heart.    It is been a while since I have seen you smile but you have come back again. Came into the room and you saw my girl and you asked her how long it is been.  There is other bands that are funny there is other bands that are sad. But I do not know that I can think of another band who is that extreme about their emotions in a way.  That extremity Hank Shteamer says struck a chord. Eventually the band wound up with a large and intensely loyal following. Like fans of the Grateful Dead the Ween tribe liked to trade recordings of live shows and they like to party a lot. But the drugs and booze became a serious problem for the man on stage Aaron Freeman.  I just was not a happy camper and I was you know very addicted and very out of control.  He says he had been on a bender for several days in 2001 when Ween played a show in Vancouver.   I wrote this song after two weeks on mushrooms.  Freeman could barely play. He forgot lyrics. At one point he just laid down on the stage and started ranting. Finally his fellow band members walked off stage and left them alone to finish the show.   .  Eventually Freeman made the choice to go into rehab and to break up the band.  And it helped me. It helped me get my head together. It helped me focus. It helped me get sober and eventually write music again.  One of the songs he wrote for his solo debut is about that infamous Vancouver show.    Down in the lobby there is a couple left. Have them buy me a round. I am your best friend. I am your superstar. Yeah I am down with the brown. We in the bathroom. Let us be super cool. You have got a little bit left. What a special thing. I am your trophy boys. Get the  out my face. Could see you will go home satisfied. I will be blacked out for the night.  Aaron Freeman says it was cathartic to write about what went down from his perspective.  You know when you are blacking out and you are getting on the bus the next day you are terrified. It is horrible and you feel really ashamed of yourself. And as mad as other people are at you boy you feel worse - the alcoholic and the addict - and you do not even know you feel that.    In the morning I cannot remember. I cannot remember a thing. I am on the bus now. They will not look at me. Man it is always the same. I am broken. Why cannot you see? Can you give me your hand? No I am the bad guy - do not appreciate cannot you see who I am?  As part of his process of recovery Freeman moved to Woodstock New York and took a job teaching music.  I have seen an enormous change in him.  Paul Green is the founder of the Paul Green Rock Academy where Aaron Freeman has been teaching kids and teenagers about what it is like to be a working musician.  When you are in a rock band like Ween and you are touring there is an amount of cynicism of some level involved. But when he is teaching these kids it is pure it is idealistic in the best way and it is making music for music's sale. And I have really seen Aaron's love of just the music making process really jump up out and I really see it in his eyes.  Teaching at the rock Academy has really helped a lot says Aaron Freeman. But he realizes he still has a long way to go earning back the trust of others especially his family.  When you are a musician first of all you are kind of like Peter Pan. When you are in a rock band you do not have to do anything. You do not have to be accountable you just have to get on stage. So I really had no like skills on how to be a man - a 42-year-old man. And that is something I wanted to be. I wanted to be that guy that if my daughter called at two in the morning and needed me to pick her up I was going to be there.    For a while I could not play my guitar like a man.  Freeman realizes there may be sometime before his family and his fans trust that he is really sober. But he says he is striving to live his birth name and the name on the cover of his new album. He hopes to truly be a free man. For NPR News I am Alex Cohen.
