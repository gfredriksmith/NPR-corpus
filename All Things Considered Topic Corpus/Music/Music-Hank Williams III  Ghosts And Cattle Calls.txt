 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Hank Williams III is keeping up family tradition but he is also breaking new ground. Hank III is the grandson of the country music legend and he is the son of Southern rocker and country boy Hank Jr. Hank III got his musical start playing punk and metal. But he also plays country and he is just released four CDs that bend and blend those musical genres. Meredith Ochs has this review.  If your name is Hank Williams and you could have pretty much anyone you want play on your records who would you hire? Why  your own dog.    I am running my dog in a Tennessee holler listening to what he is saying. I am running my dog in a Tennessee holler listening to what he is saying.   Yes that is Trooper the dog of Hank III. But what else would you expect from Williams? Born of country music's most iconic bloodline he has always cast off expectations challenging the music industry the press and even his fans. In concert Williams would often go from a set of straight-up country to punk rock and metal with only the most broadminded audience members sticking it out for the whole show. And those are the ones who will truly appreciate this four-disc opus. Ghost to a Ghost is for the most part unambiguously country. But its companion piece Gutter Town plays like the soundtrack to a horror film a demented Cajun campfire on the outskirts of a creepy deserted village.   Hank Williams III has used ambient sounds and blips and bleeps on recordings in the past. But it is the third CD Cattle Callin' on which he - well innovates. In his never-ending genre-bending quest Williams creates what he calls cattlecore setting the rapid-fire calls of cattle auctioneers to superspeed metal.    As if all that is not enough there is a fourth disc called Hank 3's Attention Deficit Disorder - Williams' foray into doom rock.   With his instrumental skill his vocal ability and his pedigree Hank Williams III could have easily coasted into a mainstream country music career. Legend has it that Minnie Pearl who was very close to the Williams family  Lord honey you are a ghost - because he so closely resembles his grandfather. You can hear the possibilities on songs like this one.    I have been running all around just burning up the land knowing I would have a damn good time. Leaving like the wind always ready to begin burning out to get you overdrive. Tearing up the mountains burning up some fields riding rivers on a good day. Running full throttle and racing like hell we are going to make it through one more day. Yeah we are living day by day...  But as much as country music runs through Hank III's veins so does rebellion. After all his grandpa was thrown out of the Grand Ole Opry. Most of the music on Williams' four CDs bears little resemblance to Hank Sr. but his reckless spirit is in there.  ALL THINGS CONSIDERED will continue in a moment.
