 When New Orleans musician Allen Toussaint died last year he was almost finished with a multi-year project. He was recording intimate renditions of songs he loved. Reviewer Tom Moon says the result titled American Tunes is an elegant new perspective on Toussaint's legacy.  Allen Toussaint produced wickedly funky records by LaBelle The Meters and others. But when he sat at the piano he gravitated towards a completely different sound - music informed by a sly sophistication.   That is his take on a song by his first idol Professor Longhair. Toussaint does not mess with the flamboyant scampering runs that define New Orleans piano. Instead he changes the harmony and finds some new melancholy within the melody.   Another highlight - Toussaint's idyllic Southern Nights reimagined as a two piano fantasy with Van Dyke Parks.   There is history here. In the early '70s when Van Dyke Parks was a staff producer for Reprise Records he was dispatched to New Orleans to prod Toussaint to finish his second solo album. The artist only needed one more song but he was in the grip of writer's block. Parks advised him to imagine what he would write if he was told he had two weeks to live. That did the trick. Within a few days out came this song.   The new album closes with the only Allen Toussaint vocal Paul Simon's American Tune.    I dreamed I was flying high up above my eyes could clearly see the Statue of Liberty sailing away to the sea. I dreamed I was flying.  It is a straight read nothing fancy. He sings it the same way he plays piano - gracefully using understatement to devastating effect. That kind of poise is easy to overlook. But it is crucial to just about everything on this delightful survey of American Tunes and it is one of the qualities that made Allen Toussaint an American treasure.    It is all right. It is all right. It is all right. You cannot be forever blessed.  Tom Moon reviewed the posthumous release from Allen Toussaint American Tunes.
