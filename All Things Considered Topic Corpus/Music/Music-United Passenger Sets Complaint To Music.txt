 Like Bruce Jacob Dave Carroll also had a problem with a guitar last year a very different problem. And since Dave Carroll is a songwriter and not an electrical engineer his invention was a song and a video on YouTube.  Mr.   I flew United Airlines on my way to Nebraska the plane departed Halifax connecting in Chicago's O'Hare. While on the ground a passenger said from the seat behind me my God they are throwing guitars out there.  That is right. The United baggage handlers were manhandling his 3500 instrument. It was a smashing performance literally. By the time Dave Carroll was reunited with his guitar it had a broken neck. He complained to the airline but got no joy. Mr.   So began a year-long saga of pass the buck do not ask me and I am sorry sir your claim can go nowhere.  That is when Carroll put his customer complaint to music. His song United Breaks Guitars went viral on YouTube. And now a United spokesperson says the airline has contacted him about the guitar and should have done so a lot sooner. United also says it would like to use his video for training purposes to ensure that all United customers receive better service and that the video struck a chord with the airline. Mr.   Yeah United breaks guitars.  This is NPR National Public Radio.
