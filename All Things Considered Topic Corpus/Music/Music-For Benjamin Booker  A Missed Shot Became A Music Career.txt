 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I am Tess Vigeland. And this is the story of a 25-year-old musician who burst onto the scene thanks to a homemade demo that quickly became the talk of the music world. This is Benjamin Booker.    Where I am going where I am going? Where I am going I will never know. Into the fire I thought you will put it girl.  This song is Violent Shiver from Booker's self-titled debut album which sounds a little better than those bedroom demos. He made those just a few years ago at his boyhood home in Tampa expecting nothing would come of them.  And then I shared them with some friends and they got picked up by a blog out in LA - Aquarium Drunkard. And then they played them on Sirius Satellite Radio. And then yeah after that I just got calls and e-mails from people. That is when things started picking up.  And by picking up he means signing with a big label getting booked to play at the Newport Folk Festival and Lollapalooza and David Letterman and Conan O'Brien. Arun Rath spoke with Benjamin Booker earlier this week.   Now I also heard that NPR played a role in your musical development.  Yeah I mean I listen to a lot of NPR. I tried to intern there after college. I did not get it.  Well that was what I heard. I heard you applied for an internship and it did not come through.  Yeah the guy I play bass with Alex actually did intern at NPR. He probably took the internship that I did not get.   If you got that internship do you think you would have struck out in music the way you have?  No not at all. I would have probably just done that and probably be doing that right now yeah .  So NPR did you a favor in a way - or the musical world favor because I am sure you would have been a great intern.  Yeah. I mean I was obsessed with NPR when I was in college yeah.  How would you describe the sound? Well I saw you describe it somewhere as punk blues?  Yeah I mean I get you describe it as punk blues. I guess when I was putting it together I was thinking of just using like gospel and like blues melodies - the stuff that I was listening to at the time and putting that with the punk I had grown up with and just like the rhythm and blues kind of like '50s rhythm and blues that I was listening to. So just mixing those things together yeah.    Always working always working. He said God is working. And he said God is working. Always searching always searching. He said Devil's working. He said Devil's working. Baby do not wait. These songs are the first songs I have ever written. So it is been about two years I think. And I played my first live show in maybe May or June of 2012. So it has not been too long.  Wow. And everybody wants to be a star but do you feel like you were ready for that? Because again it happened so quickly before you know it you were playing at Lollapalooza and the Newport Folk Festival.  Yeah I mean I guess I have learned a lot about myself. I think I happen to be one of those people who like does pretty well under pressure. And of course I like stress out about all of these things before they happen and like I do not know almost unable to like move like sometimes before these things. But they always end up working out.    Told me that the world is full of sinners and placed that Bible at my feet.  I noticed that you have some - a few religious themes on this album. Most clearly in the song Have You Seen My Son?  Yeah I mean I grew up in a very very religious family. And I do not know I was struggling I guess around the time that I was writing the songs because - I do not know - I guess my family had certain expectations of where I should go with my life and the kind of person that I should be. And I just had a different idea.  What were their expectations for you?  My dad was in the military. And my mom went to school for like theology and stuff and like they - I mean they just want me to like get married and have kids and join the military and that kind of thing. And I was like I want to play rock 'n roll music.   And yeah - I do not know - there is like always going to be like a little part of them that is like disappointed. But it is OK. I do not know things have gotten - our relationship is  definitely stronger now.  Well I have to think they are a bit more convinced about this being a pretty good career path.  I mean they would still like me to do something else .    All the way from Florida all the way down to New Orleans. I said God must love everyone even the ones he just loves the least. They say that when a mother loves a child she will do most anything. I know that I can never make it right but it is hard to hear you say have you seen my son? He is lost in the world somewhere. I help him.  I am speaking with Benjamin Booker about his self-titled debut album. It comes out on Tuesday. How old are you? You are 25?  Yeah 25.  Because these songs sound like they come from an old place.  I mean there is a lot happening. I guess I get a lot of experience in a very short period of time. I mean Florida's really a rough rough place to live sometimes. So...  Well talk about that. How - rough way in what ways?  At the time I guess I was a pretty self-destructive person. And I was in a relationship with somebody who was the same way. And it was just like a bad combination. I was also living with somebody who was like addicted to drugs and there was like people shooting up in my living room and stuff. And...  You know it is kind of a cliche question but is the music therapeutic for you in that way?  It was mostly - I mean I was writing the songs before I knew that they were going to be released. And it was mostly a way to like start conversations with friends. Like the girl that I mentioned earlier - my friend who is like addicted to drugs - I remember writing one of the songs I thought of her just screaming this thing that happened and just like sharing that song with her and like that started I guess like a dialogue between us. It was just like a way for us to start  talking about something that was hard for me to talk about or get started you know.    Set yourself on fire so high so high. I could feel your heart was beating. did you love me or was it drugs? It was just hard to come out at the beginning and say those things. But I think writing the songs and sharing them made them easier.    And our love we are living now will surely bury me.  At Lollapalooza this year you joined the pantheon of rock greats who have smashed their guitars at the end of the show. Are you like a young Pete Townshend? Are you an angry young man?  No I am not an angry guy.  You do not sound angry.  No that was just like - we were - I was having like a rough show with the guitar. I was tuning the guitars that - that day. And I guess...  So that guitar was asking for it huh?   Yeah. It was kind of - I was really bummed out about it at the end. That was the first guitar I ever had so yeah.  So that was kind of a singular thing Benjamin Booker smashing the guitar.  Yeah no I do not regularly do that. If you come to the live shows do not expect me to smash guitars. I cannot afford to do that.   That is Benjamin Booker. His self-titled debut album comes out on Tuesday. But until then you can sample every track at our exclusive First Listen. That is at  nprmusic.org. And hey that means you are finally at NPR Music.  Yay.  Congratulations.  Thank you so much.    I have been thinking about love. Right now I am still thinking about her. Does a mother know her daughter's gone? Is she down on her knees now crying.  And for Saturday that is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I am Tess Vigeland.    I have been thinking about love. Right now I am still thinking about her. I can see her lonely face.
