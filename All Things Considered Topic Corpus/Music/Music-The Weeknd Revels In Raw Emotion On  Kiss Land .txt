 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. The Weeknd that is W-E-E-K-N-D is the artistic moniker of Toronto-based producer and singer-songwriter Abel Tesfaye. He became an Internet phenomenon in 2010 when he started self-releasing mixtapes of woozy haunted RB songs for free. He repackaged this material on a collection called Trilogy. And his proper major label debut was released just today. It is called Kiss Land and Will Hermes has this review.   Even if they are brokenhearted RB-style singers tend to make love seem like an achievable ideal. What is most remarkable about The Weeknd's music besides its deeply narcotic electronic arrangements is how remote and twisted love generally seems amidst the familiar trappings of pop music bliss.   RB singers also tend to come on as cool customers but Tesfaye is a hot mess his voice generally pushed up to a verge-of-hysteria falsetto that makes you think of Michael Jackson. And like many second albums Kiss Land addresses the pitfalls of success. How autobiographical is it? That is unclear. But you worry about the singer when you hear the title track a debased slow jam that ends with a breathless decent into drugged-out nightclub purgatory.   The Weeknd's gothic style interrogates a lot of the cliches of boilerplate RB. But on the more conventional tracks when he tries to have it both ways his approach can verge on shtick.   I just love that you are dead inside does not strike me as the year's most effective pop earworm. Of course some vampire film soundtrack supervisor may yet prove me wrong. Regardless the hat trick of Tesfaye's art is that by singing about emotional numbness he makes music that is the opposite of numbing. It feels raw probing and totally alive.   The new album by The Weeknd it is called Kiss Land. Our critic Will Hermes is author of the book Love Goes to Buildings on Fire.   This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
