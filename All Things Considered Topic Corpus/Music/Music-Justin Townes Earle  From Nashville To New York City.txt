Going uptown to the Harlem River to drown.  Earle sings about the 6 train not as an annoyed commuter like most of us who ride it  a lifer stuck in the subway tunnels away from sunlight family and home. Like the great old songs that influenced him Earle beautifully captures the feelings of monotony and discomfort of being a motorman on a train.   I run that 6 line train. I run the 6 line train.

That musical tour of New York City is from a new album from Justin Townes Earle called Harlem River Blues. Our reviewer Meredith Ochs is a talk show host and DJ with Sirius XM satellite radio.
