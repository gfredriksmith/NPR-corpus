 Many jazz pianists played tunes from The Great American Songbook the standards that were written in the first half of the 20th century. A pianist Edward Simon has chosen to focus on another great collection of American standards the Latin American songbook. That is also the title of his new piano trio recording. And Michelle Mercer has our review.   Growing up in Venezuela was an advantage for pianist Edward Simon. Living on the top edge of South America Simon's early listening encompassed music from the north Cuba and Puerto Rico and also extended southward to the music of Chile Brazil and Argentina.   When Simon set out to record his album Latin American Songbook he realized the music scope was too vast to represent every country. Instead he settled on Latin American songs that he simply loves to play.   Besides growing up in the geographic center of Latin America Simon came up in a musical household. This song Volver is a famous tango that his father sang as a bolero. So it is something of a family tradition for Simon to bring his own character to the song with some mixed meters. The unusual time gives Volver the mood of memory. The unreliability only adds to its loveliness.   Simon wisely chooses standards here that lend themselves to fresh harmonies and inventive arrangements. Even more essentially without a singer on hand he knows when to bring an extravagant lyricism to his piano lines like on this song Alfonsina Y El Mar.   The combination of Latin standards and a jazz sensibility is always rich. But this recording really works because an expert musician applies himself so sincerely to some formative songs here. Edward Simon puts his head and heart into Latin American Songbook. And the recording gives Latin standards a rightful and joyful place at the center of instrumental jazz.
