 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. The rock trio ZZ Top has been playing together for 42 years. They are known informally as that little ol' band from Texas. But they are also Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees who have sold over 50 million records. La Futura is their 15th studio album and their first release in nine years. We have a review from Meredith Ochs.   Over the years  dabbling in new wave flirting with grunge and techno making goofy music videos and even using a drum machine. But they never strayed too far from their classic amalgam of electric blues garage rock and greasy groove. And on their new CD they sound like their old selves.   Part of ZZ Top's return to form on the new album is the handiwork of Rick Rubin the eccentric producer and music visionary. Rubin's stripped-down approach in the studio worked well with the band highlighting the economy that makes the great rock trio so appealing. Rubin has also enjoyed success at bringing artists together with unlikely material which he does here with this late-'90s hip-hop tune that ZZ Top transform into a searing anthem all their own.   ZZ Top's Billy Gibbons is a guitar hero a master of tone and technique with impeccable taste in musical equipment and all that remarkable string-bending dances on the groove with one of rock' bassist Dusty Hill and drummer Frank Beard. So how do musicians who have been perfecting their craft for decades shepherd electric blues well into the 21st century? Ironically they look back. ZZ Top's new album is loaded with winks to their old catalog like this one which name-drops their 1979 song I am Bad I am Nationwide. These fleeting moments will jog the memories of fans about how great this band has always been. And it is a testament to the timelessness of this music.   That is the new album from ZZ Top La Futura.
