 The Avalanches use small pieces of old sound recordings to make their music like assembling mosaics. Their debut album Since I Left You is said to have used thousands of such audio samples.   It is the opinion of the entire staff that Dexter is criminally insane.  That was 16 years ago and now the band has finally released a follow up. It is called Wildflower. Our reviewer Will Hermes says it recalls a golden era for the art of sampling.   The Avalanches make music that is partly about the thrill of discovering weird old records. On their latest there is a 1940s calypso.    Ah Frankie Sinatra. Ah Frank Sinatra. Frankie my boy do not you know you have the perfect voice to sing calypso? What did they say? Ah Frankie Sinatra. Ah Frank Sinatra. Frankie my boy you do not know you have the perfect voice to sing calypso. What did they say? Frankie my boy you do not know you have the perfect voice to sing calypso. Off his rocker he is off his rocker.  There is also a children's choir singing a Beatles song.    Here come old flat-top. He come grooving up slowly. He got ju-ju eyeballs. He is one holy roller.  The Avalanches transform these samples into something more than the sum of the parts. And Wildflower shows the group's magic in full effect - that warm kaleidoscopic nostalgia conjured through sounds that are familiar but just barely.    Sunshine up above.  The groups' vibe taps into the '60s and the '70s but Wildflower is also a throwback to the '90s and early oughts when sampling was enough of a legal gray area that acts like Fatboy Slim and DJ Shadow were able to make brilliant album centered almost completely around samples. It is way harder and more expensive to make music that way now especially at this level of detail. But The Avalanches have made another great record. And hopefully the next one will not take them 16 years.    Being in love with you.  OK that is how I want to end a week. Will Hermes reviewed Wildflower by The Avalanches.
