 And now music for your journeys - the kind you take in a car.    I am the passenger and I ride and I ride.  It is time to check in on the ALL THINGS CONSIDERED road trip playlist.  That is right Rachel. These are the songs that our listeners say are essential - in some cases thematically appropriate - for long drives like this one The Passenger.    Singing la la la la la-la-la la. La la la la la-la-la la...  The Passenger got your shout-outs this cover by Siouxsie and the Banshees and the Iggy Pop original.  Now why put the cover version on the road trip playlist and not the original you ask? Who decided that?  It is the producer who put together the list frankly. Turns out the tape deck in her first car died playing this song so for sentimental reasons it is on the list.  And we have had to make all kinds of other tough choices because you sent us more than 3000 suggestions among them many different covers of the same song.    Well if you ever plan to motor west...    Jack take my way it is the highway that is the best.    Get your kicks on Route 66.  That is right multiple covers of Route 66 by Asleep at the Wheel Chuck Berry and Depeche Mode.  John Mayer the Rolling Stones Brian Setzer...  ...We listened to them all.  And ultimately decided to get our kicks with the original 1946 hit by the King Cole Trio.    Now you go through St. Louis Joplin Mo. and Oklahoma City looks mighty pretty you see. Amarillo...  A classic choice.  And we are building our playlist to a road trip-friendly mix of 99 songs.  One for every bottle of beer on the wall that you will not have to sing about.  The ALL THINGS CONSIDERED road trip playlist is at npr.org. Stream it and enjoy.    When you make that California trip get your kicks on Route 66.
