  That is the sound of Bombino a singer and guitarist from Niger. Bombino is one of the most popular and in-demand African musicians around today. Music critic Banning Eyre says his sixth album Deran will likely add to his global acclaim.  Bombino's stature is the product of hard work a few good breaks and outsized talent as a guitarist singer and songwriter. He is a Tuareg a nomadic people from the Sahara Desert who move between five countries. But the music plays basically Tuareg rock 'n' roll has been finding a home in rock and blues festivals all around the world.   .  Bombino is a deeply engaged ambassador for his people. The Tuareg has suffered through droughts displacements discrimination and warfare going back at least six decades. That is when the modern nations of North and West Africa were formed leaving little place for the hardy fiercely independent Tuareg. Bombino now in his mid-30s has lived this struggle twice forced into exile due to conflicts in Niger.   .  A lumbering lope of traditional folk and the raw bravado of rock 'n' roll merge easily in Bombino's hands. And he sings with personal charisma that sets him apart from other popular desert rock bands where the emphasis is often on a collective sound.   Deran comes on the heels of Bombino albums produced by rock stars from The Black Keys and Dirty Projectors. This is a back-to-roots effort mostly recorded in Casablanca but there is no mistaking all Bombino has learned about the fine points of electric guitar aesthetics muscular grooves and intriguingly varied song arrangements.   .  Bombino's take-no-prisoners guitar style can rival that of any blues rock shredder but there is so much more in this music - sweetness and warmth sadness joy also wisdom and defiance. On the album's final track Bombino prays for the revolution to succeed. But we know from what is gone before that he is looking for a revolution that brings peace to his troubled home and also to the world.   .
