 Today NPR published an explosive new video.    Shoes on get up in the morn cup of milk let us rock and roll. King Kong kick the drum rolling on like a Rolling Stone.  The song is Dynamite by the all-conquering Korean boy band BTS. It is their first song fully in English and it quickly burst to the top of the Billboard Hot 100.  Well they sang a special version for NPR Music as part of our Tiny Desk Concert series - though not actually at NPR headquarters what with this whole pandemic and all. Dressed in bright blazers and denim jeans and backed by a live band the group's singers sat side by side in a record store in Seoul.    Light it up like dynamite whoa.  Once we started doing Tiny Desk Concerts at home where we had artists recording themselves it was an opportunity to reach out to BTS and see if they could do something on their end.  NPR's Stephen Thompson helped make this happen. He noted that the video shattered the series record for YouTube views on its first day in about 25 minutes.  Twenty-five minutes - well all credit due to the BTS Army. That is what the band's global fan base calls itself and they are a powerful army.  You sort of get set upon by just like thousands and thousands of BTS fans who are like thank you so much for including them. This is a big deal for them. And it is like it is a big deal for them? They are the biggest band in the world.   This has been the roughest summer ever.  For BTS known for intricate choreography and eye-popping visuals the Tiny Desk home concert was pared back. The focus was on their voices and they closed with a deep cut the ballad Spring Day.   .  A landmark early autumn day for the Tiny Desk and also a reminder that BTS has arrived. The mainstream American market had been a tough nut for the band to crack. Looks like all it took was a little dynamite.    'ecause I am in the stars tonight. OK. So watch me bring the fire...
