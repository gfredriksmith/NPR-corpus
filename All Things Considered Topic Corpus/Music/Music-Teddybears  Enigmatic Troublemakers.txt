 And critic Robert Christgau says on their new album Devil's Music Teddybears go rock 'n' roll.  Teddybears rarely play live and prefer to hire more personable performers to front their tracks. They are capable of mild electronically treated vocals on mild electronically treated dance songs. But in general in Devil's Music they like things much livelier.    Mama have not you heard? You heard? We sold out all over the world. The world. I got yen in a suitcase from the Yakuza. I ama get my mama a house. I got rubles in a shoe box from the Russian mob. I ama get my mama a house.  And the title track of Devil's Music takes that old blues trope literally. Listen carefully and you will hear Robert Johnson name-checked as Robert J. down at the crossroads where Bo Diddley meets Eddie Van Halen.   Devil's music. Devil's music. .  Having established their rock 'n' roll bona fides Teddybears then expand the definition of rock 'n' roll. Troublemakers they may be  Crystal Meth Christians with Wayne Coyne of the neo-psychedelic Flaming Lips and Cardiac Arrest with their best known collaborator the Swedish dance thrush Robyn.    Hey little sister suffragette baby Barbie on barbiturates. Sleepy heads gonna wake up dead. A trail of crumbs leading from your bed. So come on and shake your bone maker and shake your bone maker.  The way Devil's Music gleefully morphs from style to style is challenging and endearing. Teddybears may be unnatural as musical sentimentalists define that silly term but their electropop has a heartbeat and their drum machines have soul.    Sell your soul to a 45. Lose yourself to the other side. Bow down to the big reverberation.  The new album from Teddybears is called Devil's Music. Our critic is Robert Christgau.   Lose yourself to the other side. Bow down to the big reverberation.
