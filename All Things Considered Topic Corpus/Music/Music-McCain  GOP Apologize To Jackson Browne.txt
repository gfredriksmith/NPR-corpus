 Little did we know but this music was an unfinished piece of business from last year's presidential campaign.   Jackson Browne has announced that he has settled a lawsuit against Senator McCain and the Republican Party and won an apology - maybe more. His song Running On Empty was featured in an ad that was put out by the Ohio Republican Party about energy policy.  Mr.   Running on running on empty running on running blind running on.  Jackson Browne was not a McCain supporter and he did not want anyone to think that he might be one either. So he went to court. Apparently Sam of Sam and Dave only had to ask nicely and the Obama campaign dropped his Hold On I am Comin' from it is campaign rallies.  Mr.   Well do not you ever be sad.
