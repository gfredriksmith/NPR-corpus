 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR West. I am Kelly McEvers.    We like the breeze flow straight out of our lids. Them they got moved by these hard-rock Brooklyn kids. Us floor rush...  As hip-hop morphed and evolved in the '80s and into the '90s a group called Digable Planets was one of a handful of bands to mix jazz and rap.   We be to rap what key be to lock. But I am cool like that I am cool like that.  That voice belongs to Ishmael Butler who again is pushing hip-hop into new territory - this time with a collective known as Shabazz Palaces. The new music has elements of Philip Glass minimalism Brian Eno ambience and a little bit of George Clinton cosmic weirdness.   We do not pose or talk or move - stellar beings lock step and groove. Hookah plot absurd our views. We do not wait on a word from you.  When I talked to Ishmael Butler I had a lot of questions for him. But first we had to straighten out just how to pronounce the name of his new album. The album is called Lese Majesty. Is that how you pronounce it?  You could say that that way. You could say Lese Majesty Lese Majesty. Yeah there is all kind of ways.  Oh you speak French.  I do not. I just act like I do.  .  Lese Majesty.  Yeah that went on for a while. Anyway the title of the new album however you say it is a French term for offending the dignity of a royal. I asked Ish why that intrigued him so much.  I like that. I like the concept of offending the dignity of a royal. But in this instance it is like a sonic attack on the meme mania that is kind of sweeping over this - our culture of late.  The meme mania - you mean like the world of the selfies. And you know I am eating a sandwich so I am going to post that online. That is what you mean by me mania?  Exactly. It is a bit detrimentally superficial. It is made for a less richer human experience. It is seeped into the music business into the marketing of music. And people really being more concerned about themselves especially in the rap game - about kind of bragging about material things rather than doing what one of the things I think music is really here to do is to unite people. We basically wanted to attack that philosophy.   Vanity I love you for myself. Me and always you and I was never no one else. Sanity a visage of my wealth lost but always found before the idols that I knelt. Strategy the only way to drive - keep it do-or-die and always think in terms of I. Reverie some legends you just pass. Revelry instead for real is hella fast.  You are from Seattle.  Yes.  And the alternative newspaper there The Stranger called this album the future of hip-hop. How aware of that are you? When you go into the studio are you thinking I am going to take this to the next level?  No. Going into the studio we practice we perform. Instead of going in and thinking OK we got a try to you know satisfy this demographic. Or we have to let our fans that liked our last stuff feel familiar and comfortable with stuff. We just realized that you know hey if we follow our instincts and work hard that wherever - what the result of these recordings takes us then we feel pretty good and satisfied with that.  And if it is a total flop so be it.  Yeah.  All right.  But we do not be doing no flopping though. No it is not that.   I just had to throw that in there.  Right yeah sure. So the production on this record is really kind of shimmering and echo-y. It is almost like a dream state sometimes. I mean how do you want the listener to feel when this music kind of washes over them?  It is like these sort of opposing feelings like utter relaxation and tension confusion and certainty joy and also the timbers of anguish and pain history futurism. But everything is an attempt to expand the now to get inside of the moment that you are in and see how far you can stretch it in in whatever direction.   I am speaking with Ishmael Butler from the group Shabazz Palaces. The forthcoming album is called Lese Majesty. Why do I keep not knowing how to say that?  You have got to have confidence. You said it right. It is all good.  The forthcoming album is called Lese Majesty. I have read that in high school and college you were a basketball player.  It is true.  You went on a scholarship even to the University of Massachusetts.  Yes and played for great John Caliperri who now coaches Kentucky.  Wow and then you stopped playing basketball and...  I did.  And spent your time on music. How - tell us how you got started in music.  I am from Seattle Washington. I went to Meany Middle School. And in Meany we had a music teacher jazz band teacher named Mr. Irving - Wadey Irving . He was a beautiful charismatic and attentive imaginative teacher who really was - showed us music in a way that basically stuck with me for the rest of my life. And that introduction slid me along a path that I am really grateful to have been introduced to at that time in my life. So I started playing alto saxophone in the fifth grade.  And then with your old band the Digable Planets you you know mixed jazz with hip-hop pretty famously. Is their jazz in the music of Shabazz Palaces as well? It seems like you might want to call it something else like more ambient or minimalist.  Yeah I do not want to call it anything. I mean there is jazz in it in the sense that I think there is a confidence an instinct and capturing instinct and improvisation and impulse and letting it stand. And in that sense I feel like it has a jazz sensibility for sure.  Right. You know I know that you said when you go into the studio you are not trying to like fit some genre or target some demographic. But when you hear something like the fact that your band is being called the future of hip-hop what do you think about that? How do you respond to that?  I feel proud. It is exciting because you know this rap world is this endeavor that I pursue. And Shabazz Palaces - make no mistake like this is an attack. And we are trying to show off and really stun on all other rappers. You know and let them know that this is our style this is what we do and we are ready to put it up against anybody else's stuff. You know so it feels good to you know move people and have people say cool stuff about our music.   Meanwhile plots and capers lots of flavor lots of paper. Watch your neighbor wondering who is really faking.  Ishmael Butler is one of the creative forces behind the band Shabazz Palaces. The new album comes out on the 29. It is called Lese Majesty.
