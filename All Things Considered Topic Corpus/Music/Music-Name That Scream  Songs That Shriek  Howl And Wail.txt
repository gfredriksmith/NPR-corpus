 Finally this hour we are going to hear from a 25-year-old named LeRoy Stevens. He loves screams the kind singers make. He thinks so highly of these wild passionate displays of vocal skill that he has collected 74 screams and put them together in one continuous three-and-a-half-minute composition. Mr.  So I went to every record store in Manhattan and asked the employee or owner there for their favorite scream from music. They filled out these forms. And from those forms I then found that song isolated the scream and then composed the track.       Mr.  You just heard T.V. Eye by the Stooges Man Out of Time by Elvis Costello and We Will not Get Fooled Again by the Who.             Mr.  Psycho by the Sonics A Change is Going to Come by Baby Huey Shoplifting by the Slits Lifeline by Husker Du Meadows by Joe Walsh and Side Four by Roland Kirk. But one of the great things about this project was - by all these different stores that I went to they all carried different genres. So I was introduced to a lot of different music.     Mr.  That was Opening of Door Five from Bluebeard's Castle by Bela Bartok and Elektra by Richard Strauss. I mean I think every artist brings something to it something unique to it based on their vocal ability. I mean I tend to like the high-pitched kind of like  That kind of   Screams from scream enthusiast LeRoy Stevens. That last batch consisted of John Lennon the Small Faces and Ralph Neilson and the Chancellors. These screams and many - believe us many more were collected by Stevens on his limited edition vinyl recording called Favorite Recorded Scream.
