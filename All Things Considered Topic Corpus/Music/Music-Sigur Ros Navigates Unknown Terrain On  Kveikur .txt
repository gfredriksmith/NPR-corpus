  This music is from the latest album from the Icelandic band Sigur Ros. They are known for atmospheric moods and expansive soundscapes. Their seventh album is called Kveikur and critic Tom Moon has a review.  It is always been tricky to find the focal point in the music of Sigur Ros.   Where to focus? On these swirling droning pools of sound in the foreground or the pulse that is making a slow menacing approach from way in the back? Even when singer Jonsi gets going he does not always claim center stage.   Sigur Ros delights in shifting the listener's perspective. Even its anthems avoid the conventional rock plod. With this album the band's majestic if usually mellow vistas acquire a distinctly harsh edge. The textures are darker the harmonies more dissonant. The band's graceful soaring melodies seem to rise out of a dense sonic murk.   Not everything is tense. Perhaps recognizing that a full album of this stuff might grow tedious Sigur Ros offers a few bright pop moments including this one which has a Human League-style hook sung of course in Icelandic.   But that track is an exception. On most of this record there are no obvious points of entry no directional indicators. Sigur Ros creates sound with mystery in it. It is kind of like navigating unknown terrain at night. Recognizing that not everything will be instantly discernible you sort of have to relax and let your senses adjust to the surroundings which it turns out are invariably riveting.   That is our critic Tom Moon reviewing the new album from Sigur Ros.
