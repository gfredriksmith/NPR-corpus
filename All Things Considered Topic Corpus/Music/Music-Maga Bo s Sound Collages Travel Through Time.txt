 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Maga Bo is an American-born music producer who is spent the past 12 years living in Brazil and observing its music. His passion is traditional vocals and percussion and there is plenty of both in Brazil. On his latest album he juxtaposes indigenous Brazilian roots music and high-tech production. Banning Eyre has our review.   That metallic buzz you hear is the one-stringed Brazilian berimbau. In Brazil it provides the characteristic accompaniment for an expressive martial art form called capoeira.   In producer Maga Bo's world berimbau becomes an element in a time-traveling collage of organic sounds. On this album Quilombo do Futuro vibrating strings booming drumheads and vocal melodies that might go back centuries coexist with rhythmic sound effects and club-friendly beats.   Maga Bo records traditional artists playing capoeira coco samba maculele and other rootsy Brazilian genres. Then he constructs spacious layered mixes that sound modern but keep the indigenous sounds in the foreground. On this track racing snare drum rhythms provide the backing for dancehall vocals by MC Zulu.   On one track Maga Bo incorporates the pendulous rhythms of the Brazilian northeast once excluded from the country's popular culture. Listen to the seductive sensuality of this groove and you will understand why northeast music has become a sensation among Brazilian music fans in recent years.   The word quilombo in the album title originally referred to an autonomous community established by runaway slaves in colonial Brazil. Quilombos were places of both physical and spiritual refuge. By calling this album Quilombo do Futuro the quilombo of the future Maga Bo defines a kind of virtual refuge for traditional culture giving it a welcome place in the techy global music soundscape of the 21st century.
