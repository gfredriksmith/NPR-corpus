 Johnny Smith was revered by guitar players in rock country and jazz. Jazz is where Smith honed his craft. He had one of the best-selling jazz records of the 1950s. His version of Moonlight in Vermont.   Johnny Smith died Tuesday evening at his home in Colorado Springs just two weeks shy of his 92nd birthday. NPR's Tom Cole tells us about Smith's career and the song that made it possible.  This is the version of Walk Do not Run you might remember.   The Ventures recorded their hit after hearing Chet Atkins play it.   Chet heard it on a 1954 Johnny Smith recording.   Smith had been in New York about five years when he wrote Walk Do not Run. He was one of the most in-demand guitarists in the city a staff musician at the NBC radio network playing with orchestras and leading his own bands alongside the beboppers on 52nd Street.   Here's Smith just two years ago from the Smithsonian oral history interview.   He was born in Alabama and his family travelled the South looking for work during the Great Depression. They eventually settled in Portland Maine and he set a high bar for what he wanted his guitar to do.   Smith used chords to move with the melody creating a luxurious liquid sound that is been the envy of guitarists ever since.   Johnny Smith also designed guitars for Guild and Gibson. One of them is at the Smithsonian. But at the height of his career Smith's wife died and he could not keep up his relentless schedule and care for his 5-year-old daughter. So in 1958 he packed everything up and moved to Colorado where he opened a music store. In the end the modest innovator was happy with his life as a family man.   Tom Cole NPR News.
