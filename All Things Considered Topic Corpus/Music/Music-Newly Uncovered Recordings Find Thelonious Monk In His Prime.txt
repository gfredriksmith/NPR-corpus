 In July 1959 jazz pianist and composer Thelonious Monk recorded music for a film. Nearly 30 minutes of his work was featured in the French film Les Liasisons Dangereuses. The master tapes have just been released and reviewer Tom Moon says they offer a listen to a jazz visionary at his peak.   French cinema had a brief torrid fling with jazz in the late 1950s. It was largely driven by music supervisor Marcel Romano who in 1958 hired Miles Davis to improvise the shadowy soundtrack to Elevator To The Gallows. The next year he lined up Thelonious Monk for Dangerous Liaisons. A hit in Europe the picture proved controversial in the U.S. because of its twisted love plot. Monk's angular questioning music added low-level tension.   When Monk arrived at the session on a Monday in July of 1959 he discovered that Romano had prepared a list of cues. They only had one day to record so the pressure was on. Those plans went out the window almost immediately as Monk and his crew ripped through some of his well-known compositions.   The playing throughout is lively and spirited. Monk scampers around the piano finding delight in every register jabbing at chords in ways that jolt his rhythm section. He took a few left turns that day too.   Among them is this tender version of the hymn We will Understand It Better By And By.   There is no clear explanation for why this music was not released at the time. The producer of the new set speculates it might have been a contractual glitch. Like many vault discoveries this soundtrack does not rewrite history but it does enhance our appreciation of genius.   Here's Monk at a time when his notions about sound and improvisation were expanding the very language of jazz. He is doing what he probably did most days in 1959 - playing high-wire solo and small group pieces on a decent piano chasing brilliance like it was no big deal.   The just-released Thelonious Monk album is called Les Liaisons Dangereuses 1960. Our reviewer is Tom Moon.
