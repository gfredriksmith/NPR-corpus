  You are listening to a piece of music by Mozart that until now was not heard for more than 200 years. It was found in the collections of the International Mozarteum Foundation in Salzburg. It is an early work a very early work in fact. Researchers believe Mozart composed this piece when he was just seven or eight years old.   Scholars say the music is written in the hand of Mozart's father Leopold. But because of what they call technical mistakes clumsy moments it could not possibly be Leopold's composition. They figure the young Mozart did not know musical notation so he asked dad for help. Today the music came to life once more played for the first time in public on Mozart's own piano in a house where he once lived.
