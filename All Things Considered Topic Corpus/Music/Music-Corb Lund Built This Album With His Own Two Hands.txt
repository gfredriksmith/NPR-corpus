 The back-story to the new album from Canadian singersongwriter Corb Lund sounds like a classic country music song. Lund built a cabin in rural Alberta with his longtime girlfriend and his favorite uncle. He finished the cabin but the girlfriend ultimately left and his uncle died. Snowed in for weeks at a time Lund emerged with Cabin Fever the title of his new CD. Meredith Ochs has this review.   For you city dwellers who dream of moving to the country buying some cattle and becoming gentleman farmers one day Corb Lund offers this cautionary tale. It is more bitter than sweet with a touch of Western swing - Western Canada that is.   As a fourth-generation rancher Corb Lund knows better than to romanticize life on a farm. He is not especially inclined to write about anything romantic without a large measure of darkness which might explain his lengthy tenure in a metal band before embarking on a solo country career. But as a songwriter Lund finds glory in tough work spotting characters most people would overlook and celebrating them with colorful sketches like this one.   Guns and graves bovines and bikers whiskey and women - in the hands of another songwriter all these references might sound cliched. But on Corb Lund's new CD it rarely feels gratuitous and that is impressive. It is because he is experienced much of what he sings about. Rural living is not easy as Lund shows and that is why it makes for such great songs.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
