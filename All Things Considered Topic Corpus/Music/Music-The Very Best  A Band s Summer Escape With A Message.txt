 Finally this hour techno pop from London with roots in Sweden and Malawi. This very international music group is called The Very Best. The collaboration began when a Swedish producer met a singer from Malawi in a London thrift shop. Reviewer Banning Eyre says their new album is an alluring summer escape with a message.   The high-tech pop intro to The Very Best's song Kondaine suggests a carefree summer party. There is Afro-pop uplift in the sound and top 40 melodiousness in the vocal.   The lyrics mix English and Chichewa - that is Malawi's official language - and tell an absurdly frightening tale of a witch doctor's potion. In the song's video three musicians partake in a gory animal sacrifice ritual in an African village at the end of which they turn into goats. That' sun and fun in the sound but the problems and ambiguities of African life in nearly every lyric. Like this song I Wanna Go Away which talks about escaping life amid civil war.   The Very Best is a fusion of African rhythm and melody and cutting-edge pop and dance music. Founders Johan Hugo and Esau Mwamwaya started out with a successful mixed tape posted on a blog. They followed up with a strong debut CD and now MTMTMK. The band has yet to reveal the meaning of this title but we do know the basic tracks were recorded in Esau's hometown Lilongwe.   The songs on the album range from folksy melodies like this one to dense reggae pumping techno club grooves and quirky pop songs. There are some impressive cameos including from Toronto-based Somali rapper K'Naan.   This song We OK perfectly expresses The Very Best's bold ethic. Even amid poverty warfare and the privations of ghetto life happiness is possible. You have heard of Afro-pessimism? Well  savvy in tune with life paradoxical perhaps but in the hands of The Very Best hard to resist.   Banning Eyre is senior editor at afropop.org. He reviewed the album MTMTMK by The Very Best.
