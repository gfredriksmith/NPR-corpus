  Yesterday we asked you to tweet us your suggestions for a Brexit playlist.    Should I stay or should I go?  Lots of you suggested this number by The Clash and we have to say yes we did think about this song. But it seemed like a pre-referendum tune rather than a breakup song.    So you got to let me know. Should I stay or should I go?  Here are some more of your suggestions. And by the way we opened it up to all singers not just Brits.    I think we are alone now. There does not seem to be anyone around.    Wake me up before you go-go. Do not leave me hanging on like a yo-yo. Wake me up before you go-go. I do not want to miss it when you hit that high.    Do not do not you want me? You know I cannot believe it when I hear that you will not see me.    Hey hey hey. Oh.  We will be back with more Brexit mix later in the show.    Do not you try and pretend. It is my feeling we will win in the end...
