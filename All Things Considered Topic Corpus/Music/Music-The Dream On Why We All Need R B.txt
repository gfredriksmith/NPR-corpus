 Finally this hour new music from the songwriter Terius Nash. He goes by the stage name The-Dream. And over the past decade he is had a hand in some of the biggest pop songs on the Billboard chart.   Justin Bieber's Baby Rihanna's Umbrella Beyonce's Single Ladies -  the list goes on. But when The-Dream writes music for himself he says he always comes back to RB. TERIUS ''THE-DREAM''  RB is a conversation that you should be able to sit down and have.   Rhythm and blues is based on love and heartbreak. So you need it because that is real life.   The-Dream's new album is called IV Play. That is the Roman numeral IV by the way. And here he is talking about a track off the album called Too Early.  You are having an argument and it is 6 p.m. And you have a good chance of getting over that argument and it is going to be OK by the time you go to sleep. But too early in the morning means when you wait till that hour - like if something's been bothering you and you wait till like 2 a.m. - and then you want to start the argument it is just too early I guess. It is - it is going to set the tempo for the next day. And it is just - that is tiresome in itself. It is like oh God. So that is what this song is. It is too early in the morning to break up then make out.     It is too early in the morning to break up and then to make out. It is way late for pretending. It is time to stop now...  That is Terius Nash also known as The-Dream talking about the song Too Early from his latest album IV Play.   Youre listening to ALL PR News.
