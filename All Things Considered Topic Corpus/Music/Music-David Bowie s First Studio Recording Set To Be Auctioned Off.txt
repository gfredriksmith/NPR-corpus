 Before Ziggy Stardust before Major Tom David Bowie was a 16-year-old known as David Jones. And he was a member of a band called the Konrads.  Now that was 55 years ago. A piece of that history will soon go up for auction. It is Bowie's first ever studio recording. The band's former drummer found it in his grandfather's garage loft. Here's auctioneer Paul Fairweather.  He was clearing his loft and he found the tape recorder along with very interesting items of memorabilia in a bread basket.  That is right - in a bread basket. Also along with that demo were some of Bowie's early letters drawings and photos.  Fairweather says the recording is a great track. The auction house has only released 12 seconds of it. It is called I Never Dreamed.    I never dreamed that I would fall in love with you.  Well for a professional opinion we asked NPR Music editor Andrew Flanagan for his first reaction.  It was profound disappointment .  By the way then David Jones was actually a sax player with the Konrads. The band thought he would sound better leading the vocals on I Never Dreamed.  The song sounds so bad first of all because we only have 12 seconds of it recorded to acetate which has not held up very well for 55 years. So it is a very scratchy not very high-fidelity recording. But the song itself is pretty boring kind of U.K. pop-rock of the time. It sounds like something you would kind of hear in a commercial for Marmite.  Ouch.  Well as scratchy and boring as the demo may be it is still expected to sell for at least 11000. And auctioneer Paul Fairweather says it is historically significant for David Bowie's fans.  This was his first taste of going into a recording studio to record a track. And you know on the back of that he became quite ambitious as to what he wanted to achieve in his life and was really the opening of the door to what things could be like.   The demo recording will be up for auction in September.
