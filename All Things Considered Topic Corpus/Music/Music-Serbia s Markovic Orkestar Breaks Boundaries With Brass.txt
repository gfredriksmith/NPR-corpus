 Balkan brass music is made up of fast-paced danceable party songs. One of the top bands of the genre is led by Serbia's Boban Markovic. His son Marko joined the band and has helped update their sound. A new collection called Golden Horns offers the best of what is now the Boban i Marko Markovic Orkestar. Reviewer Banning Eyre says it takes us on a wild ride.   If you are planning a wedding and looking for music that is fresh irresistible and completely unexpected you might want to go Eastern European with a cutting edge brass band from southern Serbia.   This number is actually a traditional song interpreted by the incomparable Boban i Marko Markovic Orkestar. You want to hear the group's more experimental side? Check out the jazzy pomp of Dzumbus Funk. That is Chaos Funk in English.   Trumpeter Boban Markovic started out leading a local village band and soon found himself at the crest of a Balkan brass music wave in the 1990s. Original songs like Khelipe E Cheasa proved surprisingly successful on dance floors throughout Europe.   From childhood Boban's son Marko practiced like a maniac up to 10 hours a day and he debuted with the band at 14. A decade later Marko is the band's star soloist and lead arranger bringing fresh ideas and energy to his dad's joyful enterprise. Marko even raps when the spirit moves him as in this song about plum brandy.   Balkan music is demanding to play - fast precise and rhythmically complex. These guys are talented enough and brave enough to slip in elements of jazz funk or Latin music with ease. So next wedding take along a copy of Golden Horns and slip it to the deejay. If it is not the high point of the party it can only mean they have run out of plum brandy.   Banning Eyre is senior editor at AfroPop.org.
