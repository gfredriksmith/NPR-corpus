 Ask musicians to name someone they regard as visionary and you are likely to hear the name Flying Lotus. The record producer conceptual artist rapper and label head built a reputation for dense collages of sound. And in the five years since his last album he is worked with everyone from Kendrick Lamar to Herbie Hancock and Solange Knowles.    Sure it did not matter sure it did not matter go on.  That is Solange on the latest album from Flying Lotus. It is a 67-minute opus called Flamagra. Tom Moon has our review.   Step right up and prepare to be amazed by strange blink-and-you-miss-them concatenations of sound beamed directly from the mind of Flying Lotus.   There are 27 tracks on this album some last just a minute or a little longer. Rather than make typical verse-chorus songs Steven Ellison goes for curious eerie environments.   It is part of how he is rethinking that outdated construct the long-playing album. Ellison grew up in a musical family. His great aunt was keyboardist Alice Coltrane. He says that when he is writing these scenes his goal is to create stuff that freaks him out.   .  Flamagra plays like a high-speed chase through a carnival fun house - a sideshow attraction of the mind. Turn a corner and you might find yourself deep in a disorienting escape room maze.   Walk a little further and you encounter George Clinton leading a team of digital munchkins through a surreal production number.    Now help yourself. I know something that they do not know. Better watch your step. I know something that they do not know.  Somehow despite the short vignettes and detours Flamagra hangs together. It unfolds in a cinematic way with rousing moments followed by quiet ones followed by brain-scrambling bits of beat programming. There may be an overarching message in there somewhere - not sure that it matters. Sometimes it is enough to just take the journey through the fun house.  The latest from Flying Lotus is called Flamagra. Our reviewer is Tom Moon.
