 Well we did say we had more Brexit mix for you. That is our U.K.-EU breakup playlist in case you missed it earlier. We asked you to tweet us some tunes and did you ever deliver. Hit it.    You were something I cannot replace. You made my heart work. You make me stronger. I am not letting go. I am not letting go.    We are never ever ever getting back together. We are never ever ever...    Sometimes you cannot make it on your own. Sometimes you cannot make it. Best you can do is to fake it.    I know it is over still I cling. I do not know where else I can go.    Here I go again on my own going down the only road I have ever known.    But do not look back in anger I heard you say.    Things as not what they used to - there is a lot we used to - things as not what they used to be.  Thanks to everyone who helped us out. It is been fun.
