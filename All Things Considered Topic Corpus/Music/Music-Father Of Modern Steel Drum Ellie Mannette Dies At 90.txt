 If you bang on a metal can most people only hear a racket. Ellie Mannette heard much more.   Ellie Mannette the father of the modern steel drum the national instrument of Trinidad and Tobago has died. He was born in Trinidad in 1927 and banged on oil barrels as a teenager.   But he imagined a symphony.   I listened to classical music all day. And I always say to myself one of these days I am going to build a symphony of steel all steel drum to sound as good or better than that symphony that I am hearing on the radio.  He took his vision and using the skills learned working at a foundry he tweaked the surfaces of metal cans. Eventually he could use his new drums to make a melody.   They could play like a...   Ellie Mannette founded a group the Invaders Steel Orchestra with two of his brothers. As his invention caught on he left Trinidad to travel to play and to teach. In 1963 he was asked to help develop the United States Navy Steel Band. Four years later he would made the U.S. his home. He settled in Morgantown W.Va. making it the epicenter of steel drums in the U.S. He started an instrument business there and trained students at West Virginia University. Some of them have since built their own steel drum programs at other schools. That was his hope when he spoke to NPR in 2002.   Because this instrument is going to blossom. And for me to fade away or retire die tomorrow with the skills in my hands and in my mind it will be a loss for the art form. And these young people's going to take it on and they are going to move with it. And I expect them to carry on my work for the future. I expect that to happen.  Ellie Mannette was a member of the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame and a recipient of the NEA National Heritage Fellowship award. He died last week in Morgantown of kidney failure. His former students and apprentices say they plan to keep his steel drum business open.
