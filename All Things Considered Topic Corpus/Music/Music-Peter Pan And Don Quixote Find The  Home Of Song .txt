 Finally this hour some music suitable for children. Our kid's music critic Stefan Shepherd has this review of an album that draws inspiration from popular works of literature.  I remember my youthful summers as a time of reading and exploration diving into books seeing new places and rediscovering nearby ones.   After listening to Home of Song the debut family music album from Minneapolis singer Paul Spring I think we spent summers in much the same way.   That is Peter Pan one of a few tracks drawing inspiration from classic literature. Peter and Wendy join Sherlock Holmes and Don Quixote as characters in song.   Growing up one of 10 children raised by two college literature professors Spring says they were a family united by reading. They spent many years living along the Mississippi River in Winona Minnesota and so the river itself - and of course Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn - all make appearances on this album.   Paul Spring who is now a high-school English teacher draws as much inspiration from his own childhood as he does from Mark Twain and Cervantes. Home of Song is an ode to books and stories and families that nurture them. I do not know if the family who reads and sings together stays together but albums like this one make a convincing argument.   The album Home of Song is by Paul Spring.
