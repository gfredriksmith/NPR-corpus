 SECRET AGENT 23   It is time for a road trip my family and me. Out on the roadway no place I would rather be.  Yes this is it. It is your Fourth of July road trip playlist. Yesterday we asked you to tell us which songs you would like to hear when you are cruising down the highway. We received many great suggestions. So whether you are just sitting out just got stuck in traffic already at your destination or not going anywhere and you just want to escape through some tunes crank it up. Enjoy.    Get out the map. Get out the map and lay your finger anywhere down.    Running on empty. Running blind.    Windows are rolled down. Sun is setting high.    Hanging out the passenger side of his best friend's ride trying to holler at me.    Riders on the storm. Riders on the storm.    Just get off of that LA freeway without getting killed or caught.    Moving right along we found a life on the highway.   And your way is my way.   So trust my navigation.    Moving through places space and time. Got a lot of things I got to do. But Lord willing I am coming back to you my baby boo . I am a traveling man.    I have got to find a road back. I have got to find a road.    From the Kentucky coal mine to the California sun Bobby shared the secrets of my soul.    So can I get a window seat? Do not want nobody next to me.    It is time to leave this town. It is time to steal away. Let us go get lost anywhere in the USA.    Hit the road jack and do not you come back no more no more no more no more. Hit the road jack.    Country roads take me home.    The point of no return. Oh oh. Oh oh.  If you want the whole Spotify playlist follow us at npratc. That is it for us for Sunday. This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Michel Martin. We are back next Saturday. We hope you have a great Fourth of July.
