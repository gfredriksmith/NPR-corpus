 And our reviewer Tom Manoff says Hamelin has a special ability to reveal Haydn's originality.  The word that comes to mind listening to Marc-Andre Hamelin play Haydn is delight.  VIVACE MOLTO  Many of these sonatas have been neglected by the world's famous pianists because most of them were composed for amateurs not virtuosos. So from a technical viewpoint they are easy. But Haydn's so-called easy piano music was fertile ground for his genius and in these sonatas we hear the composer's core musical gifts of melody harmony and form.  ALLEGRO  When he was nearing 60 Haydn fell in love with an amateur pianist who admired his music. She was married however and also from the nobility. So things stayed platonic but passion can heat up in music as in the one sonata he wrote for his unattainable amour.   It is always interesting when a pianist of this stature steps outside the virtuosic repertory. The message is that there is something special here something missed perhaps in music history. And Hamelin' never overplayed to make the music seem more difficult but never underplayed when the composer's intentions call for some muscle. From lyrical proclamations to high-minded fun the way Marc-Andre Hamelin plays Haydn makes him one of the foremost interpreters of the composer's piano music today.   The piano sonatas are Haydn's performed by Marc-Andre Hamelin in his second volume of Haydn sonatas. Our reviewer is Tom Manoff.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
