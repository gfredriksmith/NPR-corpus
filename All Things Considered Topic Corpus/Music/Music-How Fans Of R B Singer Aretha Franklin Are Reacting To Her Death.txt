 And the tributes for Aretha Franklin have been pouring in from all corners. President Trump praised her before starting a Cabinet meeting at the White House. President Obama tweeted this message. Aretha helped define the American experience. In her voice we could feel our history all of it and in every shade.  And in Franklin's hometown Detroit fans came to the Motown Museum to pay their respects. For local Dajuanna Travier Aretha Franklin was a symbol of strength.  For all women man or no man. Basically she did not have to have someone on her shoulder to validate her presence.  Chris Ardrey of Columbus Ohio was there too. He says the world has lost more than a great voice.  Some parts of America do not understand everything that we fought for - civil rights culture. Losing a voice like Aretha - was a voice that stood for a lot of what those philosophies are ingrained in. And to lose her is losing a little bit of humanity.  Fans in Detroit remembering the queen of soul today. Aretha Franklin was 76.    Together together that is how it must be. To live without you would only mean heartbreak for me.
