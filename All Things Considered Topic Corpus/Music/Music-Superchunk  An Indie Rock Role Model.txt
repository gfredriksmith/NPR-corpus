 2010 is looking to be a good year for the indie rock band Superchunk. It marks the 21st anniversary of the band and the label they started Merge Records. Merge is having its best year ever on the album charts while Superchunk has released its first new album in almost a decade. Here's our critic Will Hermes with his review of Majesty Shredding.   Back in the '90s Superchunk defined the sound and the ethos of indie rock with a self-released single called Slack Mo- something I cannot say on broadcast radio.     working for you.  Thats not an anthem for laziness. Just the opposite  I am workin' but I am not workin' for you.  This year the band's business offspring Merge Records had three Top 10 albums by Spoon She  Him and most recently The Arcade Fire who scored the label's very first number one hit. After 21 years together Superchunk are role models for these youngsters and a whole generation of indie rock acts.   But I am glad that between marketing meetings and raising families they are still making great music themselves.    .  Yet Superchunk 2010 does not sound entirely different from Superchunk 1992. The melodies are still wound so tight they sound ready to break. Mac McCaughan's voice still sounds like a bullied twerp finally pushed to his limit. And the guitars those beautiful guitars still lurch and squeal like hair-metal dudes in a drunken cat fight.   Majesty Shredding which Superchunk could have just as soon called Shredding Majesty  the pomp and spectacle of marketplace rock 'n' roll turned inside-out to show the seams exposing the men and women behind the curtain who are not much different than the rest of us.    .  Is it calculated artistic posturing just like the guys in leather pants do? Sure. But it is also apparently a sustainable lifestyle. And I hope Superchunk keep it going long enough to show their grandkids how it is done.    Do not touch me. .  The new album from Superchunk is called Majesty Shredding. Our reviewer is Will Hermes.
