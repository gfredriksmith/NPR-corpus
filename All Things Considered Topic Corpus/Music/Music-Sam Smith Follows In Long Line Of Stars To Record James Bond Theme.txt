 Sam Smith first melted hearts with his song Stay With Me.    Oh will not you stay with me 'ecause you are all I need.  Now he is recorded the theme to the new James Bond movie Spectre. The song is called Writing's On The Wall. He is following in some big footsteps - Shirley Bassey sang Goldfinger.    Goldfinger - he is the man the man with the Midas touch.  Madonna sang the theme for the 2002 Bond movie Die Another Day.    I guess I will die another day. I guess I will die another day another day. I guess I will die another day.  And Tina Turner performed the GoldenEye theme.    Goldeneye I found his weakness. Goldeneye he will do what I please.  Most recently Adele added her voice to the Bond repertoire.    Let the sky fall. When it crumbles we will stand tall.  Her Sky Fall won an Academy Award a Golden Globe and a Grammy. There was a lot of speculation about who would be singing the theme for the new Bond movie Spectre. Sam Smith told the BBC he is happy the secret's out. He thought he was pretty good at keeping his identity under wraps like the superspy himself.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
