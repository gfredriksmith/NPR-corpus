 Noah Gundersen examines spirituality in his music in a particularly raw and intense way. He is 26 and was raised in such a devout household that he was not allowed to hear secular music as a child. Now he explores faith in his lyrics. Meredith Ochs has this review of his latest album Carry The Ghost.    I think I heard a good man say God is love and love has made us. But have you seen the news today? I have and I think God has gone away if he was ever there anyway. 'ecause anyone that tells you they were born good is lying. We are just born and we are dying. And I know it is been said but mothers be good to your daughters and when they are older sons be good to your fathers.  On his new album Noah Gundersen treads the rocky emotional and philosophical terrain of wrestling with faith. He struggles to make sense of the belief system he grew up with sometimes using colorful metaphors sometimes being direct.    Every Sunday I would sit in your row praying that one day you would finally notice. Now that I am older I finally see you were the worst and the best thing that happened to me. Oh show me the light.  With his evocative singing as the centerpiece and very minimal accompaniment his songs are as intimate as a confessional.    If you lived in the shadow of the mountain would you notice when the mountain was gone? If you played in the sparkling fountain would the drought seem twice as long?  Mostly quiet and pensive Noah Gundersen's new album is a slow burn but his imaginative lyrics and soul-baring melodies are engaging. His music pulls you in whether he is searching for God or for love or just for how to be a man.    I do not want no jealous love honey I have had enough of it all my life bringing me down.  Meredith Ochs is a talk show host and deejay at Sirius XM Radio. She reviewed Carry The Ghost by Noah Gundersen.    So many words but nothing left to sing. I want it better than I have ever had. I want it better...
