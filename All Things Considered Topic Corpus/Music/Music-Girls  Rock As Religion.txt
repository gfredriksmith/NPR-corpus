 Girls is the name of a rock band that in fact includes no girls. Their eclectic sound however includes a wide range of rock styles and our critic Will Hermes thinks their latest effort is one of the year's best rock records.    How can I say I want you now that you have said I want you. Now that you have said everything I said to you to somebody new.  The new Girls album is titled Father Son Holy Ghost and if you are guessing it is a tell-all about his upbringing in the so-called religious cult called the Children of God you would be incorrect. But back story aside it is an extraordinary record especially its first single which Owens titled also more figuratively than literally Vomit.      As far as I can tell Father Son Holy Ghost is an album about secular love historically the topic of numerous rock scriptures. And rock history is definitely on Christopher Owens' mind from the Dark Side of the Moon style organ swells and gospel vocals of Vomit to the wicked surf guitar riffs on the song Honey Bunny.    I know you are out there. You might be right around the corner and you will be the girl that I love.  To the searing guitar jams on the simply titled Die which was inspired by a Fleetwood Mac song from that band's early days as a psychedelic blues-rock outfit.   It is also because his sound soulfulness melodies and provocations are simply more compelling than those of most of his peers. It is rock that feels transformative rather than recycled and these days that is something very special.   The band is called Girls. Their new album is Father Son Holy Ghost.
