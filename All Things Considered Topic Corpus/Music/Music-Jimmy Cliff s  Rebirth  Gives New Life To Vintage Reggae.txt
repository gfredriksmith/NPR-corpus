 Forty years ago reggae music gained popularity in the United States with the film The Harder They Come and its soundtrack. The singer Jimmy Cliff was the star of both. Today at age 64 Cliff has a new album out called Rebirth that harkens back to his early days. Our critic Will Hermes has this review.  Twenty-first century pop music has been flush with precise recreations of '60s and '70s American RB. Think of Sharon Jones Adele Raphael Saadiq and the late Amy Winehouse. Meanwhile I have been waiting for a similar revival of Jamaica's RB ska rock steady and roots reggae. Jimmy Cliff's new record is exactly that.   In the decades since Bob Marley and Peter Tosh died Jimmy Cliff has been the last man standing of reggae's first great international warriors. Frankly he is made a lot of lukewarm crossover LPs over the years but he finally decided to rewind his sound with the producer Tim Armstrong the singer from the punk band Rancid. He is a huge Jimmy Cliff fan and he helped nail that old school sound everywhere on this record even on a cover of his own song Rancid's Ruby Soho.   There are other good covers here too notably the Clash's Guns of Brixton which mentions Ivanhoe Martin the hardscrabble character Cliff played in the movie The Harder They Come.   Cliff's originals here are just as exciting and they do not seem stuck in the past like Children's Bread a song about poor folks and thievery that I think would play quite well in an Occupy encampment.   As a pop music fan of a certain age I have to check myself when shouting out records that echo period sounds. Really I am as excited by Frank Ocean's next generation RB as the next guy but good is good killer is killer and if anyone should be able to reanimate the vintage Jamaican music I hear bumping out of every hipster coffee shop in town Jimmy Cliff is the man.   The new album from Jimmy Cliff is called Rebirth. Our reviewer Will Hermes is author of the book Love Goes to Buildings on Fire.
