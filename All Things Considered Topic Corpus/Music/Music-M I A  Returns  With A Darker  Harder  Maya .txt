 Oliver Wang is our reviewer and he says while it is far from her best work the record still proves that M.I.A is an artist who is work is unparalleled.  Listeners could have reached that same conclusion in about four bars.    I do not wanna talk about money 'ecause I got it. And I do not wanna talk about hoochies 'ecause I been it. And I do not wanna be that fake 'ecause you can do it.  My experience with every new M.I.A.  the pre- release is so fever-pitched I feel exhausted before I hear even a single song and then I slip in some earbuds touch play and my head promptly explodes. This is a good thing.    .  Unlike the brighter tones on M.I.A.'s last album Kala much of Maya pushes you down into dark basement clubs where her producers serve up glitchy noisy beats that careen between cold concrete walls.    .  It is these moments which make other songs on Maya so surprisingly off- note. Perhaps befitting her growing mainstream stature a few tracks feature the kind of post-disco electro-beats and studio-tweaked vocals that seem better suited to artists such as Robyn Keha or even Katy Perry. This is not a good thing.    .  Despite these lapses the rest of the album highlights what is compelling about her voice. It is not her range or clarity really it is not but rather her distinctively piercing timbre with its exotic mash of Kingston patois Bristol brogue and Brooklyn swagger.    .  But through their songs the better ones craft personas that fill the needs of listeners whether for sensitive poets or sexy cheerleaders. M.I.A. is a self- styled third-world rabble-rouser and whatever the distance between the life she leads and the life she sings the sonic force of her music feels as real as we want it to be.   The artist is M.I.A. Reviewer Oliver Wang runs the audio blog Soul- Sides.com
