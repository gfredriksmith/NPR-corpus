   I want to break free. I want to break free.  We are spending a lot of time on today's program talking about the Brexit decision and it got us thinking about songs reflecting people's sentiments across the pond right now. We do not have a special relationship with one side or the other. Without further ado we give you a Brexit playlist.    God knows I want to break free.    You say yes. I say no. You say slow. I say go go go.    With or without you. With or without you oh.    You can go your own way. You can go your own way.    Do not leave me this way. I do not understand how I am at your command so baby please. Do not you leave me this way.    Do not you want me baby? Do not you want me oh.    I never wanted it to end up this way. You have only got yourself to blame.    You try to make me forget who I really am. Do not tell me I know that. I am not the same as all the rest. I am the one and only. Nobody I would rather be.  Breaking up is hard to do. If you can think of other songs to explain the Brexit vote send us a tweet npratc BrexitMix. Maybe we will play some of your jams on the program tomorrow.    I am the one and only nobody I would rather be. I am the one and only cannot take that away...
