 Nels Cline from Wilco plays epic guitar solos.   Away from Wilco Nels Cline tends to avoid the spotlight. He makes arty records with a free jazz sensibility - until now. His latest release is an exploration of romance. It is called Lovers and Tom Moon has our review.   Nels Cline says he is been working out the details of this record for 25 years. It is a set of love songs dating from Tin Pan Alley days to the present featuring his guitar surrounded by a sultry studio orchestra.   Cline was inspired to learn guitar as a kid growing up in Los Angeles when he heard Jimi Hendrix play Manic Depression. But he regards the late jazz legend Jim Hall as a towering influence. Throughout this record he emulates Hall's distinctive liquid tone and graceful way with the melody.   Cline treats these melodies with great reverence. He plays them straight resisting jazz abstraction or rock star showmanship. This sense of message discipline gives his original tunes a classic sound.   On this one called Hairpin And Hatbox he updates chord progressions used by Irving Berlin.   Nels Cline describes himself as a quote fake jazz guy and not-all-the-way-rock guy. From this in-between state he is crafted moody understated texture-rich music. It is as though the years spent refining the idea led Nels Cline to a simple conclusion. The best way to play music for lovers is to sound like one.   The latest from Nels Cline is called Lovers. Our reviewer is Tom Moon.
