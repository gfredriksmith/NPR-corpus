 And now a moment of honesty.  We feel like we know you. And when we asked you to help us build a road trip playlist a few weeks ago we already had an idea what songs you would recommend.    Hit the road Jack and do not you come back no more no more no more no more. Hit the road Jack and do not you come back no more. What you say?  That song is a no-brainer - Hit The Road Jack by Ray Charles - as is this song.    On the road again. Just cannot wait to get on the road again.  Yep Willie Nelson. It was not fate people. It was obvious. On The Road Again is a classic driving song.  As is this rock ballad a hit in 1976 and again in '92.    I see a little silhouetto of a man. Scaramouche scaramouche will you do the fandango? Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening.  Do not be frightened. That of course is Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen.  And yes we knew it would show up repeatedly among the thousands of suggestions you sent in for our road trip playlist.  But this next song did catch us by surprise.    I am on my way and I will not turn back. I am on my way and I will not turn back.  That is Barbara Dane a social activist and musician. In the late 1950s jazz critic Leonard Feather called her Bessie Smith in stereo.    I am on my way. Do not you know I am on my way? But I would ask my brother why do not you go with me?  I am On My Way is from Living with the Blues a 1959 album Barbara Dane recorded with Earl Father Hines and the Kenny Whitson quartet. That album is a worthy detour from the ALL THINGS CONSIDERED road trip playlist if you want to take it.  And you can find other surprises on our playlist at npr.org. It is now 89 songs and still growing.    Yes if he said no I will go anyhow. If he said no...
