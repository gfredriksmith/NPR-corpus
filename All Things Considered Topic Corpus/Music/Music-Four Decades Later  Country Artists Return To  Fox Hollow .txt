 Well Stefan Shepherd has this review of an album that considers preschoolers' concerns while honoring a country music classic.    I love little baby ducks old pickup trucks slow moving trains and rain. I love little country streams sleep without dreams Sunday school in May and hay.  Here Buddy Miller with help from Duane Eddy sings the classic Sneaky Snake.    Boys and girls take warning if you go near the lake. Keep your eyes wide open and look for Sneaky Snake. Now maybe you will not see him. Maybe you will not hear but he will sneak up behind you and drink all of your root beer. And then Sneaky Snake goes dancing wiggling and hissing.  Hall's songwriting has a gentleness about wishing for a million friends or talking to a little baby goat that calms and reassures little kids. But these songs were big hits when first released touching more than just children because even if you are no longer a toddler sometimes it is nice to hear someone singing that he cares about you when things are going badly.    I want you to know I care. I care I do. There is no one like you. When they take you someplace make you sit in a chair I want you to know I care.  The album is called  Tom T. Hall's Songs of Fox Hollow. You can listen to more of the album at NPRmusic.org. Our reviewer Stefan Shepherd blogs about kids' music at Zooglobble.com.    When they are filling your teeth and cutting your hair I want you to know I care. I care I do. There is no one like you.  The voice of Bobby Bare on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
