 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Audie Cornish.  And I am Melissa Block. In All Tech Considered today big tech and the music industry. YouTube is trying to launch a subscription of music streaming service. They have been negotiating with record companies over licensing fees. And YouTube is threatening to block videos by smaller independent music artists if they cannot make a deal. YouTube has long offered a site where fans can find pretty much any artist they want for free. NPR's Laura Sydell reports the stand-off threatens that reputation.  According to YouTube every month a billion people watch 6 billion hours of video. And eight out of 10 of the most popular videos are music.   .  So it is no surprise that Gangam Style was the first video to get 2 billion hits on YouTube. The performer Psy has a relationship with the major label so he will not be affected by the stalled negotiations between YouTube and the independent labels. But other fairly popular bands could vanish from the site.    Out of control but you are playing a role. Do you think you can go to the 18th hole? Or will you flip-flop the day of the championship? Try to go it alone on your own for a bit.  Vampire Weekend has over 3 million views for its song Diane Young. The band is signed to British independent label XL. Stuart Johnston the president of the Canadian Independent Music Association says YouTube has put the independents on notice.  What we are seeing is YouTube dictating terms to the independent music community with the proviso that if those terms are not agreed to or met then the repertoire of that label will be removed from YouTube.  Johnston says YouTube has already negotiated with the three major labels - Universal Sony and Warner. Neither the site nor the labels will reveal the specifics of the deal. But Rich Bengloff with A2IM the American trade group for independent labels says YouTube paid more to the majors than it wants to pay to independents despite the fact that independents account for more than a third of music revenues.  A song by a pop artist such as Justin Bieber should not be valued more than a blues song by an artist by the name of Koko Taylor. They should have the exact same value. Justin Bieber may get paid 10 times more because his music is listened to 10 times more. And that is fair.  Bengloff says that other streaming music services such as Spotify Rhapsody and Rdio have all given independents a better deal than YouTube is offering. But in the world of music YouTube holds an especially powerful position. In the site's early days its relationship with the music industry was often antagonistic. Fans regularly put up videos of their favorite musicians or lip-synched to their songs and the labels accused YouTube of copyright infringement. But the site and the labels worked out agreements that allowed artists and labels to get a percentage of ad revenues. And the industry found that YouTube exposed their artists to new fans.  Today YouTube is the marketing arm of the music business.  James McQuivey is an analyst at Forrester Research. He says there are parallels between this fight and the current dispute between Amazon and the publisher Hachette over the cost of print and e-books. Amazon is delaying delivery of some Hachette titles and it is eliminated pre-orders for others. McQuivey says it signals a shift in the Internet economy which is now centered around the small number of players that get the most eyeballs.  Digital aggregation creates power. And now these companies after years of talking about a big open Internet future are finally starting to show when it comes time to be tough in negotiations they are willing to use their access point as a source of power.  YouTube would not talk to NPR for this report. But McQuivey says it is clear that its planned subscription service will somehow incorporate music video and audio streaming. Since the site is a place where fans are already able to hear and watch videos for free it may be hard to get them to pay. Meanwhile McQuivey says YouTube while profitable has never made the kind of money its owner Google would like to see.  Certainly people who are producing original video content for YouTube are not making the kind of money that they all hoped and I think even YouTube hoped. So case-in-point it is uncertain when you are creating a new kind of digital media experience whether it will be a big hit and then beyond that whether it will generate the kind of revenue you would hope for.  But independent labels say YouTube should not try to hedge its bets on the backs of independent musicians. Ultimately if their videos do not appear on the site it is going to change the nature of YouTube and upset many fans. And that is a power they can exert to get YouTube and the independent labels back to the table. Laura Sydell NPR News San Francisco.
