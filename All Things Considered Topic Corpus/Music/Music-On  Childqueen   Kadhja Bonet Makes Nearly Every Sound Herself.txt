   Oh every morning brings a chance to renew chance to renew. Oh...  This is one of the latest songs from Kadhja Bonet. She is behind almost every sound on her new album called Childqueen. She is not your typical laptop studio solo artist. Her music is alive with strings and flutes vintage keyboards and xylophones. Here's reviewer Tom Moon.  Kadhja Bonet is still relatively unknown just one album out. The streaming services file her music under RB but hearing the way she starts her 2018 effort the tag seems pretty arbitrary.   .  It is a march an old-fashioned military-style caissons-rolling march. And check out where she goes a few songs later.    What is it mean Delphine Delphine Delphine - this letter you wrote to me?  Super-slow deep and vulnerable it is a top-to-bottom overhaul of the torch song with odd bits of synthesizer strangeness scurrying around the edges.    Goodbye.  Right there you sense it. This is an idiosyncratic talent. Kadhja Bonet grew up one of seven kids in a musical family in the Bay Area. She studied violin viola and music theory in high school but afterward rebelled against the formal training. She went to film school did not like it. Returning to music she taught herself production and began writing and recording her songs by herself.    She slept on where the hills are in rolling form far away from the city norm beneath the morning sun.  Bonet has said that the name of her album Childqueen celebrates a state of mind the innocent creativity of childhood in the years before grades and judgment. The album has that light playful quality even with all the orchestration going on. Beneath those layers there is a strong-willed soul pursuing a fiercely individual vision of pop music.   Kadhja Bonet's new album is called Childqueen. Our reviewer is Tom Moon.    You are so great at doing what you do.
