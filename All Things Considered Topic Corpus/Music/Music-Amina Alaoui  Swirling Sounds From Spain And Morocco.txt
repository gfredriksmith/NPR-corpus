 Banning Eyre has this review of her first solo recording.     Amina Alaoui is singing her arrangement of a text dating back to Al-Andalus Moorish Spain six or more centuries ago. This is the one place on Arco Iris where it feels like Alaoui is trying to conjure the actual sound of that mysterious unrecorded era.     Elsewhere backed by an unusual ensemble of mandolin oud and flamenco guitar Alaoui re-imagines a more recent European hybrid the Portuguese fado.     The melancholy mood and loping cadence of fado are present but the ornamentation in Alaoui's vocal reflects her unusual journey through North African and European art music. The same originality shines through when Alaoui veers toward another cultural remnant of Europe's multicultural past flamenco.     Sometimes Alaoui sets rhythm aside in favor of a more freeform exchange between voice and instrument.     On this confident beautiful CD Amina Alaoui retraces the steps of her ancestors exiled from Spain centuries ago. But she charts her own course through this history  The sensation of soul alone is enough for me no name and no land to attach a lineage to.     Alaoui ends with the song Arco Iris which means rainbow. Now the soundscape opens wide with a nod to Cape Verdean rhythm and lyrics that capture the essence of Alaoui' Sun and rain in an embrace she sings sounds of light and color weave in harmony. And so they do.     The album is called Arco Iris by Amina Alaoui. Our reviewer Banning Eyre is senior editor at afropop.org.
