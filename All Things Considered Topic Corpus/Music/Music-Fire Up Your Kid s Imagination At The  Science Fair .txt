 And finally this hour a fun way to tackle the under-representation of women in what are known as the STEM careers - that is science technology engineering and math. According to federal data women hold only 25 percent of those jobs. So how can music help? A new children's album is trying to get girls excited about science. Stefan Shepherd has our review.   As a math-loving parent of a math-loving 'tween girl I am worried that women are significantly underrepresented in science- and engineering-related fields. This new benefit album of kids' music called Science Fair gathers musicians together to tackle that disparity both by raising awareness and firing up the imagination.   That is Moona Luna with H2O. There are a handful of songs here reminiscent of the complex explanatory songs of Schoolhouse Rock! Like Lori Henriques' take on Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.   Most songs here touch on scientific phenomena lightly however and focus more on the process of asking questions and finding inspiration. So instead of singing about the million years it took to create a lump of coal Laura Veirs marvels at how it keeps her warm on a winter's night.   The album features a variety of genres as well as voices old and young. On Rocket Science 10-year-old MC Fireworks shows that imaginative sparks are also part of the scientific process.   Good intentions are a poor substitute for good music but Science Fair does not ignore the music in service of its cause. Sometimes the best way to get kids wondering about how rainbows are created is a big sparkling song they can groove to.   The album is called Science Fair.
