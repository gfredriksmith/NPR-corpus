 And finally yesterday we asked you to contribute to our solar eclipse soundtrack. Here's what you came up with.    When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie that is amore.    Then you flew your Learjet up to Nova Scotia to see the total eclipse of the sun.    As not no sunshine when she is gone and she is always gone too long anytime she goes away.    'ecause I am being followed by a moon shadow moon shadow.    I wear my sunglasses at night.    Blinded by the light cut loose like a goose another runner in the night blinded by the light.    And it burns burns burns the ring of fire the ring of...    Fireball. Fireball.
