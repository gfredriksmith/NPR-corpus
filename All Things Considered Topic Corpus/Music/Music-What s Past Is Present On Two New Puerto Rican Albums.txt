  Two new albums re-imagine classic Puerto Rican sounds for today.   .  Singer Ileana Cabra who is heard here as well as the leaders of the group Miramar are best known for modern salsa and pop. Well now they have both chosen to update older sounds especially the melancholy romantic bolero. Banning Eyre has this review of the two albums.  Ileana Cabra first took the stage as a teenager singing backup for her older half-brothers in the genre-bending Latin Grammy Award-winning dance band Calle 13. But on her ambitious solo debut iLe as she is known transports her spectacular alto voice into a boldly reimagined past.   .  The two boleros we have heard were written by Cabra's late grandmother. These are songs of impossible love and heartbreaking sadness. Cabra's own compositions also find beauty in dark places and not always through the bolero. Rescatarme - Rescue Me - conjures the grandeur of a vintage mambo orchestra - just sensational.   .  The group Miramar goes for an even tighter focus on the past with an album featuring covers by Puerto Rico's greatest and most-beloved bolero composer Sylvia Rexach. The principals here spent over a decade spinning out Nuyorican salsa and other Latin dance groups in the group Bio Ritmo. But in Miramar their voices intertwine in a spare and elegant invocation of heritage.   .  These are trying times for folks with ties to Puerto Rico. The island faces a crippling debt crisis and its diaspora community has endured tragedy on the U.S. mainland. In a time of grief and self-reflection the music of the Ileana Cabra and Miramar offers much needed solace. The pain of the present finds transcendence in enduring expressions from the past.   .
