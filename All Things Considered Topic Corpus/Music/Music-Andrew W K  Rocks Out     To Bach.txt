 Finally this hour to music. Andrew W.K. is a head-banging hard rocker. His songs include Party Hard and Party Til You Puke.  Mr.   Party 'til you puke. Party 'til you puke.  For our series You Must Hear This Andrew W.K. tells us about music that inspires him and it is not what you might think. Mr.  I have played piano since I was 4 years old and I have always loved songs by Johann Sebastian Bach. For me Bach's music is not only as good as music gets it is as good as it gets period. As good as existence reality life and the world.  The fifth Brandenburg Concerto specifically the first movement Allegro has all the joy beauty and exhilarating quality of human life at its best. The energy and exuberance in the melody and the attitude of the rhythm are as powerful to me as any rock and roll song as energizing as any techno dance music as driving and thrilling as any punk or heavy metal. There is even a harpsichord solo which has all the thrills theatrics and drama of a massive electric guitar Shred Fest.  I like to imagine that the feelings Bach was trying to manifest were the equivalent feelings to what a hard rock band is trying to create. It is just pure joy a total rush of energy without ideas concepts or even specific emotions to stand in the way. It is everything and nothing and a mystery and a revelation all at once.  The fifth Brandenburg Concerto reminds me what really matters in music is the sensation of hearing it feeling it and it inspires me to continue to strive to create the strongest sensations I can using the methods and tools I have access to. I hope listening to this piece gives you a strong sensation about being alive and that you take those feelings and do something wonderful.   That was hard rocker Andrew W.K. talking about one of his favorite composers Johann Sebastian Bach. You can hear an excerpt from the Brandenburg Concerto No.5 at nprmusic.org.
