 Our friends at NPR Music are always on the lookout for great new songs.   So they are bringing us some of their favorites starting with a song called Magnolia Blues by Adia Victoria. Here's NPR's Ann Powers.   When Magnolia Blues begins you know it sort of creeps up on you as the blues often does - that bass line that circular chord structure. And in comes Adia's voice...    I followed you into the blue and north into the cold.  ...Which is delicate but also you know full of a kind of courage a kind of awareness of menace. That is all in the mix in her voice.    I gave you all my light and I got naught to show for it.  And what she is singing about is being taken away from the South led away from the South by a love affair - a love affair with a person but maybe also with an idea of what she should be - and then now returning and claiming her heritage claiming her place in a place that you know has rejected people like her has done great violence to Black Americans like herself.    I am going back South down to Carolina. I am going to plant myself under a magnolia.  I love the metaphor of the magnolia tree that she uses in this song because of course it evokes the most horrific history of violence against Black Americans the history of lynching. But she is also claiming her right to sit under that tree her own right to the land to the dirt as she calls it in this song. And it is a welcoming into her journey and I cannot wait to hear the rest of the record and see where she takes us.    Oh it is something in the air tonight something in the air tonight.
