 A moment now to hear what is catching the ear of our kids' music reviewer Stefan Shepherd. It is a new album from Boston musician Alastair Moock. It is dedicated to Moock's daughter Clio who was diagnosed with leukemia. The album is called  Songs For The World's Bravest Kids. Here's Stefan.  I do not know what I would do if my child suffered a life-threatening illness but I am guessing my response would involve music.   That was a definitely a big part of how Boston musician Alastair Moock reacted when one of his twin 5-year-old daughters Clio was diagnosed with leukemia last summer.   He sang traditional songs and made up new ones with Clio the two of them singing together in her hospital room.   Moock's new album  Songs for the World's Bravest Kids is based on his family's experiences with Clio and her fellow patients. Kids fighting illness and their families are its primary audience. But its message of clear-eyed hope and comfort is not just for kids.   You do not need to have a child or be one to appreciate Home When I Hold You his duet with fellow Boston singer Aoife O'Donovan.   Moock crowd-funded the album's production so he could give it away to patients and kids' cancer units. With daughter Clio now in remission as she starts year two of chemotherapy he is also free to take these songs on tour. The songs provide a combination of empathy and humor offering strength to any families facing an uncertain future.   The album is  Songs For The World's Bravest Kids by Alastair Moock and friends.
