DEBRA S.  Mr. Zimmerman your bond will be released. Your GPS monitor will be cut off. You have no further business with the court.  Late last night a jury in Sanford Florida found defendant George Zimmerman not guilty of second degree murder in the death of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin. Even as the defense rejoiced Americans in many cities were dismayed. In Sanford there was immediate outcry from Martin supporters.  Not guilty.  Not guilty.  You are lying.  The NAACP and its president Ben Jealous have asked the Justice Department to file a civil suit of wrongful death.  We are encouraging people to call on the DOJ to continue their investigation and ultimately bring civil rights charges.  Martin's lawyer Ben Crump added his name to a long list of African-Americans killed by racial violence.  Trayvon Martin will forever remain in the annals of history as symbol for the fight for equal justice for all.  For the defense of course a different story. The verdict is a happy relief at least for now. MARK O' Obviously we are ecstatic with the results. George Zimmerman was never guilty of anything except protecting himself in self-defense.
