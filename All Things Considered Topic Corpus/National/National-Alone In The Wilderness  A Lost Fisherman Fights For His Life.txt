 You are out in the wilderness hiking deep through a remote forest and suddenly you realize you are completely lost. You have no cell phone signal no food. You have no idea where you are. That is what happened to Mike Vilhauer earlier this month. He was on a fishing trip in the Mokelumne Wilderness 70 miles east of Sacramento California when what started as a weekend getaway turned into a fight for his life.  I was fishing on this lake. It was a small lake and I was in a kayak. I am the only one there. It was like 45 in the morning because I would been there all day fishing and without success. And then I thought you know what I am going to hurry up and go get some bait and come right back. And it ended up being five days later that I actually got to see somebody.  And what were you looking for out in the woods?  Grasshoppers actually. After everything else failed get the local insects and then the vast majority of times we would catch fish. And so I thought you know what I am going to go and see if I can find some. And went up a ridge and was expecting to see the lake - and no lake. I actually had a little topographical map just around the lake. And by the time I realized I was lost I was actually off my map.  Do you at some point start to feel panic creeping in?  I was actually more irritated with myself. It was getting windy and a storm front was coming in. And so I was looking for somewhere to get out of the wind. And then I found a big pine tree and just started pulling in needles. And then I saw some willow trees and so I started cutting branches and then basically just tried to cover up. I was wet from going in and out of streams so I stayed awake all night as I did for the next four nights.  Mike what were you surviving on? Did you have any food with you? Any water? What did you do?  I had no food for five days. And then there is some streams running through these canyons that I was crossing to go up to the ridges. And so I would always go back down to the streams. I just kept drinking whenever I could find some water.  Rescue crews were out searching for you. And I know there was a time when a helicopter flew basically right overhead and they did not spot you. But another day goes by. And by day five you are still out there. Did you ever think to yourself - I am not going to get out of here?  Saturday was my last attempt at trying to crest a mountain to look on the other side and I did not think the ridge was that high. And unfortunately I would get up to that ridge and there would be another ridge and then there would be another ridge and another ridge. And then I actually just laid down and I - for a few minutes said you know what I am done. I cannot do this anymore. I am exhausted. I have no strength. And then about five - ten minutes and then I said no I am not doing that here. I am going back to that damn water. And I am going to stay there for as long as it takes until they find me.  You decide that you are going to write a giant message with cypress needles. Where did you do it? Was there a meadow or something where that was going to stand out to anyone who was looking for you from above?  I was at the edge of a cliff and the gravel and the rock was very light - like a light tan. And there was one tree in the middle and it was a cypress tree. I started doing little haircutting on the cypress tree and then sticking branches into the ground on the side of this ridge with help - about 8-feet-tall letters.  And this is what got you rescued?  Ultimately they saw the help sign yeah. They came by and they - I was thinking they were going over the ridge but they came back around. They had to see me. I mean I am getting up and waving my little shirt and yelling and screaming for you know 30 - 40 seconds before I was exhausted. And then they would come back around again. They were circling for the ground team.  And what was that like for you when you saw the first person come out of the woods?  It was actually a dog. Micah was the tracking dog and right then behind her was that dog handler. And then I could look up and I could see the other ones coming down. They were all in orange. And so that was one hell of a relief.  Mike Vilhauer - stranded in the Northern California wilderness for five days. He is back home in Sacramento still recovering but getting back to normal. According to the Alpine County Sherriff's Department eight counties had search and rescue teams out looking for him. Next month he will meet with members of those search crews including the El Dorado County search and rescue team which spotted his help message written in   cypress needles to thank them and maybe to promise that they will never have to do it again.
