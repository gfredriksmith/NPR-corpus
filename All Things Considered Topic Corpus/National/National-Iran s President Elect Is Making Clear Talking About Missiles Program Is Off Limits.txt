 The U.S. envoy on Iran is getting ready for another round of indirect talks aimed at reviving the 2015 nuclear deal but a newly elected president of Iran does not want to take on other issues the Americans are hoping to discuss. NPR's Michele Kelemen reports.  Hardliner Ebrahim Raisi will be sworn in as Iran's president in August and he is already making clear that some topics are off limits like the country's missile program. But the Biden administration wants to talk about missiles and get a better nuclear deal with Iran. The first step is getting back into the one the Trump administration left. That job falls to U.S. envoy Robert Malley.  I do not think that this window is going to be open forever. At some point we will have to conclude that this is not succeeding but we are not there yet. We still think that it is possible. We still think that it is certainly in our interests. We think it is in Iran's interest too. But they will have to make that decision for themselves.  In an interview to air on Friday's Morning Edition Malley says the negotiations in Vienna have been tough. Iran wants more financial relief than the U.S. is willing to offer and the U.S. wants to in Malley's words rewind the tape on work Iran has done since the Trump administration left the deal like building its supply of nuclear fuel.  Get back to where we were in 2016 with a cap on the levels of enrichment with a cap on what centrifuges they could use to enrich with a cap on the amount of enriched uranium they could have and with the IEA the nuclear inspectors being able to monitor everything they are doing which is not occurring today.  Iran refuses to meet U.S. diplomats so Malley passes messages through European diplomats. He is also raising the cases of detained Americans though Biden administration officials insist that this is separate from the nuclear diplomacy. Michele Kelemen NPR News Washington.
