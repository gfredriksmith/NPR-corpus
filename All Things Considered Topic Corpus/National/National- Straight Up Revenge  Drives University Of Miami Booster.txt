 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Michele Norris.  Emmert spoke on ESPN Radio this morning.  So we were well aware of it and were not surprised by the sensational media coverage 'ecause it is being developed as we speak. So we have been on top of it for a while gathering information and collecting data. And we will just continue that process and let it work its course.  And NPR's Tom Goldman is with us for more on this story and the broader questions it raises about the NCAA. Hi Tom.  Hi Robert.  Mark Emmert is talking about collecting data letting the process run its course. This sounds like what the NCAA says every time it investigates any university. Is this investigation any different?   They allegedly went on for about eight years up until last year. They involved over 70 football players and other athletes including a number of current members of the football team. And Shapiro says a half-dozen coaches in football and men's basketball knew about it too.  Yeah this developing scandal at the University of Miami touches not just players but members of the school's athletic department the administration. How were they allegedly involved?  And finally Robert Schapiro tells the story of almost getting into a fistfight with Miami's compliance director at a football game in 2007. After that incident which was corroborated by others the compliance director investigated Shapiro discovered what Shapiro was doing but no one at the university took any action.  Now there is talk at the NCAA of how colleges should be punished when scandals like these are uncovered. And people use the term the death penalty. What would that be and is it actually possible?  Now as you mentioned university presidents are on record saying they are fed up with rule breaking punishment needs to be strictly enforced. We will see what happens.  Thank you Tom.  You are welcome.  That is NPR's sports correspondent Tom Goldman.
