 Today in Chattanooga Tenn. a somber moment.   Late this afternoon several churches and chapels rang their bells.   They chimed five times - one for each of the military service members who died in the shootings one week ago.  Sergeant Carson Holmquist Petty Officer Randall Smith Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Sullivan Lance Corporal Squire Wells Staff Sergeant David Wyatt.  Federal authorities still do not have a clear picture of why Muhammad Abdulazeez went to the two military facilities and opened fire targeting the service members. Agents are looking into his mental health and examining if he had ties to any radical organization.  The first of the funerals is tomorrow in Hixson Tenn. Family and friends will gather to remember Marine Staff Sergeant David Wyatt. After the funeral there'ill be a procession to the Chattanooga National Cemetery where he will be buried with full military honors.
