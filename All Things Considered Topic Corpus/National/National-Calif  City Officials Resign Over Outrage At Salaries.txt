 From member station KPCC Frank Stoltze reports.  Angry residents waited until the Bell city council finished a marathon closed-door meeting at midnight to hear the news.   Number one the chief administrative officer Mr. Robert Rizzo has resigned effective August 30th 2010.   Recall recall recall recall.   Ali Saleh is with the Bell Association to Stop the Abuse.  There is no faith in them anymore for them to stay any longer.  Bell sits about 10 miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. Its 40000 residents are 90 percent Latino. More than half are foreign born. Like most municipalities Bell has laid off workers as it struggles with declining tax revenues. Still Mayor Oscar Hernandez defended city salaries to local television station KTLA.   How do you justify 800000 in a city this small and this poor?  The only thing I say - this community they are receiving a good service.  That has not convinced State Attorney General Jerry Brown who is opened an investigation into Bell's pay practices. Councilman Lorenzo Velez receives a fraction of his colleagues' salary. He said he only became aware of the big salaries recently. And that the scandal sends a message.  It is important for everybody everywhere wherever you are to stay aware of what is going on in your municipality and your city hall.  For NPR News I am Frank Stoltze in Los Angeles.
