 In Miami in the large vocal Haitian community there nearly everyone has an opinion about the candidacy of Wyclef Jean.  I am Edouard Duval-Carrie. I am an artist. My studio is in Little Haiti right now. I know he can sing. Governing a country with so many problems? I wonder.  My name is Stek Pierre. I think he is going to bring change.  My name is Mark Frusion. All the young people either abroad or in Haiti I think they will love him.  Lee Andre Unisek with the salon. And Wyclef grew up in an American country so I think that is why I pray for him to be the president in Haiti.  Some voices today from the streets of Little Haiti in Miami.
