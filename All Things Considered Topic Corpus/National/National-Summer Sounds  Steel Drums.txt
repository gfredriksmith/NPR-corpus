  summer sounds.    It is summertime.  My name is Lila Sheon and I am 14-year-old girl living in a Washington D.C. neighborhood called Petworth. My community is very diverse and it is filled with many immigrants from several islands especially Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago. When I think of what sound signals summer for me my mind immediately jumps to the Pan Jammers a 20-or-so piece steel drum band that practices at night in the alley not too far from my house.   Our house is filled with their cheerful island beat and we cannot help but stop everything we are doing and listen.   I am constantly amazed at how nothing can bring people together quite like music and nothing gives our community more pride than the Pan Jammers.   Summer would not be the same without them.   An urban sound transplanted from the islands from our listener Lila Sheon for our series Summer Sounds.
