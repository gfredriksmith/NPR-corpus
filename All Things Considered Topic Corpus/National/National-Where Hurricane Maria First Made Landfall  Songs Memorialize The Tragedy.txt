 A year ago today Hurricane Maria cut a destructive path across Puerto Rico flattening the power grid destroying tens of thousands of homes and ultimately causing an estimated 3000 deaths. The first town hit the place where Maria made landfall was Yabucoa. And that is where NPR's Adrian Florido was this morning.  Margarita Torres Rivera lives in Yabucoa in a little house overlooking the Atlantic. She watched the storm come in and remembers that Wednesday morning a year ago as if it were yesterday.  .  It was like a fury she says. We all just resigned ourselves to God's will and prayed that he would have compassion for our island. She says the recovery over the last year has been difficult because of mistreatment from the federal government and from President Trump.  .  Today she says she decided not to think about the troubles of the last year but to try to look ahead. So this morning she woke up before sunrise and took a little walk to a point overlooking the ocean. Alberto Carrion a well-known composer had come to sing a song with the choir from the University of Puerto Rico in Cayey.  . This song represents like a new beginning. Like it is called Amanecer Borincano which is a Borinquen sunrise.  Borinquen is a precolonial name for Puerto Rico.  This is the exact place where the hurricane Maria came into the island last year.  Amarilis Pagan-Vila is the choir's conductor.  So we wanted to commemorate that day singing this song that speaks about waking up again with a new spirit. And we wanted to do that song exactly at the time 15 when Hurricane Maria came into the island.  .  The performance was carried by many local TV and radio stations a brief respite for many Puerto Ricans still struggling to recover from last year's tragedy.
