 Both President Obama and Mitt Romney paused their campaigning today after hearing about the shooting and their campaigns asked for TV ads to be pulled in Colorado.  Romney and President Obama used scheduled appearances to talk about the tragedy and extend condolences. In Florida Mr. Obama said he like many parents thought of his own daughters upon hearing the news.  Michelle and I will be fortunate enough to hug our girls a little tighter tonight and I am sure you will do the same with your children. But for those parents who may not be so lucky we have to embrace them and let them know we will be there for them as a nation.  And in New Hampshire Mitt Romney said today is a day for prayer and compassion not a day for politics.  I stand before you today not as a man running for office but as a father and grandfather a husband an American. This is a time for each of us to look into our hearts and remember how much we love one another and how much we love and how much we care for our great country.  Mitt Romney speaking in New Hampshire. Across the country by the president's order American flags are flying at half-staff. President Obama said it is a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of violence.
