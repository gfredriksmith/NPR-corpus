 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Police in Milwaukee say they have finally caught up with a serial killer who terrorized the city for more than two decades. They say they have linked a 49-year-old man to the murders of at least nine women. He was arrested last weekend. As Erin Toner of member station WUWM reports the case has some in Milwaukee asking why it is taken so long.  It is October 1986 and Milwaukee police find two prostitutes strangled to death just one day apart. Six years later there is another murder and prostitutes keep getting killed here over the next two decades. But it was not until this past May that police here confirmed suspicions that a serial killer's been on the loose. The man's name kept popping up in crime reports so police went to his home got a DNA sample from his toothbrush and arrested him last weekend at a nearby hotel. Police Chief Ed Flynn says they have finally found their man. Mr.  We are announcing today the culmination of the labors of many people in many agencies with today with the arrest of a person we have linked to the homicides of nine women over a 21-year period.  Walter E. Ellis has been charged in the murders of seven women so far. And that number could grow as investigators review the cases of another 20 strangled prostitutes. So why did it take so long to find a suspect? Sitting in a conference room off his downtown office Chief Flynn says prostitute homicides are just hard to solve because the crimes take place out of public view. Flynn says his detectives recently began reviewing the prostitutes' murders. Mr.  We looked at every sexual assault investigation over the course of 23 years. There were 16000 of them. They looked at 6000 prostitution-related arrests over that period of time. They submitted hundreds of names for DNA profiles for people that were in the system.  The police chief says while the cases might have gone cold they were never put on the back burner as some critics are charging. LaVerne McCoy retired from the Milwaukee Police Department in January. When she was a beat cop she says prostitute murders were not a high priority. Ms.  The fact that these were hookers I think that these were disposable portion of society that who gives a crap about them?  One of the women was Sheila Farrior a 37-year-old prostitute killed in 1995. Her father Sandy Farrior lives in a small house less than a mile from where his daughter's body was found. He is still unhappy with the police investigation. Mr.  They do not have a very good track record. They lose things. They make mistakes.  While it appears the police did not lose anything they say they could have arrested Ellis sooner if his DNA was on file. A sample was taken in 2001 when he was in prison for a different felony but nobody can find it. And officials say that may have cost at least one woman her life. Stan Stojkovic teaches criminal justice at the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee and he is not surprised by the missing DNA.  If you look at these kinds of murders and cases that involve multiple victims over multiple years it is not unusual to find lack of coordination among law enforcement agencies loss of evidence poor investigative techniques poor evidence collection.  While missteps may be common in these kinds of cases one local man charges he was the victim of bad police work. Chaunte Ott spent 13 years in prison and is suing Milwaukee for wrongful conviction. Ott was released in January after DNA testing connected the victim to a different man a man police now say is alleged serial killer Walter Ellis. For NPR News I am Erin Toner in Milwaukee.
