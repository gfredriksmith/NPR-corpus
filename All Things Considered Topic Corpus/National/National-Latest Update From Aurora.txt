 And if you are just joining us you are listening to WEEKENDS on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Guy Raz. Here's what we know about yesterday's mass shooting in Aurora Colorado at this hour. Twelve people are dead and 58 others injured with some in critical condition in hospitals in the area. Earlier today President Obama had this to say about the tragedy.  Even as we come to learn how this happened and who is responsible we may never understand what leads anyone to terrorize their fellow human beings. Such evil is senseless beyond reason.  Survivors describe scenes of chaos and confusion inside that movie theater. Patricia Legaretta is one of them. She spoke to CNN.  I just ran out. I did not turn around. I did not look behind me. I just got out. And then there was a moment when my daughter tripped and I just pulled her up and I was just dragging her and I was just thinking we just got to get out.  The suspect 24-year-old James Holmes is in custody. Little is known about him. Investigators are hoping to gather evidence inside his apartment.  It is booby-trapped dozens of explosives and a trip wire to detonate them. Earlier today a bomb squad carried out a controlled detonation on one of those devices.  Fire in the hole.   Authorities are working to preserve the contents of that apartment. Meanwhile makeshift memorials have gone up throughout the city of Aurora. Stay with NPR.
