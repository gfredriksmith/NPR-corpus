 People who live in the southwest of the U.S. are used to the heat but...  Whew. It has been sizzling hot these last few days.  That is meteorologist Iris Hermosillo. Even she cannot believe the temperatures in Phoenix Ariz. the last few days. She is with KNXV-TV.  The high today was about 110 degrees a bit of a relief compared to yesterday's 115 or Sunday's 118.  Your skin just feels like it is burning. It is as if you opened up that oven door and that first hot air - blast of hot air hits your face. That is kind of what it feels like when you step outside when it is 115-plus or 110-plus.  The heat wave stretches across most of the Southwestern U.S. At least four people have died and the temperatures are fueling several wildfires.  In Phoenix an excessive heat warning is in place through Thursday night. Iris Hermosillo says that limits any outside activities.  Indoors indoors indoors - that is the place to be. And then just stressing to stay hydrated. Do not wait until you are thirsty. Make sure that you know the signs of heat stroke.  Those include nausea skin that is hot to the touch and not sweating. Hermosillo says watch out for pets too. And remember it is temporary.  We can endure three months of this for the you know rest of the year that is pretty picture-perfect.  Stay safe out there.
