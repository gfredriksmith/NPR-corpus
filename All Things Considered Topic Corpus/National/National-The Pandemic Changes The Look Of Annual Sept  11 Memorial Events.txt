 Today for the 19th time New Yorkers remembered the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks.   A remembrance for victims of a catastrophe that shaped the last generation unfolding amid the pandemic that may well define the next.  It is actually more difficult than any of the other years because you know the social distancing and not being able to give each other comfort and hugs.  That is Jaye Markwell who lives in Connecticut. She came to the city after the attack to volunteer for the Salvation Army.

Aamoth Jr.  Edelmiro Abad.  A separate group the Tunnel to Towers Foundation took issue with the restrictions and hosted a separate event with names read live just one block away.   The horrific loss of life requires that we read these names out loud in person on this day every year.   Kenny Camey was just 3 years old on the day of the attacks. He moved to New York City from Texas for college and this was his first time at the remembrance.  One thing that is nice to see is a sense of community that especially in New York City we can all come together for one thing. That is important to all of us.  He would been standing listening for almost three hours and planned to stay. He said it was not just names being read it was a story being told.
