 Pierogi and polka on a hot summer day - it is the next stop on our tour of summer festivals.   I am Michael Puente in Whiting Ind. right outside Chicago at Pierogi Fest. But what is a pierogi? Let us go find out.   What is your name?  Jim Oaks .  How would you describe a pierogi?  It is a Polish dumpling and they are filled with either different meats cheeses. A lot of them have fruits. You have your desert ones which are blueberry strawberry.  Which is the most popular one?  Potato cheddar - there is nothing better.  How did Pierogi Fest become this huge event?  It started off as just four small vendors and it caught on because of Whiting being such a melting pot. And it just blew up.  My maiden name is Teresa Sentkofski . In English it is Teresa Sentkowski .  So what makes this Pierogi Fest so special?  I think a lot of it is the love of the people from the area. Most of us that grew up here are Eastern European. We are either Polish or Slovak or Hungarian. And this weekend we all come home. It brings joy to my heart to see people celebrating my heritage.  My name is Maya Perez .  Are you Polish?  No Mexican.  How did you become an expert on making pierogi?  My brother-in-law bought the restaurant being already a Polish restaurant and he learned their recipes.  I am finding out most of the people who are cooking the pierogis are not really polish.  Yes that is true .  Next in line.  There is at least 50 people waiting in line at this one pierogi stand.  Anything else?  We have potato cheddar.  First name...  We have sauerkraut. We have meat. We have sweet cheese or we have mushroom.  Can I try some...  At Pierogi Fest in Whiting Ind.
