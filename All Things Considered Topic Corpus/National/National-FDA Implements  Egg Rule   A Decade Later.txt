 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. As the Food and Drug Administration investigates the salmonella outbreak that prompted the massive egg recall it is also implementing a new egg inspection program. The program is new this summer but it was first proposed more than a decade ago. NPR's Peter Overby reports on what took so long.  It was a Saturday in December 1999 when President Bill Clinton proposed the Egg Rule. He told a radio audience that salmonella contamination in eggs was a health risk to be taken seriously.   That is why today I am taking new action on food safety to cut in half over the next five years the number of salmonella cases attributed to eggs. And our goal is to eliminate these cases entirely by 2010.  Obviously that target date has slipped. But egg producers say that was not their fault. Mr.  No we never tried to delay or object to the rule itself.  Howard Magwire is vice president of government relations for United Egg Producers a cooperative association that includes among many others the two Iowa companies where tainted eggs originated and started this summer's panic. Magwire describes a regulatory process that moved only in fits and starts and left egg producers waiting for the FDA to act. At the Center for Science in the Public Interest food safety director Caroline Smith DeWaal largely agrees. Ms.  The agency just proceeded very very slowly in moving the regulation forward.  She says one big roadblock after 2000 was the Bush administration' It did not want to expand the FDA's responsibility this way. And when the proposed Egg Rule did move forward in 2004 and again in 2008 the United Egg Producers did not object to the rule itself as Magwire says but they did question the FDA's ability to do the inspections. Magwire noted that some states already had voluntary programs and the number of salmonella cases was dropping nationwide. Magwire also got to make his case to the White House Office of Management and Budget which Caroline Smith DeWaal notes was basically anti-regulation during the Bush administration. Ms.  The egg industry clearly knew they had a friendly audience at OMB for delaying or changing aspects of the regulation.  In letters written to regulators at that time Magwire pointed out that the FDA already had new burdens of inspecting imported food and its budget was being squeezed. He asked quote Does FDA really want to add more than 4000 individual inspections of farms to its existing workload? Magwire insists his people have no special problem with the FDA. Mr.  That is not been a disagreement between the industry and FDA. It is just been us urging that is a good way to implement it.  And the way he is talking about is for state inspectors or the U.S. Department of Agriculture to do safety inspections for the FDA. Mr.  We said hey these folks are already on our - at our packing plants four times a year which where many of our farms are located. Since they are going there anyway come to an understanding with them where they can perform the inspections.  But the state inspection programs are voluntary. And the USDA inspectors are in the Agricultural Marketing Service which does not have a culture of safety enforcement. So DeWaal is skeptical. Ms.  I mean clearly the voluntary programs have not been sufficient. And also the AMS is a quality agency not a safety agency.   The Egg Rule did not go forward until the Obama administration took office last year. And it did not take effect until July 9th. The FDA recall this month reaches back to cover eggs since early April. Peter Overby NPR News Washington.
