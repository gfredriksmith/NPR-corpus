 While we are learning more about the alleged shooter details about the victims have been scarce. One of the 12 people killed in the shooting has been identified as Jessica Ghawi. She was a blogger and aspiring sports broadcaster working at a radio station in Denver. On her Twitter feed last night she described herself as a red-headed Texan spitfire and said she was going to see the Batman movie.  Just last month Jessica Ghawi barely escaped another mass shooting. She was at a mall in Toronto just before a shooter opened fire killing one person and injuring seven others. Her brother Jordan spoke with TV station KUSA in Denver about his sister.  My sister's a fighter and she had great intuition. She was actually in Toronto last month at the mall shooting and left the food court three minutes prior because she had a bad feeling. So she is dodged some events and she is listened to her heart but I want people to remember that heart and remember the good things she is done remember that smile and what her possibilities what her perspective what she could have done in the future.  That was Jordan Ghawi remembering his sister Jessica one of the 12 people killed early this morning in Aurora Colorado.
