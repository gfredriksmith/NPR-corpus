 Two media giants are joining forces.  Before we could buy almost anything with our smartphones there was the Home Shopping Network and QVC.   I am telling you this hairspray is amazing. Now do you love my Plump 'N Thick?  I - I keep like 8 cans at a time...  Oh girl let me give you a can of spray.  QVC and the Home Shopping Network or HSN launched in the mid-'80s. Since then the two have grown into TV behemoths by marketing things to us we never knew we needed.  There are legions of people who sit at home on their couches watch the sales pitches on these networks and buy all kinds of things from designer gowns to crazy gadgets to kitchenware.  Brian Steinberg is TV editor at Variety. He says the deal worth over 2 billion unites two rivals.  Like having Coke and Pepsi merge. And these two networks at one time were really quite something. They kind of created a business out of nowhere the business of selling things direct to consumers through a TV network.  The plan is for HSN and QVC to retain their unique brands.  And if you are looking to honor their commitment HSN has some lovely crystal glasses on offer.   I mean this is crystal. This is not just your everyday glasses that you see you know...  Operators are standing by.
