 Now to a modern twist on an old tale of an anthropomorphic egg.  We are talking of course about Humpty Dumpty. You know the one who sat on a wall and had a great fall. And then there was the mess with all the king's horses and all the king's men. And Robert you know the rest. They could not put Humpty together again.  But Mr. Dumpty may have a happier ending at the Enchanted Forest theme park in Salem Oregon. This real-life nursery rhyme starts out in a similar way.  On Saturday two men - they climbed up a wall trying to reach a Humpty statue sitting proud and tall. But they pulled him too hard and their efforts were marred.  And that is where the fun part of our story ceases.  He fell down and just smashed pieces.  That is Roger Tofte. The 84-year-old is the owner of the Enchanted Forest and the artist who created that Humpty Dumpty statue. But unlike all the king's horses and all the king's men Tofte says he will put Humpty together again.  We are trying to save as many pieces as we can so we can kind of go from that again. So we will try and make it just about the same as it was.  The statue about 5 feet wide and 6 feet tall had been at the Enchanted Forest since it first opened back in 1971. Roger Tofte says he hopes to build another Humpty and have it back on the wall in a month or so.  In the meantime we are updating the classic rhyme to include a more optimistic outcome - Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall. There is no need for your horses no need for your men. This guy Roger can put him together again.
