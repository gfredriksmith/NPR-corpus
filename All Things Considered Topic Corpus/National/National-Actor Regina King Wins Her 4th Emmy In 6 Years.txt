 Regina King is on a roll.   The Emmy goes to Regina King Watchmen.  Woo Regina King.  The Emmy goes to Regina King American Crime.  Regina King American Crime.  Last night King won an Emmy Award for her performance as a detective in the HBO series Watchmen. That makes four Emmys in just six years.  And all four awards were for different roles. King won in 2018 for the Netflix series Seven Seconds where she played the mother of a Black teenage boy who was hit by a car by a white policeman. And she won twice for the series American Crime. One season she was a corporate exact whose son is accused of rape in another a devout Muslim whose brother is caught up in a murder investigation.   I am so proud of this show so proud to be a part of this show to have the opportunity to tell stories that provoke conversation necessary conversation.  And oh yeah Sacha she also won an Oscar last year too.  Oh just that. All those roles touch on the relationship between Black Americans and the criminal justice system. Last year NPR's Sam Sanders asked her if she actively seeks out such roles.   I do not feel like I am actively looking for these stories. But I will say that if the story moves me then - it moves me and feels like it is rooted in truth even if it is a comedy...  Yeah.  ...Then I am attracted to it.  Yeah.  I will say because I have been on this earth for 48 years...  Yeah.  ...And so much of that is part of my experience being Black in America...  Yeah.  ...Subconsciously and consciously...  Yeah.  ...I cannot help but be attracted to it.  You are drawn to it.  I cannot help it.  That is Regina King. She won her fourth Emmy last night tying the record for acting Emmys to a Black performer.
