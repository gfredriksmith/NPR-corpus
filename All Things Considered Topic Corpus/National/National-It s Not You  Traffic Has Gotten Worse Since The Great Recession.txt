 And it is not you. The traffic is getting worse.  Yeah up 5 percent since 2007 before the great recession. Tim Lomax is a research engineer at Texas AM. He co-authored a new report about traffic delays in American cities.  What we are looking at is the effect of the economic recession coming to an end - prosperity more jobs more people - and the transportation network has not expanded to keep up with that.  And it is not just commuters in cities like New York and San Francisco. Washington with about 650000 people tops the list.  For the average D.C. auto-commuter they are wasting 82 hours of extra travel time so that is like two weeks of vacation.  And with those two weeks go some of the money that you could have been spending on mai tais on the beach.  They are also wasting 35 gallons of fuel. If you put a price tag on that you wind up with a congestion tax if you will of 1830.  Pretty rough for drivers around D.C. But Ari they are not the worst.  No. The worst stretch of highway is right where you would expect. It can take an hour and a half to go 26 miles on the 101 in Los Angeles.
