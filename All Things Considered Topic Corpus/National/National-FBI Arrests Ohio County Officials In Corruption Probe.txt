 From WCPN in Cleveland Mhari Saito reports.  Since then the investigation has touched nearly 70 public officials business people and civil servants though just over half of those have been formally charged. Cuyahoga County Commissioner Tim Hagan says he believes today's arrests are the grand finale.  Two County Common Pleas Court judges were also arrested today on charges that they helped Dimora and Russo with favors in their courtrooms. After pleading not guilty Dimora defended his actions to a crowd of reporters on the courthouse steps.  We have to do things sometimes to help people and that is all we ever do. That is what I do is help people. I have done nothing any different than any other public official.  For NPR News I am Mhari Saito in Cleveland.
