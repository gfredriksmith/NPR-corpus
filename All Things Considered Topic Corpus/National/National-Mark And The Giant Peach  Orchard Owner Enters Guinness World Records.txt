 Peach season is almost over but this year it is going out with a bang for Mark Angermayer of Tubby Fruits Peach Orchard just outside Kansas City.  Last week he climbed up a tree to pick a few extra pounds of Lady Nancy peaches for a customer and he noticed...  There was about a dozen of them that were just huge. They were almost cantaloupe sized.  So Angermayer decided to find out if one of these peaches was not just big but world record big.  The current official record right now is 725 grams and our peach came in at 763 grams.  That is more than a pound and a half.  But you cannot just say it is so and get the world's heaviest peach title.  Guinness World Records requires a really precise scale so that was kind of hard to find and then I had to find two horticultural experts to you know certify that the peach had not been tampered with that it did not have any cracks in the skin.  It also had to be eaten after careful measurements in the lab. And Angermayer says it was not bland or mushy like some oversized peaches.  This one was juicy and it was sweet. You know it was really good.  As evidence Angermayer took video of the whole process from measuring to eating. He has now submitted his application to Guinness World Records. The official review could take 12 weeks.  In the meantime there are peaches to sell.  I had regular customer just pull in now.  But before we let Angermayer go we had to ask has he gotten any references to James and the Giant Peach?   Yeah it would be really fitting if my name was James but it is just not. It is just something simple like Mark.  Well Mark and the Giant Peach has a nice ring to it.
