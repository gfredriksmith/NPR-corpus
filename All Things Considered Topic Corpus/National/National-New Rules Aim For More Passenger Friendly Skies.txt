 Well new airline regulations take effect today and most travelers will agree they are good. As NPR's Brian Naylor reports passengers who get involuntarily bumped will be entitled to more compensation and airlines face stiffer penalties for long tarmac delays on international flights.  Kate Hanni president of FlyersRights.org which pushed for the new regulations gives the government credit for implementing them.  This Department of Transportation I really have to hand it to them. In the first time in history this DOT has taken on airline passenger issues and really is doing a very good job.  The airline industry says it is competitive pressures in the marketplace that are making airlines more passenger-friendly rather than federal rules. Steve Lott is a vice president of the Air Transport Association.  The airline industry is a tremendously competitive industry and customer service is an important way for airlines to differentiate themselves from the competition. So it is this competitive nature of the industry and this customer choice that drives a lot of the customer service improvements. It is not necessarily regulations.  Consumer groups say even more steps are needed to protect airline passengers. For one thing Brandon Macsata of the Association for Airline Passenger Rights says airlines should be required to refund baggage fees for delayed luggage not just lost bags.  Let us say your bag shows up four days late. They do not have to refund you for it. If you purchase something which in this case you are purchasing your bag to be taken from point A to point B and it shows up not with you on your person then we simply feel that these fees should be refunded.
