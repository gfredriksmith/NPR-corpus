 Yesterday we invited listeners to submit their stories and photos about a river in northern New Jersey the Passaic or as listener Bill Walker who was born in the city of Paterson New Jersey corrects us Passaic.  Passaic two syllables. The only people who use the three-syllable pronunciation are New York announcers who never bother to learn the correct way to say this word.  Hey I am a native daughter of Brooklyn. Who is he calling a New York announcer?   Either way Robert we were planning to tell the story of this remarkable waterway later this fall. This is the river that Alexander Hamilton envisioned as the key to young America's economic success. And as a result it was used and abused for centuries. So if you have any recollections or pictures of the Passaic or Passaic River in northern New Jersey please send them to river at npr.org.
