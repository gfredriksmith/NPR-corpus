 Think about how many sounds you hear in a given day. Some of them are easy to recognize - an alarm ringing in the morning cars honking in traffic. But we hear plenty of other sounds that are less noticeable. The podcast The World According to Sound brings us one of them now. Here's producer Sam Harnett.   This is a bridge - the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. It was recorded by musician Jodi Rose. She puts contact microphones right on the cables and support towers of bridges and this is what they record.   It is the sound of the bridge moving and vibrating as the wind blows through and cars rush by.   Rose is obsessed with the sounds bridges make. She records them all over the world. Each one has its own song. SOUNDBITE OF BRIDGE   The World According to Sound is made by Sam Harnett and Chris Hoff. You can hear more at theworldaccordingtosound.org.
