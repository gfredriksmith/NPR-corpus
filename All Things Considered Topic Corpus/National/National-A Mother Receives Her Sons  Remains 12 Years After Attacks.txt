 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Audie Cornish.  And I am Robert Siegel. For relatives of the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks the calls are still coming calls from the New York City Medical Examiner's Office telling families about newly identified remains. Sarah Gonzalez of New Jersey Public Radio reports that the calls take people right back to that day in 2001.  Just a week ago Sandra Grazioso says her family got one of those calls. Two more body parts had been identified.  An upper arm something to do with the upper arm and shoulder and a tooth a molar.  The 78-year-old lost both of her sons in the 911 attacks Tim and John.  I brought a picture.  Tim was 42 the more sensitive brother. He commuted to the World Trade Center from Florida where he lived with his wife and 12-year-old twin daughters. John was considered the funnier brother. He was 41 and married with three children in New Jersey. Tim worked on the 104th floor of the Trade Center and John worked on the 105th floor. For more than a decade the families have been receiving the remains of the two brothers. The body parts the family just got the call about were found years ago.  In 2001 and 2006 but they just ID'd them now that is why. It never gets easier. It never does. And somebody said cannot they just tell you once a year? But no. They call you - they called my daughter-in-law. They called her every time.  Ellen Borakove with the New York City Medical Examiner's Office says there are still more than 8000 individual body parts that have yet to be identified from the September 11 attacks. One victim can be linked to hundreds of remains. Each piece is tested for DNA and delivered to funeral homes for families to collect. The medical examiner's office has identified close to 14000 individual body parts belonging to 1634 people since the attacks. More than 1000 people who went missing on 911 have not yet had any remains linked to them. One more of John Grazioso as body parts were identified last year. His mom says they had his grave in New Jersey dug up.  They have all opened up cracked open the casket and the new body parts in there and then put it back in the ground.  She says it reopens the wounds every time. The medical examiner's office says families can choose to not get calls when body parts are identified. Any unclaimed remains will go into the 911 memorial in New York City. And generations later if relatives want to find out about the remains of loved ones on September 11 they will still have that option. For NPR News I am Sarah Gonzalez in New York.
