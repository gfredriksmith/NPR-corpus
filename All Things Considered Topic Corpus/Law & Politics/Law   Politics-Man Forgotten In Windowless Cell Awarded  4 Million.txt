 Four point one million dollars that is how much money is coming to Daniel Chong. It is part of a settlement with the Drug Enforcement Administration which put him through quite an ordeal last year in San Diego. As the college student told us in an interview last year he was taken into custody after a drug raid questioned told he was not a suspect but handcuffed.  They placed me into the holding cell. I asked them why am I still being put in the holding cell. They said do not worry you are going to be released this is just policy. We are going to come get you in a minute and they closed that cell door.  Four days later he was discovered in that windowless cell forgotten. Chong spoke about what happened in those four days saying I did not stay sane.  Eventually I - I was hallucinating by the second or third night. I even at one point begged them to urinate through the crack of the door just for me to drink.  Daniel Chong had gone without food water or personal contact. He lost 15 pounds in those four days and was hospitalized for dehydration and kidney failure. Now not only has he won more than 4 million his lawyer says the DEA has placed surveillance cameras in each cell in its San Diego facility to prevent similar nightmares.   This is NPR.
