 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Now to this election season's most costly House primary. For more than a century a Democrat has represented the farm towns and suburbs of west Tennessee. Over the last two decades it is been John Tanner a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat. But now he is retiring and Republicans see an opportunity. From member station WPLN Blake Farmer reports on the three candidates vying for the Republican nomination.  Two doctors and a farmer have shelled out more than 5 million between them buying ad time in Memphis and Nashville and stuffing all the mailboxes in between    George Flinn. He is the only...  As his ad in heavy rotation suggests Flinn does stand out. He is a radiologist by trade and made his money owning more than 40 TV and radio stations. Flinn has outspent his opponents three to one by putting in nearly 3 million of his own fortune. Dr.  I did not get it donated from so-and-so. I made it myself and I am spending it to get the message out because my kids my grandkids deserve better than they are getting.  While the big spender even Flinn's own polls show him trailing the other two GOP candidates. Out front has been Stephen Fincher. Mr.  I am from Frog Jump Tennessee. I am a farmer.  Working a room of Republican voters Fincher lays into the party in power and plays up his common man credentials. Mr.  You know I did not graduate college and I am afraid some people with more education than I have will think I am not smart enough. And I had a fellow asked me one day he said well I do not think that is an issue. And he said you are smarter than Nancy Pelosi and Barney Frank are not you? And I said yeah. He said...  Fincher is the National Republican Congressional Committee's pick. The NRCC has helped the political novice's campaign and raised money. Dr.  My question is what does he owe them in return? I do not owe them anything.  Ron Kirkland criticizes Fincher both as connected to Washington but also inexperienced. The first time Fincher traveled to Washington was to meet with the NRCC. Kirkland is a physician from Jackson whose name is better known because of his brother Robert who cofounded the Kirkland's chain of home decor stores. That brother is running something of a shadow campaign. He spent more than a million dollars on an independent expenditure airing ads that slam Kirkland's opponents.   How about a radio mogul whose station promotes gang violence drug abuse and insults women? Well George Flinn is that man.  Negative ads have come from every direction in a race where all three Republicans want to repeal what they call Obamacare. Ron Kirkland has been jabbed for lobbying for direct payments to doctors under the health care overhaul. Since he is calling for spending cuts across the government he is had to backtrack. Dr.  I cannot then turn around and say except for the things that I was for when I was a doctor and in charge of American Medical Group Association. I have to be sincere enough have to be meaningful enough to say let us cut the group that I represented too.  Kirkland has tried deflecting the attention toward the millions of dollars Fincher has received over the years in farming subsidies. Fincher says he has no choice. He is also playing defense for a voting in Democratic primaries as recently as this year. Dr.  If you want to vote in Crockett County in local elections we have never had anything but Democratic primaries.  It shows just how entrenched the Democratic Party still is in Tennessee's 8th Congressional District even though voters here have turned more Republican over the last two decades. The winner of this week's high-spending primary will still have a hill to climb in the general election - a minister-attorney and well-liked state senator named Roy Herron is sitting on a million dollars waiting to meet the GOP nominee on the other side of election night. For NPR News I am Blake Farmer in Nashville.
