 John Boehner says he woke up this morning a day after the pope's historic address to Congress said his prayers and decided today's the day to do this.  Do this meaning resign. Next month Boehner will step down as speaker and leave Congress. John Boehner has had a tumultuous four-and-a-half years with the gavel. This summer some of the most conservative members of his caucus openly talked of a coup.   It is become clear to me that this prolonged leadership turmoil would do irreparable harm to the institution. So this morning I informed my colleagues that I would resign from the speakership and resign from Congress at the end of October.  In a moment we will hear from one member who is been unhappy with Boehner's leadership for years. Today the speaker brushed off the notion he was at risk of being toppled and said he looked forward to the time he has left in the House.   I am going to be here for another five weeks and I am not going to leave. I am not going to sit around here and do nothing for the next 30 days. There is a lot of work that needs to be done and I plan on getting as much of it done as I can before I exit.  At the White House President Obama called Boehner a good man a patriot someone who cares about America.   My hope is there is a recognition on the part of the next speaker - something I think John understood even though at times it was challenging to bring his caucus along - that we can have significant differences on issues but that does not mean you shut down the government. That does not mean you risk the full faith and credit of the United States.  And the president added when you have divided government when you have a democracy compromise is necessary.
