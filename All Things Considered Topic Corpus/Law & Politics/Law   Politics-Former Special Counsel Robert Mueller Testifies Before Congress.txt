 It is been nearly 800 days since Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 election more than a hundred days since he released his report. And today after being subpoenaed Robert Mueller turned up on Capitol Hill.  Lines and lines of people snaked through the long hallways of the Rayburn House Office Building. People were spilling outside. Shortly after 8 this morning the square-jawed former FBI director arrived for his long-awaited turn in the spotlight.   Clear the hall please. Clear the hall.  Here's the man of the hour the focal point of much of the last two years.   A stoic straight-faced Mueller walked into the hearing room past the dozens of journalists lining the halls flanked by security on all sides.   Mr. Mueller what is your message to the president?  And before he even took his seat a protester shouted and was promptly taken outside by security.   Kushner and Manafort downloaded encrypted communications apps on the date of the Trump Tower meeting.  Then House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler of New York began the session...   The Judiciary Committee will come to order.  ...And made his opening statement.   And in this nation not even the president is above the law.  With that the chairman turned to the witness and the hearing began.   Now if you would please rise I will begin by swearing you in. Raise your right hand please. Do you swear or affirm under penalty of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct to the best of your knowledge information and belief so help you God? Let the record show the witness answered the affirmative. Thank you and please be seated.
