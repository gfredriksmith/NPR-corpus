 The other big TV event on Thursday night will be Jon Stewart's final Daily Show. We came across a strange item this past week about Stewart and our current president. On at least two occasions President Obama summoned Jon Stewart to the White House for secret meetings. Politico's Darren Samuelsohn first reported those meetings and he writes that Stewart's influence increased as that of real news anchors faded. So I asked him if he thought Stewart should be treated the same as say Lester Holt if he  were having under-the-radar meetings with the president.  Certainly when the news got out it exploded from the right. People saying oh look this is an example of Jon Stewart as a shill for President Obama. I do not buy that. I think it reinforced the message that Jon Stewart was someone that the administration saw as very important to them. But Stewart has really fought hard that notion that he is a journalist. He is a comic who reads the headlines and does them in a funny way.  Now Jon Stewart did talk with Larry Wilmore on The Nightly Show which is conveniently produced by Jon Stewart.  .  Here's what he had to say to the question we all had.   What did he want?  What'd he want?  Yes what did he want?  Hang out eat nachos.   Watch King Ralph.   The John Goodman movie where he becomes king of England?   do not pretend like you have not seen King Ralph.  So seriously though what did President Obama want?  Jon Stewart went on in the next night to talk quite a bit about what that conversation was like - a couple minutes of President Obama giving Jon Stewart his pitch and Jon Stewart coming back and giving the president his piece of mind. And then they ate some pretty good salmon apparently. But you know for Jon Stewart it is an opportunity to obviously engage and hear what the president has to say. And Obama - from their perspective they see it as an opportunity to work one of the umps. And Jon Stewart has been punching the administration now and again over the course of these last seven years whether it be negotiating with Republicans early on or the Obamacare website catastrophe.  Well people often talk in general terms about Jon Stewart's influence but run us through some specific examples where he is moved the needle on Capitol Hill or in the White House?  It is been on a couple of things - a lot of motherhood-apple pie issues. The first one that jumps out is the 9-11 first responders. Congress was trying to pass a bill that was going to provide billions of dollars in medical benefits for the cops and the firefighters and the people who went down to Ground Zero and there was a big fight. The Republicans in the Senate who were filibustering a House-passed bill - Stewart really lambasted them showed the hypocrisy between the 9-11 patriotism - that they would been waving the flag and blocking of this bill.   So guess what Republicans? Here's the deal. Your we are-the-only-party-that-understands-9-11-and-its-repercussions monopoly ends now. So...   The bill moved pretty quickly thereafter. President Obama signed it by January. This was during the lame-duck Congress as the House Democrats were about to cede control and a lot of people called Jon Stewart you know their Christmas miracle.  You know over the years Jon Stewart has really downplayed his influence. When people talk about him being influential as new anchors you know he says he thinks that is basically silly or that it is a sign of how messed up things are.   But now that we know he is having meetings with the president he cannot just kind of play the I am just a funny guy thing anymore right?  Well obviously he had President Obama on the show I think seven times over the course of President Obama's political career. So we have always known that he was engaging with - and seen as one of the stronger interviewers out there these days. I think Jay Carney at one point said that President Obama's interview with Jon Stewart in 2012 during the presidential election was one of the hardest interviews that he faced that year. So you know Stewart and what his brand has done at the Comedy Central Daily Show has really I think changed the way you know journalists do their jobs. So to be able to kind of make things funny to make things accessible to really get into the weeds of policy he is definitely done something with journalism that you know for the last 15 16 years you know we were not seeing before.  Darren Samuelsohn is Politico's senior policy reporter. Darren thank you.  Thanks for having me.
