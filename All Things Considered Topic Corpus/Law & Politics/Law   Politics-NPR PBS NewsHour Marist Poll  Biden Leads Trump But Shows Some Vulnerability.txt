 There is only about six weeks until Election Day. Some voters are already casting ballots. And former Vice President Joe Biden continues to lead President Trump nationally by a substantial margin - at least that is according to the latest NPRPBS NewsHourMarist poll. There are some important nuances in these numbers and we are going to get to them with NPR's senior political editor and correspondent Domenico Montanaro. Welcome back.  Hey there.  I want to start with the headline. What are the figures that support that?  Well to start with - this is the first time this election cycle we asked about likely voters and of those most likely to vote Biden leads 52 to 43. That is about the same as we have it with the wider universe of registered voters and it is also about where the race has been for months in our poll and others. You know it is really remarkable how steady it is been actually. Even when you add in libertarian nominee Jo Jorgensen and the Green Party's Howie Hawkins Biden's still ahead by seven and he is at 49. What really jumped out to me though in this poll is how Biden is doing with white voters specifically whites with a college degree. I mean this is remarkable. According to 2016 exit polls Trump won this group 48-45. In our poll Biden leads with them 66 to 31.  What are Biden's vulnerabilities?  Well you know the biggest problem for him is that he is not doing as well as Hillary Clinton did with nonwhite voters. And mainly our pollsters are saying that is coming from Latinos. If there is a warning sign for him it is that. And Latinos play an important role in states like Florida which are key to you know the Electoral College and could determine the election because as we all know the national popular vote does not decide who wins.  What did the poll tell you about what is foremost on voters' minds?  Well this really does tell you everything about why we are so divided in this country. I mean depending on what party people are in they care about very different things. For Democrats the top issue is now climate change and that is a shift from just before the 2018 election when health care was top of mind for Democrats. Second is coronavirus then health care more generally the economy and race relations. But for Republicans very different - the top issue for them continues to be the economy and jobs head and shoulders above anything else followed by abortion crime and guns - all culture issues - with coronavirus behind that. So maybe that helps make some sense for why it seems like both parties are not just from different planets but different universes.  Can I ask a little more about coronavirus? What do voters think about the - I do not know - the public health messages that they are getting on COVID-19?  Yeah. Well first of all the thing that jumped out to me is that those saying that they are going to get vaccinated when one comes available has dropped from 60 last month to just 49 now and that is driven by a decline with independents and Republicans. Public health experts are still the most trusted sources of information. Sixty-nine percent of Americans say they trust them but that is down 15 points since March. Almost all of that is driven by Republicans which indicates Trump's campaign against some public health officials has stuck with his base. But it is not like Trump is trusted on this you know? I mean only a third of people said that they trust the information they are getting from their president on coronavirus.  Anything else jump out at you?  I mean the biggest thing here that jumped out that was aside from all the rest is that you know we have been tracking views of Black Lives Matter and protests across the country and we have seen a decline in support. After George Floyd's death 62 in our poll in June supported the protests said they were mostly legitimate as opposed to mostly people acting unlawfully. Now Americans are split 48 to 45. And when it comes to Black Lives Matter still a majority of people have a favorable view but unfavorable views have gone up in the last month from 34 to 40 - big racial and generational splits and most of the movement again comes from downward shifts with Republicans.  Domenico thanks so much.  You are welcome.
