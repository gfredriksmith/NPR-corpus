 This evening we are covering the testimony of Attorney General Jeff Sessions before the Senate intelligence committee. One especially heated exchange was between Sessions and Democratic Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon. Wyden asked the attorney general about the former FBI Director James Comey's comments on Sessions' decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation.   Mr. Comey said that there were matters with respect to the recusal that were problematic and he could not talk about them. What are they?  I - that - why do not you tell me? There are none Senator Wyden. There are none. I can tell you that for absolute certainty.  We can - we...  You tell - this is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me and I do not appreciate it. And I have tried to give my best and truthful answers to any committee I have appeared before. And it is really - people are suggesting through innuendo that I have been not honest about matters. And I have tried to be honest.
