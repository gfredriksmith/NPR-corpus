 Now that Comey has testified you may be wondering what comes next.  And the answer is we do not know.  But leaders of the Senate intelligence committee say they will continue looking into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Russia and the Trump campaign. Right now though they do not have any more open hearings scheduled.  In Congress there are a few other committees investigating largely the same thing. The leaders of the House intelligence committee said this week that they are going to get back on track. But the investigation that really matters is the one being led by a special counsel former FBI Director Robert Mueller. If Mueller believes that someone broke the law he has the authority to prosecute that person in court.  And it is possible that may mean that things in Congress quiet down. Witnesses evidence and other materials that might have been examined in the open by Congress could now become part of Mueller's inquiry. James Comey responded to several of the senators' questions today by deferring to Mueller and he said repeatedly that he has faith in Mueller's ability to get to the bottom of this.
