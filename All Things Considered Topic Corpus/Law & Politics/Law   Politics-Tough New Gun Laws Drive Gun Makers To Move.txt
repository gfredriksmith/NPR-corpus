 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. President Obama and Vice President Biden met today with families who lost loved ones in the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. It has been six months since that attack in Newtown Connecticut in the effort to pass new federal gun laws is stalled in Congress. And some state capitals the story is very different. Five states including Connecticut have passed major new gun regulations. NPR's Joe Rose reports on how the firearms industry is reacting.  In the months after Newtown governors in New York Connecticut and Maryland signed broad new bans on assault weapons. Delaware passed a law requiring universal background checks while Colorado adopted background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazines.  To have this many states have changes in one year is absolutely unprecedented.  Robyn Thomas directs the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. She says gun control advocates are now targeting states they were not even thinking about before.  So if we look at states like Washington and Oregon and Virginia and even Nevada there are opportunities there that we were not able to fully realize this year because this is still sort of a new reality.  But this new reality if that is what it is does not sit well with the firearms industry. In Colorado the company Magpul Industries announced it is moving its 200 jobs out of the state in response to the new laws. In Connecticut at least one rifle maker is planning to move because of the assault weapons ban that was signed in April.  You know I knew that day. I knew that you know once I had finished reading this bill I knew if that passed and became the law of the land that we really would not have a choice but to move.  Josh Fiorini is the CEO of PTR Industries a company that builds high-end semiautomatic rifles at a factory in Bristol Connecticut.  The first stage is somebody is right over here and then final assembly over there.  The new state law makes it illegal to buy PTR's products in Connecticut and Fiorini says vague language in the law makes it unclear whether his 40 employees are in violation when they assemble and transport the weapons.  These are good jobs. Those are skilled tradesmen. You know whether they are the welders the machine operators machine programmers toolmakers you know these are the kind of manufacturing jobs that used to be the backbone of the northeast economy.  Hey if you do not want them we will take them.  Fiorini will not say where the company is moving. Texas is rumored to be the front-runner but he says he is gotten offers from dozens of different states. And firearms makers say they are getting pressure to leave from their customers too.  It is very much a concern if they do not leave the state that consumers and Second Amendment advocates will boycott their product.  Lawrence Keane is the senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation the industry trade association based in Newtown Connecticut. He says the state's new gun law is misguided because it will only affect law-abiding gun owners.  It will do nothing to reduce crime. It will just simply cause a reduction in sales cause these companies to have to let employees go.  But gun control advocates say there is evidence that tougher gun laws like the assault weapons ban that has long been on the books in California do help reduce gun-related deaths. Robyn Thomas at the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence says it is unfortunate that Connecticut may lose jobs because of its new laws but she says that should not be the main concern of state officials.  I would even call it a distraction to the real issue here which is whether or not these laws are effective and save lives. And if that is the case then 50 jobs moving from Connecticut to Texas is really just a side issue.  The final economic cost of the new state gun laws may not be clear for a while. The governors of Texas and South Dakota will be in Connecticut next week to pitch gun makers on their states in person. Joel Rose NPR News New York.
