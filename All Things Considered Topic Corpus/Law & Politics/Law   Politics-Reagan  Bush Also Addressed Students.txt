 Mr. Obama is not the first president to address school kids.  President Ronald Reagan spoke in late 1988. He stood in front of an audience of students in the State Dining Room at the White House.  His speech was less about education specifically and more of a lecture in American history.

It is also a moral vision grounded in the reverence and faith of those who believe that with God's help they could create a free and democratic nation.  President Reagan also said he had a special message from his roommate -the roommate would be Nancy Reagan of course. And her message just say no to drugs.  Three years later President George Herbert Walker Bush spoke from a classroom at a Washington D.C. public school. His speech followed similar things as President Obama's today. President GEORGE H.

Maybe you can cram a week before that marking period ends and turn that C into a B but you cannot con your way past the SAT and into college. And if you do not work hard who gets hurt?

President Bush also told students about someone he called a friend who was traveling the country emphasizing the importance of fitness. That was Arnold Schwarzenegger before we called him governor of California.
