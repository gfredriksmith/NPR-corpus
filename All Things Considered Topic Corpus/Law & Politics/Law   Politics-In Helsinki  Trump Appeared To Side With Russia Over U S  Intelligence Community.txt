 I am Mary Louise Kelly in Helsinki where I sat 40 feet or so away from two world leaders today President Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier today they met one-on-one for more than two hours. Only their interpreters were present. Over a working lunch the group grew. President Trump gave the talks up to that point good reviews.   I think it is a good start - very very good start for everybody.  The day concluded with a remarkable press conference.   Thank you very much.  With a handshake and an uncharacteristically soft-spoken thank you very much to President Putin President Trump opened the press conference. During the session he returned to his election victory. And he questioned what happened to Hillary Clinton's emails.   Thirty-three thousand emails gone - just gone. I think in Russia they would not be gone so easily. I think it is a disgrace that we cannot get Hillary Clinton's 33000 emails.  When a reporter asked whether President Putin wanted candidate Donald Trump to win the election Putin had this to say.   .  Yes I did. I wanted him to win Putin said. And most remarkably President Trump refused to support U.S. intelligence agencies led by director of National Intelligence Dan Coats in their unanimous conclusion that Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election.   People came to me. Dan Coats came to me and some others. They said they think it is Russia. I have President Putin. He just said it is not Russia. I will say this. I do not see any reason why it would be.
