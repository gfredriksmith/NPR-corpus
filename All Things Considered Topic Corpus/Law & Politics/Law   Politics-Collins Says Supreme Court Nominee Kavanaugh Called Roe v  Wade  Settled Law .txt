 Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine is a key swing vote in the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. She says Kavanaugh told her today he views the landmark abortion-rights ruling Roe v. Wade as settled law. As NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow reports Kavanaugh made the statement during the most important meeting he had during today's blitz of meetings on Capitol Hill.  Kavanaugh met with six senators today. None of those meetings lasted as long as the more than two hours he spent with Collins.   We talked about whether he considered Roe to be settled law. He said that he agreed with what Justice Roberts said at his nomination hearing in which he said that it was settled law.  That is a big deal for the Maine senator a moderate Republican who supports abortion rights and supported Roberts back in 2005. But what exactly does settled law mean? Minority leader Chuck Schumer and other Democrats argue not too much especially since President Trump promised to appoint someone who would overturn the landmark ruling that legalized abortion.   Let us be clear. This is not as simple as Judge Kavanaugh saying that Roe is settled law. Everything the Supreme Court decides is settled law until it unsettles it. Saying a case is settled law is not the same thing as saying a case was correctly decided.  But with nearly all Democrats likely to vote no Cavanaugh's key audience is not Schumer. It is moderates like Collins and Alaska Republican Lisa Murkowski. They both support abortion rights. And with Republicans holding a slim majority he needs their votes to be confirmed. Collins sounds like she is almost there.   We covered a wide range of issues. And it was very helpful very productive and very informative.  Still Collins says she will not commit on whether or not to vote for Kavanaugh until after next month's confirmation hearings. Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol.
