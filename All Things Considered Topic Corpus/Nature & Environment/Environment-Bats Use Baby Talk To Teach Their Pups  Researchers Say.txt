Hello my baby. You are so cute. My voice goes up.  That is Ahana Aurora Fernandez. She is in Berlin but did her bat study in Panama. And she found that as many humans do mommy bats talk to baby bats in a similar way. There is a word for this way of talking. It is motherese .

They use sort of a vocal practice behavior which is reminiscent of babbling in infants.  Bat baby talk.  Her team's report was published this month and it shows that in the first three months of life these bat pups experiment with their speech.
