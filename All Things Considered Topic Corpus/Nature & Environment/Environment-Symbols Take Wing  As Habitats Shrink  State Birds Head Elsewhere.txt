 The birds are being pushed out. A new Audubon Society study found that bird habitats are shrinking like crazy because of climate change. Gary Langham led the study.  It is sobering - is not it? - that as many as half the birds in the continental U.S. and Canada could lose half their geographic range by the end of the century.  Gary has a dramatic title - chief scientist for the National Audubon Society.  Someone asked me if I was going to keep that title and I said yes I am.  So as chief scientist Gary led a team of other scientists and together they sifted through mounds of the yearly bird data collected by ordinary bird-loving folk from all over North America. They already knew that as winters get warmer on average a lot of birds move north but the new data predicted something state legislatures might find alarming.  Under our new study eight birds that are state birds are projected to move so far that they will not be in those states anymore.  Louisiana's brown pelican Pennsylvania's roughed grouse the wood thrush of Washington D.C.  One familiar bird that is projected to lose range is the Baltimore oriole. That is the state bird of Maryland. And what the model suggests is that by the end of the century this familiar backyard bird would no longer be in Maryland.  But what if for some strange reason you just do not care about birds?  We are from Audubon so of course we think that you should care about birds. But if you do not care about birds the other reason is as the birds go so does everything else. This should be a wake-up call for all of us.    Orioles magic - feel it happen. O-R-I-O-L-E-S. Magic magic magic.
