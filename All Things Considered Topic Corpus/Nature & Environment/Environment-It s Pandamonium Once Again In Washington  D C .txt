 It is WEEKENDS on ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Jacki Lyden. We have a cub. 32 p.m. last night. The zoo's giant panda Mei Xiang gave birth to her third cub Friday. Now there is a state of wait for it pandamonium here in Washington. Thousands of eyes were glued to the zoo's panda cam as the tiny creature came into the world.   After those tiny cries mom quickly scooped up and cradled her offspring. Now before you get the image of an adorable speckled teddy bear in your mind you should know that panda babies are kind of weird-looking creatures. Do not take that the wrong way Mei Xiang. There seems to be a consensus though on how to describe them at least here.   When first born pandas are pink and the size of a stick of butter.  Just about the size of a stick of butter.  The size of a stick of butter.  The size of a stick of butter.  I can remember when he was the size of a butter stick. We came down here...  This is such an exciting moment because zookeepers were not even aware that Mei Xiang was pregnant until earlier this month. Last September her second cub died from a liver problem just six days after its birth. Mei Xiang is expected to stay in her den with her new cub for the next two weeks and the panda cams will be rolling. Let the cub watch begin.
