 Imagine flying an airplane for 26 hours without using a single drop of fuel. Well that is what Andre Borschberg did. He is the pilot of the Solar Impulse an experimental solar-powered plane. Today he completed a 26-hour test flight after gliding in loops over the Jura Mountains west of the Swiss Alps. The plane's 12000 solar cells absorbed sunlight during the day to power its journey overnight. Andre Borschberg says the solo flight was an amazing experience. Mr.  I had the chance to fly during the beautiful day with a very wonderful sunset with a gorgeous night and with a small moon coming out at 2 oclock and of course a wonderful sunrise. And of course when the sun is rising you start to get energy and things start to be alive. So that was a very special moment.  A former Swiss Air Force pilot Borschberg says the Solar Impulse was totally unlike any other airplane he is flown. One thing in particular it makes little noise. Mr.  It is extremely agreeable. I think you know it is the first time that when you fly an airplane you can also listen to other sounds. So that is new. That is very uncommon but I tell you it is not unpleasant.  The four-engine plane flew to over 28000 feet at a maximum speed of 78 miles per hour. It is considered the longest and highest flight by a solar-powered craft but Borschberg says the Solar Impulse is about more than just breaking records. Mr.  This airplane is fundamentally a project about energy savings and the end result is an airplane the size of an Airbus of a big Airbus with a 64-meters wingspan but extremely light extremely efficient. And so we need very little energy to fly it and to fly it day and night and hopefully in the future to fly also long distance.  Borschberg and his team now plan to build a more sophisticated solar-powered plane one that can cross the Atlantic.  to circle the globe.
