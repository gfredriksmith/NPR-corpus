 While many DC reporters are focused on the White House or Capitol Hill news of a different stripe has been grabbing attention.  Five zebras are on the loose in the D.C. suburbs in Prince George's County Md.  The dazzle - that is what you call a group of zebras by the way - were owned legally and escaped from a farm in the area. And for the last month they have been dazzling residents with surprise sightings.  I look over. I see like three zebras right here. And I am like are my eyes playing tricks on me? Do I have my glasses off?  That is Davon Bennett talking to local Fox 5 after the zebras showed up in his backyard.  They have been seen running across roads and bounding out of woods.   Got a video this morning of the zebras. Them bad boys ran right across the street.  Keith Turner caught a cameo on his phone.   I am getting kind of close to them. They running. They running. They running.  County animal services - well they are aware of the situation. But catching a zebra is tricky. I mean they spook easily.  As for who might have helped the zebras escape?  Hands up - I did not do it.  D.C.'s Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton has been jokingly accused. She is been very anti-fence wanting to remove barriers put up around D.C. after the January 6 attacks. And while she swears she did not do it Norton thinks maybe she inspired them.  And they said look if she can get those fences down we do not want to be fenced in either.  For Norton and many others in D.C. the zebras have become a metaphor for D.C. statehood.  I represent a city where there is no consent of the governed. And the zebras say guess what? There is no consent to keep us caged in either.  You hear that America? Norton says Washington D.C. is ready to be a state. Just ask the zebras - that is if they ever get caught.    Oh give me land lots of land under starry skies above.
