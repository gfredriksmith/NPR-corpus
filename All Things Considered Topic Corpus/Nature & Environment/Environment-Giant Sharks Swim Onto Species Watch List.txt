 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. This year the federal government declared that basking sharks in the Pacific Ocean are a species of concern. That means the government does not have enough information to say the giant fish is threatened or endangered but it might be. And when we say giant fish we are not exaggerating. The basking shark is about the length of a school bus. Here's NPR's Joe Palca.  Fisheries research biologist Heidi Dewar is a serious scientist. But when she describes why basking sharks are interesting to study technical language just will not do.  They are just really cool and amazing-looking and beautiful.  Dewar works for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's fishery service in La Jolla California.  There is nothing like just driving up in a boat to one of these monstrous brown creatures slowly gently peacefully swimming through the ocean.  Dewar says basking sharks can grow as long as 30 feet or more and of course they have that distinctive dorsal fin that can poke out of the water when they are near the surface. You might find it intimidating to be anywhere near a 30-foot long shark but Dewar says you really do not have to worry about being attacked by a basking shark.  Similar to the other large elasmobranchs like whale sharks and manta rays they are filter feeders.  Yes she said elasmobranchs.  Elasmobranchs are the sharks and rays that is the subgroup of fish that sharks and rays fall into.  Got that? Instead of swimming after their dinner basking sharks just open their cavernous mouths. Comb-like structures called gill rakers filter tasty critters like krill out of the water for the sharks to dine on. The sharks do have teeth but not the kind that would inspire fear.  If you took a grain of rice and cut it in half that is what the teeth of a basking shark looks like.  Greg Skomal is a shark specialist with the state of Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries. He says basking sharks probably do not use their teeth at all for eating.  However I do think they are used by the males to grasp onto the females during courtship and during mating. So I do believe that the teeth are not completely useless.  Skomal has been studying the sharks in the Atlantic. He says until recently scientists thought the sharks mostly stayed in the cooler Atlantic waters off North America. But over the last decade satellite tracking data have told a different story.  Here we have a species that we thought was largely a cool water animal migrating down south into tropical waters as far south as South America and as far south as south of the equator.  NOAA's Heidi Dewar says that now that her agency has declared the basking shark a species of concern there is a pot of money for doing similar tracking studies for the sharks in the Pacific. She is not only interested in whether the sharks are swimming north and south along the eastern Pacific shoreline but also...  If they are traveling across the Pacific and consequently interacting with high seas fisheries or with fisheries over off of Japan or China or Taiwan.  Dewar says there is a concern that Asian fleets might be taking the shark for its prized fins. She says the effort to protect the basking shark has implications that go beyond a single species.  You know one thing about this charismatic megafauna is that I think they really help people to connect with life in the ocean.  Connect in a way it is clear Heidi Dewar already has.
