 How do you put a dollar value on poop?   It is a very interesting question Ari. As it turns out though the answer could help save seabirds.   Around the world seabirds are under threat. There is climate change overfishing plastic pollution invasive cats and rats that eat bird eggs.  Now to raise awareness researchers have put a dollar value on the birds' poop also known as guano.  They call the guano the white gold.  White gold. Daniel Plazas-Jimenez is one of the authors on the new report in the journal Trends in Ecology  Evolution. He says South America already knows the value of guano as a fertilizer. It is been an economic engine for countries like Peru since the 1800s.  But his team put a price on all the poop that humans do not harvest which also has value. For example it fertilizes coral reefs which helps fish populations which in turn is really good for fishermen.  Overall the scientists estimate the white gold excreted by penguins pelicans and other seabirds is worth nearly half a billion dollars a year.  What the city is trying to say is when these wondrous birds that fiercely navigate the globe come to rest on a rock in the ocean and poop people can benefit.  Rebecca Shaw is chief scientist of the Worldwide Fund for Nature. She says some people value nature simply because they love it.  But others are more convinced by an economic argument. And if bird poop is a treasure then maybe we should cherish the birds it comes from too.
