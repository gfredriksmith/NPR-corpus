 Edwin Chota wanted to stop illegal loggers from operating on his community's land in the Peruvian Amazon. His efforts gained international attention and also death threats. This week we learned he and three other community leaders were killed and dismembered at the beginning of the month. The news of the murders was delayed because of the remote location where they occurred. People in the area say illegal loggers are suspected in the killings. Here to discuss Chota's life and legacy is his friend David Salisbury. He is a professor of geography and the environment at the University of Richmond. Welcome to the program.  Thank you for having me.  First I want to say sorry for the loss of your friend. Can you tell us a little bit about how you met?  I first met Edwin a decade ago when I was doing my doctoral dissertation research in the remote borderlands of Peru. It is a community of Ashaninka indigenous folk people practicing a largely subsistence lifestyle with agriculture hunting fishing but also extracting some hardwoods so that they could buy much-needed supplies such as clothing soap medicine. But unfortunately it was also an area that was filled with illegal loggers who are actively looking to take as much timber out as possible.  These hardwoods that you mentioned - mahogany and cedar right? I mean how widespread is illegal logging?  Illegal logging is very widespread in all of the Amazon and particularly in Peru. Commercially-sized trees of mahogany and tropical cedar are essentially gone and now the loggers are moving down a list of valuable hardwoods.  I was reading that an old-growth mahogany tree can get upwards of 11000 right - per tree?  Yes that would be what you might get in a lumberyard in a developed country but of course once you know it is parceled out into furniture and other goods you are talking about up over 100000.  But the U.S. does have a ban on these kinds of imports does it not?  It does. There is an international ban on the traffic of mahogany but they seem to reach not only the United States but also Europe. China is increasingly a player. So there seems to be a way to circumvent the control of these particular species.  Tell us about Edwin Chota's activism because he was not an official investigator. He did not have a lot of resources. I mean how did he actually go about trying to stop this activity?  Edwin was irrepressible. He always had incredible energy incredible charisma and a real sense of right and wrong.  There was one story we heard about him actually floating down the river with the illegal timber.  Well what he would do at times is he would notice when the timber was being taken out - floated downstream. And he would follow it until it got to the sawmill where he would confront the sawmill owners the loggers themselves and get the authorities to seize the timber. This is not an easy thing to do - to motivate the authorities to fulfill their functions and also to confront these well-armed extremely powerful individuals. But he was unafraid.  David Salisbury what is been the response in the region or from Peru's government?  To date there is been very little response from the Peruvian government. In fact no authorities have actually arrived at the scene of the crime however today just across the border in the Ashaninka village of Apucha ...  And this is the border of Brazil?  This is in Brazil. So the Brazilian Ashaninka the cousins of the people who were murdered - Edwin  Jorge  Francisco  and Leoncio  are moving across the border to recover the bodies and ensure the safety of the people of Soweto because Edwin was not the only person with a death threat on his head. The entire community is threatened by the illegal loggers and now they have lost their charismatic leader.  David Salisbury thanks so much for speaking with us.  Thank you.  David Salisbury - he is a professor of geography and the environment at the University of Richmond. He was speaking to us about his friend Edwin Chota an outspoken Peruvian opponent of illegal logging who was killed earlier this month.                                         During this conversation it was stated that the U.S. has a ban on mahogany imports from Peru. It does not. Peru has an annual export quota on bigleaf mahogany. The U.S. monitors imports from Peru against that annual quota. The volume of mahogany wood imported into the U.S. from Peru has decreased over the past nine years from over 22000 cubic meters in 2005 to 224 cubic meters in 2013.
