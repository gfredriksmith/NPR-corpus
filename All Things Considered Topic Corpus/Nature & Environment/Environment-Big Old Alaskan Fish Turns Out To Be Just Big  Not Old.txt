 And now a big fish story. Last month a fisherman off the coast of Sitka Alaska brought in a record-breaking shortraker rock-fish. At nearly 40 pounds and three and a half feet long the bug-eyed bright orange beast is the biggest fish of its kind ever caught by a recreational fisherman.  But even more exciting was its potential age. Based on its size state wildlife specialists estimated that the rock-fish could be about 200 years old old enough to have hatched back when Alaska belonged to Russia when James Madison was president.  So they decided to find out. And how does one determine the age of a giant rock-fish? They turned to a lab in Juneau where scientists examined its ear bones.  They count the rings. It is very similar to what you would have on a tree. They have annual growth rings.  Troy Tydingco manages sport fishing in Sitka for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. He says this rock-fish was far from a contemporary of Kierkegaard Dr. Livingston or Stephen Douglas.  Yesterday morning we finally did get the age back and this fish was actually only 64 years old.   Barely old enough for Social Security a contemporary of George Foreman and Wolfgang Puck. Is that still pretty old for a fish?  For a rock-fish especially a shortraker that is more run of the mill.  So this heavyweight rock-fish was just big enough to fool them.  Well it was a good grower.  But not quick enough to be the one that got away.
