 If you were to go deep into the Santa Cruz Mountains in California you might hear the wind rustling in the leaves and maybe a mountain lion chewing on a deer carcass.  But occasionally that scene has been interrupted by something like this.   This is not good for the country what is happening here because it is not I do not think full-fledged legitimate.  For seven months researchers from UC Santa Cruz gathered the reactions of mountain lions at their kill sites to the voices of political talk show hosts - Rush Limbaugh Glenn Beck Amy Goodman and Rachel Maddow.   Last Tuesday when Bobby Jindal quit the presidential race.  We wanted to know if mountain lions directly perceived humans as a threat to them.  That is Justine Smith lead author of the study.  We found a more dramatic response than even we anticipated. Pumas completely fled from the sound of humans talking on almost every occasion. And they reduced their feeding after being exposed to people.  But when researchers played the sounds of frogs for the predators...   ...They were mostly ambivalent.  So if you ever come across a mountain lion when you are out on a hike do not croak - try airing your political grievances.
