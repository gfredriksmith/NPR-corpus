 Mary Louise can you name all of the Earth's oceans?  Easy. There are four - the Pacific Atlantic Indian and Arctic.  Nah not so fast. National Geographic is adding a fifth to their maps.  National Geographic has been making maps and atlases and globes for over a hundred years. And this is the first time we have ever changed our set of oceans official oceans.  That is Alex Tait from the National Geographic Society. This week the society recognized the waters encircling Antarctica as the Southern Ocean but those who study the area were way ahead of the society.  To be completely honest with you I was rather surprised because I had always thought of the Southern Ocean as its own ocean. I think most of the scientists who work down there really understand how the Southern Ocean is its own thing.  Cassandra Brooks is an assistant professor at the University of Colorado Boulder. She says unlike the other oceans that are primarily defined by the land areas that surround them the Southern Ocean is different.  It is defined by a powerful set of currents called the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which is an ocean current that flows clockwise around the continent. It is critical because...  It is driving currents all over the world regulating our currents as well. And so it really is this amazing - I do not know. I almost think about it as like the lungs or the heart. Right? Like it is pumping. It is pumping water  - right? - throughout the world's ocean.  Both Tait and Brooks hope this new recognition will create more awareness.  Antarctica's so far away that most people do not think about it on a day-to-day basis. They are not seeing how important it is to literally all of our survival. Right? So I just - I hope it can take this obscure place and bring it to people and that they will be excited to learn more about it.  Guess it is time to officially update all those maps.
