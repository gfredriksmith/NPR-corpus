 Maybe you thought we were done talking about cicadas.   No such luck - Brood X cicadas began emerging by the trillions weeks ago from the East Coast to the Midwest. And we have got weeks to go before they are gone.   Now cicadas are harmless but that does not mean they cannot be annoying. I am on the West Coast but anyone who has lived through the great cicada emergence of 2021 will tell you these things are just big old prehistoric drones that do not fly very well. They bump into windows walls people and they get into just about everything even plane engines.  Yeah like last night when dozens of journalists covering President Biden's first trip abroad had their flight from the D.C. area to Europe delayed for several hours - a swarm of cicadas had found their way into the engines causing as you might imagine some mechanical problems. White House aides had to scramble and get the press on another flight.  Biden's plane Air Force One was unaffected but the president himself was not so lucky. This morning at Joint Base Andrews he paused to talk with a military officer while crossing the tarmac to his Europe-bound jet. That is when one of the dopey dive-bombers zeroed in on Biden's neck.   Watch out for the cicadas. I just got one. It got me.  Even presidents have to keep on their toes during cicada season which should wrap up in July.  In the meantime if you are traveling overseas may we suggest a cruise?
