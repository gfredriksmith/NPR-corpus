 Communication is key they say. And nowhere is that more true than in the Amazon where thousands of animals fight for resources. In that crowded rainforest the red-handed tamarin a squirrel-sized monkey with brightly colored hands relies on sound to mark its territory.   This is a territorial call. It is basically this is mine.  Tainara Sobroza is a biologist at the National Institute of Amazonian Research in Brazil. She says in one corner of the Amazon the red-handed tamarin competes with a similar species the pied tamarin. And when they meet it can spark vocal battles or worse.  They call a lot. Sometimes they even - they fight. And these can be very ugly fights.  But in studying these vocal battles she and her colleague Pedro Pequeno have now discovered a curious phenomenon. Writing in the journal Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology they say the red-handed tamarins sometimes tweak the sound of their territorial battle cry to sound more like the pied tamarin's call. It is as if they are adopting an accent Pequeno says.  There is a certain range of types of sounds they can produce and they can modulate those sounds a little bit.  Here's what the new call sounds like.   Might sound similar to our ears but the researchers say adopting a common language of sorts may help the monkeys identify each other more easily and thus avoid conflict.  If they sound the same everybody will understand that that area is occupied.  The pied tamarin is already critically endangered imperiled by both the red-handed tamarin and the expansion of a nearby city. But scientists hope studying these monkey conflicts could help in the conservation of this disappearing tiny primate.
