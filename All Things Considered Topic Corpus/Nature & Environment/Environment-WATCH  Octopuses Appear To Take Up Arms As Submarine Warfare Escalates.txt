 OK let us lighten things up a little bit. There may be an octopus arms race underway. That is not some lame joke about tentacles. Octopuses are actually fighting. It turns out the creatures are not really team players.  Octopuses in general are regarded as fairly solitary animals.  Peter Godfrey-Smith is a marine biologist at the Graduate Center City University of New York. He is studying octopuses in Jervis Bay Australia.   A particular group of them have started living in higher concentrations than usual which we think is because of some peculiarities of the site where they live. And essentially they have had to we think learn to get on with a little. They have had to learn to interact more than octopuses normally have to do.  There is fighting what Peter calls boxing and even bullying.  There seems to be a lot of ornery behavior which has to do with policing and guarding territory.  And it gets worse - the ornery octopuses also hurl objects.  Shells sometimes it is bits of seaweed and then blast out the contents of what they are holding under high pressure.  Peter says there may be other explanations for this behavior. But the number of direct hits has him suspecting the octopuses are using projectile weapons.  It would be quite significant if it is happening. In general projectile use is pretty rare among animals.  Peter's been collaborating on this octopus work with David Scheel from Alaska Pacific University. And he says they have got a lot more observing to do before coming to firm conclusions about the shell-chucking octopuses. In the meantime he refuses to be baited by sensationalistic reporters. Have you seen Stanley Kubrick's 2001?  Yes I have.  Remember the apes and the monolith? It is just a hop skip and a jump from weapons to rocket ships right?  A hop skip and a fairly substantial jump. The prospects for octopus takeover I think is still fairly remote at present.  Marine biologist Peter Godfrey-Smith.
