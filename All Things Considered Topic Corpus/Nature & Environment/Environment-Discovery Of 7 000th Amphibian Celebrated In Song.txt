 Now to a celebration. Well it is actually more along the lines of...   Yes. Today we the warm-blooded honor those who are not - namely amphibians. That is because of the discovery of the 7000th species of amphibian. A website called AmphibiaWeb at the University of California Berkeley is keeping count.   Oh and they wrote a song about it.   Well the song is written and performed by a friend of AmphibiaWeb Connor Lockridge so in his rock star moments he goes by the name The Wiggly Tendrils.   You listen to it a couple of times and it sort of catches in there does not it?  That is David Wake. He is the website's founding member and an expert on salamanders at Berkeley. By the way for those keeping track at home the 7000th species of amphibian is called Centrolene sabini a type of glass frog from Peru but Wake says they have already surpassed that number.  We have - oh let me check AmphibiaWeb. We list the number of species. We are already up to 7006.   That is a lot of amphibians but write a song about it? Seriously?  Most people have positive feelings towards amphibians. Just think about The Muppets for example. You know Kermit the Frog. They are kind of harmless benign organisms that speak to our childhood. I remember the first time I found a salamander. I remember it to this day.  Man or muppet or amphibian it is kind of sweet actually.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
