 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. In Kentucky more people die from abusing prescription drugs than from car accidents. State health experts and government leaders are doing what they can to reduce drug abuse deaths. But as reporter Brenna Angel of member station WUKY reports Kentucky needs to reach beyond its borders if it is really going to make a difference.  At the Pain Treatment Center of the Bluegrass in Lexington Dr. Peter Wright sees a lot of patients. DR.  Can you bend backwards for me? Does that bother you Bud?  Yeah.  Many have been injured in car wrecks or work-related accidents. This patient a former coal miner is getting an epidural.  We are there. I am going to put the medicine in. OK?  Wright uses what he calls a comprehensive approach to pain management which includes prescription drugs. But before he writes a prescription he does a little investigation. He logs into a state database to check how often patients have been prescribed opiates and whether they are seeing multiple physicians.  We use it essentially daily either myself or one of my designates.  The database is called ntucky All Schedule Prescription Electronic Reporting system. Every state except Missouri has set up its own system. It allows doctors pharmacists and law enforcement to see if people are doctor shopping but Wright says there is a problem. These monitoring programs only keep track of data within that particular state and Kentucky borders seven states.  In many cases it is somewhat frustrating because you may have the Kentucky results immediately the Ohio system later and you come to find out that the patient also has family in West Virginia.  Many people see multiple doctors for valid reasons but others do it to feed an addiction or to sell the drugs. More than 11 million prescriptions were filled in Kentucky last year and about 8 percent of those were written by an out-of-state doctor as far as Florida and California. In 2005 Congress passed legislation to establish a network of state prescription monitoring programs. Charlie Cichon is with the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators.  That was really mirrored after the Kentucky KASPER program that was looking at connecting the states but because of funding that program never took off.  Cichon says what has not worked at the federal level is now gaining momentum in the private sector. Over the past year 10 states have started to share data through a program called the PMP InterConnect. DR.  The system works quite easily.  That is Carmen Catizone of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy which operates the InterConnect.  To date we have processed over 500000 requests from the states and the processing time is averaging about five seconds per request.  Pharmaceutical companies fund the InterConnect and there is no charge to states for the first five years. After that Catizone says the NABP will have a fee structure in place. The InterConnect has the support of congressman Hal Rogers a Kentucky Republican. A grant program to help states set up prescription monitoring systems bears his name. He is recently introduced legislation that would help organizations establish guidelines for interstate networks but Rogers says that is as far as the federal government should go.  I do not like the idea of a huge federal bureaucracy and a database. I think it would be cumbersome. States ought to be allowed to operate a system that fits their needs and their desires.  The InterConnect expects to have 20 states exchanging prescription data within the coming months and other organizations are working on setting up their own networks.
