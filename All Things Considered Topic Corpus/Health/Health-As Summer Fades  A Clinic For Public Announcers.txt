 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Soon at high schools across the country Friday nights will once again sound like this.  Mr.  Number 24 Jesse Hilber on the return for the Wildcats tackled by number 77 Larry Pelk. Ball spotted at the Wildcats  And already football players are out on the field scrimmaging. But the players are not the only ones who need practice.  The announcer you just heard is Jeff Kurtz. And he was demonstrating his craft at a clinic that he runs in Hudson Ohio. Dan Bobkoff of member station WCPN went to see what it takes to be the voice of the game.  So you want to be a PA announcer? Jeff Kurtz says there are a few things you need to know. Mr.  You are not a radio guy. You are not a play-by-play announcer. You are not a color man or a color woman. You are a public address announcer.  Kurtz is the announcer at many Kent State University games. That means he is the voice for the fans in the stands. On this Saturday he is in the Hudson High School library training announcers young and old experienced and novice on the finer points of the craft. Mr.  I am going to need people to come up in pairs. One of you will serve as a spotter and one will serve as a public address announcer.  Among the most enthusiastic and the youngest is 13-year-old Jordan Walker. He is the first to volunteer to call a practice game off a videotape. Mr.  Hooper takes the snap. He hands it off to Smith. And he is tackled at around the 35 yard line. Thank you very much. Mr.  All right. Let us give him a round of applause.   Clearly this kid Walker is going places. He is already calling youth baseball games and wants this to be his career. Mr.  One I talk a lot. And two I like sports. So I am thinking okay I probably do not have much of a shot at being an athlete because that is like a one in a million. So why not still be at the games for free and get to call the games and actually get paid to be at the games?  But most of the men and women here happily do it for free. Mr.  Best seat in the house.  Jim Mundt of Maumee Ohio has been calling high school games for 40 years. He says the announcer often gets the best view and a guaranteed ticket. Mr.  Either through heat or cold or rain or snow you are there and that is great protection. What more of a comfort seat is that?  Mundt has been to every clinic he can get to. They are offered by the National Association of Sports Public Address Announcers. And he says they really help him refine his skills. There is the practical advice like make sure your roster is taped down in case there is a gust of wind keep a bullhorn in case the power goes out and write the names of the players phonetically or else you will get some angry parents coming to your booth. But clinic leader Kurtz says some professional sports announcers are becoming showmen.     He is more of a purist. He says an announcer at a high school game does not need to be boring but should not attract attention. Mr.  Because the focus is supposed to be on the student athletes and on the game not on all that extraneous stuff.  And as the announcers practice at this clinic some like Andy Mark are mindful of how hard it is. Mr.  He is looking past throws to the right side . Oh I cannot tell where the ball went.  Mr.  I cannot tell what happened or not.  Kurtz' the microphone is always on. For NPR News I am Dan Bobkoff in Cleveland.
