 And Robert we are going to take a turn now from marijuana to ice cream.  Right some would say a natural transition but in the case of Ben  Jerry's not necessarily all natural. The company that brought us Chubby Hubby Chunky Monkey Cherry Garcia and Phish Food is taking the phrase all natural off its ice cream.  That is because of pressure from a watchdog called The Center for Science in the Public Interest. Michael Jacobson is the Executive Director. Mr.  I looked at the ingredients and some had cocoa processed with alkali. Others had corn syrup and corn syrup solids. One had partially hydrogenated soybean oil. All of these things are factory made. They do not occur in nature.  Jacobson said he first contacted Ben  Jerry's parent company Unilever back in 2002. Eight years later the label all natural was still stamped on pints of Ben  Jerry's and Jacobson was fed up. Mr.  So we wrote another letter to Unilever asking about this urging them to change it and suggesting we might take legal action if we they did not change it.  Well yesterday Unilever announced they would make that change. But the company stresses it did not violate any food-labeling rules by calling Ben  Jerry's all natural.  We got that straight from someone very important at Ben  Jerry's. Mr.  On my business card it says grand poobah of public relations.  The Grand Poobah Sean Greenwood has been working for Ben  Jerry's for more than 20 years. And Greenwood says the company is taking all natural off its packaging because it is tired of arguing over semantics. Mr.  We are still using natural ingredients and we are also really proud about the fair trade commitments that we have made and the cage-free eggs that we are using or bovine-growth-hormone-free milk that we are using and we can concentrate more on those. And those things for us are the bigger-picture issues.   Ben  Jerry' banana ice cream fudge chunks walnuts and a little alkalized cocoa.
