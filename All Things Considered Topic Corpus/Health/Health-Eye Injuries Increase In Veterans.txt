 Joining me is retired Colonel Robert Mazzoli. He is a former consultant in ophthalmology to the Army's Surgeon General. Welcome to the program.  Thank you for having me.  Why do we se so many eye injuries and why has the number increased compared to previous conflicts?  And the very very small shards and pieces of shrapnel that would hit on the forehead and maybe cause a little cut or maybe a scar if it hits the eye that causes visual and ocular devastation.  Are lenses or goggles or polycarbonate lenses for instances any of those things effective?  Because of that reluctance to distort vision or reduce vision then there is a natural reluctance to put anything in front of the eyes. Certainly at the beginning of this conflict the global war on terrorism we had that same reluctance and consequently we also saw a dramatic spike in the percentage of eye injuries. But very quickly the soldiers saw that the eye armor that we did have is effective.  Colonel Mazzoli we hear plenty about research in prosthetics and research and discussion about treatments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Why is there not more attention paid to eye injuries?  There are researchers out there in a variety of locations across the country that are actually getting the optic nerves to regenerate after trauma - that is Earth-shattering. But the level of funding is certainly lagging behind the devastating visual loss.  That is retired Colonel Robert Mazzoli. He is a former consultant in ophthalmology to the Army's Surgeon General. Colonel thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
