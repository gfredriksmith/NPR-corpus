 Montana has one of the country's lowest coronavirus infection rates and it is throwing the door back open to tourists. The state has dropped a two-week quarantine requirement for out-of-state visitors. Not everyone is on board with this decision like the Blackfeet Nation whose reservation borders Glacier National Park. Montana Public Radio's Aaron Bolton reports.   For more than 25 years Blackfeet tribal member Darrel Norman has set up dozens of teepee near his home on the reservation providing guests from all over the world with a unique place to stay while exploring neighboring Glacier National Park.   Hello.  Come in. Let me get my mask.  Norman's home gallery is full of traditional Blackfeet-style paintings and art. It is normally bustling with tourists this time of year. But with the Blackfeet tribal government not going along with the state and maintaining a 14-day quarantine order and lodging restrictions on nonresidents it is quiet now. And the future is unclear.  Bookings are still coming in and all we can say is we are closed through June. We doubt that we are not going to open a teepee camp after. Costs just all the things considered - probably not the wisest thing to do.  Tribal leaders say the population here is vulnerable to COVID-19 and that the restrictions have helped spare residents from the pandemic. While Norman hopes to salvage his season by mostly selling artwork he understands the tribe's caution.  We do not want to be the ones who bring in the first case.  But tribal member Nathan St. Goddard says local leaders are not listening to the economic concerns of businesses like his. He owns Johnson's of St. Mary restaurant and campground perched on a hill overlooking Glacier National Park's east entrance.  Our authority is the tribal council and right now they want to stay closed. And I think it is really frustrating on our end - is because I personally think that social distancing enforcement is more realistic than just total shutdown.  St. Goddard says without tourists from the park he will likely have to shutter the business his grandfather started 70 years ago. With things here at a standstill communities on the other side of the park that does not border the reservation are welcoming back tourists. A park ranger says it is busy.  30 this morning so pretty early.  Tribally owned businesses say they need either economic relief or to open again to tourists. Some are frustrated Blackfeet leaders have not specified what it will take for the reservation to welcome visitors back. Glacier attracted 3 million people last year who spent more than 100 million in tribal communities. Robert DesRosier is the Blackfeet incident commander.  It is a million-dollar question far as I am concerned. I cannot tell you that we are going to open 5 of July 6 of July Fourth of July. It is just - it is impossible for me to say that.  DesRosier says he understands the tribe's decisions are causing economic pain. But he says it is his job to look at this as an issue of protecting human life and not an economic crisis.
