 The patient suffered from cancer of the trachea. NPR's Richard Knox has the story.  As the tumor grew it was getting harder and harder for him to breathe. Doctors have successfully transplanted windpipes taken from organ donors. But Andemarian's doctor Tomas Gudbjardsson said that was not an option for him.  That often means a long wait. In this case his symptoms were already that prominent that something had to be done.  Gudbjardsson remembered reading about an Italian surgeon who is trying to create organs in the lab.  My dream was always to transplant the safest and best windpipe.  They added a cocktail of growth factors to transform the stem cells into cartilage as in a normal windpipe. A couple of days later the synthetic trachea was ready to replace Andemarian's diseased windpipe. The operation took nearly 13 hours. That was a month ago.  Well he can breathe he can cough. He has all the functionality of a normal windpipe and he is without tumor. So that is a great thing for him.  It was difficult to breathe before?  It was difficult yes.  And now?  Now it is better. I am not exactly 100 percent but I am good.  Richard Knox NPR News.
