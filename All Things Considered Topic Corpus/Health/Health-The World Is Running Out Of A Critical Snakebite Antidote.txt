 The world's stockpile of crucial treatment for poisonous snakebites will soon run out according to the aid group Doctors Without Borders. NPR's Michaeleen Doucleff has more.  The treatment is called Fav-Afrique and it is only anti-venom approved to neutralize the bites of 10 deadly African snakes like spitting cobras carpet vipers and black mambas. Dr. Gabriel Alcoba of Doctors Without Borders says he is watched Fav-Afrique save many lives in Africa.  I saw a small child who had been bitten on the face. His whole face had swollen. He could practically not breathe and you could not see his eyes.  Then the child got Fav-Afrique.  It was resolved in two days and the child could go home.  Fav-Afrique is produced by just one company Sanofi Pasteur in France. The company stopped production last year and now the world's last batch of Fav-Afrique is set to expire next summer. Alcoba says deaths and amputations from snakebites are certain to dramatically rise.  I think it is really a health crisis. I mean we are speaking about more than 30000 deaths a year. This is an epidemic. This is comparable with many other diseases.  Alcoba says governments and the World Health Organization need to step up to the plate to find another manufacturer. Gregory Hartl is a spokesperson for WHO. He says for them it is a big concern. But the agency only has one person working on snakebites.  We have been unable to get donor support to do more in this area.  Supplies of the anti-venom in the U.S. and other countries are not affected by this impending shortage.
