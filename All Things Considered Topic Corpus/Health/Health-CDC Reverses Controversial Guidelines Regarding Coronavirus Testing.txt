 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reversed its controversial recommendation that people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus do not necessarily have to get tested. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein joins us now with the latest. Hi Rob.  Hey there Sacha.  And Rob can you remind us briefly - what is this controversy about?  It started last month when some guidelines on the CDC website suddenly changed. The new language suggested that people who might have been exposed to the coronavirus do not necessarily have to get tested to see if they have been infected. And that set off all kinds of alarm bells.  Right. Explain to us - why is that so concerning that change?  Yeah. So you know the key to stopping the spread of the virus is finding people who might have been exposed to the virus as soon as possible and testing them as soon as possible to stop them from spreading the virus even more you know and to prevent new outbreaks from occurring. I talked to Marc Lipsitch about this. He is an epidemiologist at Harvard.  To recommend that that is not necessary is undermining one of the key strategies that has been successful in many places in controlling this pandemic.  You know so the idea that the CDC might be questioning that just kind of shocked and dismayed public health experts. That prompted CDC Director Robert Redfield to put out a statement trying to clarify the change almost immediately. And again just this week during congressional testimony he tried to say the agency was not saying any possibly exposed people should not get tested. But there is still a lot of confusion about that the CDC was actually saying.  And now the CDC has reversed that guidance. What exactly did the agency do?  Right. So the CDC posted revised language on the website today that says this - and I will read it - it says if you have been in close contact such as within 6 feet of a person with documented SARS-CoV-2 infection - that is the virus that causes COVID-19 - for at least 15 minutes and do not have symptoms you need a test. And it goes on to say testing is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. And that is really important because it is become clear that a lot of people who are spreading the virus do not necessarily have any symptoms. So it is really important to catch these so-called silent spreaders fast.  What has the reaction been to this?  Public health experts are definitely glad to see the CDC reversing the guidance and making it clear that anyone who might have been exposed to the virus should get tested. I talked to Joshua Sharfstein at Johns Hopkins about this.  I think this is a step on the road for CDC's regaining credibility. I think this is both an attempt to get the policy right and an attempt for CDC to reassert that the agency will be back in control of its communications.  And Rob the CDC's credibility has been an issue for a while. What can you tell us about that?  Yeah. Yeah. There is been a lot of concern about the Trump administration you know undermining the CDC's integrity and its independence. Earlier this week some emails came out indicating that political appointees might be meddling with the CDC's scientific reports. And several news organizations reported that the White House was behind this testing back-and-forth. Here's Mark Lipsitch again from Harvard.  That is corrosive to our ability to fight this pandemic and it is corrosive to public health in general.  And this is not the first time that this kind of thing has happened. Review that with us.  Yeah. You know it is just the latest in a series of situations where the White House has been at odds with the CDC and scientists at other federal agencies throughout the pandemic. You know President Trump - he is long kind of downplayed the seriousness of the pandemic. He is promoted treatments that did not necessarily have strong evidence. He is questioned the value of wearing masks. And just this week he directly contradicted the CDC director about how soon a vaccine might be widely available. Here's Joshua Sharfstein at Johns Hopkins again.  We are in the middle of a pandemic and we are approaching 200000 deaths right now. And there is just no question that it is hurting our ability to fight a pandemic. And the net result is that more people are getting sick and dying.  Yeah. So you know...  Rob can you give us - I am sorry. Go ahead.  Yeah. I was going to say you know there is a lot of you know hope that you know that we might start hearing more directly from some government scientists from more people like you know Tony Fauci at the NIH and Dr. Collins at the NIH and have - and there is been a lot of calls for regular briefings from the top officials at the CDC to really keep people abreast of where we are with the pandemic and giving clear strong advice about what people should be doing to try to get this pandemic finally under control.  Right and efforts to restore institutional credibility. That is NPR health correspondent Rob Stein. Thank you.  You bet.
