 Eleanor Beardsley has the story from UNESCO's home base in Paris.  Mark Richmond is UNESCO's global coordinator of HIVAIDS projects. He says there is a desperate need for better sex education in schools.  Only about 40 percent of young people between 15 and 24 have a clear and accurate understanding of how HIV and AIDS is transmitted. And that is appalling especially since 45 percent of all new infection are among young people between 15 and 24. And in that circumstance we really have to try to do something to improve the knowledge level and the awareness.  A draft copy of the guidelines placed on UNESCO's Web site prompted an outcry in some sections of the media. U.N. Report Advocates Teaching Masturbation to 5-year-olds was the headline on foxnews.com. New UNESCO Sex Education Guidelines Call on Children to Promote Abortions announced a lifenews.com article. Richmond calls such allegations false and a distortion of the facts to grab headlines. However he does admit the guidelines recommend starting sex education early.  It is no good teaching young people after they have started becoming sexually active. To have a comprehensive approach to this issue you cannot start teaching this at the age of 12. You need to be starting earlier letting children get a better understanding of things. It has to be obviously modulated according to their age.  Chad Hills is a sexual health analyst with the Christian group Focus on the Family. He says his group has a number of objections to the guidelines and not just about sex education for young children.  behavior.  The safest and healthiest context for sexuality is within a faithful monogamous heterosexual relationship called marriage that lasts a lifetime. When we undercut that message by handing out condoms and telling the lie that you can go out and have safe sex just wear a condom or just use birth control you know nothing could be further from the truth.
