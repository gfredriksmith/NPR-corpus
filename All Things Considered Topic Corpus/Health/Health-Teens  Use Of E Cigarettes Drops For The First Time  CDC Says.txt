 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is saying that for the first time fewer young people are using e-cigarettes. NPR health correspondent Rob Stein has the details.  E-cigarettes look a lot like regular cigarettes but instead of burning tobacco they heat up a liquid that contains nicotine producing a vapor that users inhale. And Brian King of the CDC says American kids went crazy for these things when they showed up in stores.  The increases that we saw in e-cigarette use among youth were simply unprecedented.  That sudden surge triggered widespread alarm among health experts. E-cigarettes are probably safer than regular cigarettes but no one really knows how much safer and nicotine is a powerful drug.  Nicotine's highly addictive and can also harm the developing adolescent brain.  So King says it is a huge relief to see what the latest statistics show. The number of middle and high school students vaping dropped from 3 million in 2015 to just under 2.2 million in 2016.  This is actually the first time that we have seen a decline in youth e-cigarette use since we started measuring this. So it is actually quite remarkable from a public health standpoint - 800000 fewer youth that are using a product within only a one-year period.  Now King does not know what caused the turnaround but he thinks it is probably a combination of factors - big public campaigns about the dangers of vaping bans on vaping in public places and selling e-cigarettes to minors. Whatever the reason anti-smoking advocates are thrilled.  This is good. This is very good.  Robin Koval heads the anti-smoking group called the Truth Initiative.  There is really no reason why we want to see a new generation finding new ways to use nicotine.  But Koval and King say it is too soon to know for sure whether things have really turned around for good and too many kids are still using e-cigarettes and smoking regular cigarettes.
