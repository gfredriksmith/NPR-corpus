 And now from the most macro of economic indicators to the most micro. Ms.  I am about to make the last payment on my 17000 of debt so that I will be out of credit card debt right now. Right now yeah.  That is Rachel Wilson talking with her friend and our producer Zoe Chace. You might remember Rachel. She was on this show a few months back just before Congress passed a credit card reform bill. Zoe checked in with her this week.  This was Rachel's life two years ago when she owed 17000 to about 20 different card companies. Ms.  I could not sleep at night and I just had this kind of constant anxiety about it. And I would say okay that is it. Like I am not going to you know spend anymore on my credit cards. One time I froze my credit cards with a block of ice so I could not use them.   In October of 2008 as the government bailed banks out of their bad debt Rachel started her own bailout program. She wrote down every single expense on her blog and she put a big chunk of her pay check towards her credit cards every month. When I visited her in April she was only 3000 away from being credit card debt-free.  Ms.  So I am logging into my account.  July 15th 2009 bank earnings are up stock market stabilizing and Rachel... Ms.  By selecting okay you are authorizing an electronic withdrawal to pay your credit cards. So I am going to click okay. And there we go. Yeah so now I am out of credit card debt.  So how do you feel man? Ms.  I am a little scared actually because now I have - I am supposed to start saving all of this money that I have been putting towards my credit cards. And it seems like it would be really easy to not do that. I can literally do anything I want which is terrifying.  That is a terrifying spot a lot of us would like to be in.  That is NPR's Zoe Chace.
