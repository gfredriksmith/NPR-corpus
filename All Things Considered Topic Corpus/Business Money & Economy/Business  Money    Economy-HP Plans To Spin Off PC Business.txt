 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Melissa Block.  I am Robert Siegel. And it is time now for All Tech Considered.   Well we are going to ask Ben Worthen of the Wall Street Journal. Welcome to the program.  Thank you for having me.  Ben it is tempting to see Hewlett-Packard's announcement as confirmation that the era of the personal computer is over. But HP is also talking about getting out of the tablet business and the smartphone business. What is going on here?  And as you noted Hewlett-Packard is getting out of those businesses too. They launched a short while ago their own types of products in those categories and they have not caught on. And so they are pulling the plug.  Hewlett-Packard has also just bought a British software company Autonomy for over 10 billion. Why? What is the plan there?  Software tends to be more profitable than computers. It is the sort of product that you can build it once write it once and then sell it over and over and over again. And moving forward I think we should expect HP to try to buy more software companies to expand its products there and to target businesses much more than it does consumers.  You know it is intriguing and a little humbling to look at the things that have come down in price that Hewlett-Packard makes for personal computers and printers. Something that does not come down in price is the ink inside those printer cartridges. And I gather it is a big business for them.  And they have no intention of getting out of that business even though you would think it would have a similar type of dynamic as the PC business. I think they are going to keep milking that cow for as long as they can.   Ink is good business.  Right.  Ben Worthen thanks so much for talking with us.  Thank you for having me.
