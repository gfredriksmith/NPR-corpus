 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Audie Cornish and it is time now for All Tech Considered.   Today is the World Wide Web's 21st birthday of the World Wide Web. Yes the Web is now fully legal. And here to help us raise a glass is NPR's Steve Henn. Hey there Steve.  Hi.  So this is not the Internet's birthday right? This is a little different?  That is right. The Internet is older than the World Wide Web. The Internet let us computers connect and ship data to each other. Or actually networks connect. It is like the Web's big brother and it began in the late '60s. The Web was born in 1991  URL's HTML and HTTP. And these made it easier to share information across all those connected computer systems.  We actually just heard this name recently at the London Olympics opening ceremony right. they had Sir Tim Berners-Lee on stage I think. But help me sort out this alphabet soup of acronyms .  OK So URLs provided the Web site addresses. HTML is really the language Web sites speak. And HTTP is the protocol - it is the grammar or the rules that sites use to communicate. So the Web began as a way for high energy physicists to share data. But back on August 6 1991  We are very interested in spreading the Web to other areas.  And it turned out that worked pretty well right?.  Yeah no kidding. Now we can use it to buy shoes post cat videos. And it is a standard grammar that allows people to publish document online cheaply. And if you think about it the Web has really transformed how information is collected and shared globally.  Now before we go Steve I hear it is your birthday today too right?  Yes that is right. I am turning 40.   But you know considering everything the Web has accomplished in just 21 years this makes me feel like a total slacker.   OK. Steve thanks so much. Happy Birthday.  Thank you.
