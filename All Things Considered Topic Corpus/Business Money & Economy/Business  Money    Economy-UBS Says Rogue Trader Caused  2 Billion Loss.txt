Yes one trader 2 billion. NPR's Philip Reeves picks up the story from London.  This is the stuff of every banker' A rogue trader has somehow lost a couple of billion dollars in unauthorized deals. That says Swiss banking giant UBS is what is just happened. The markets were still absorbing this stunning news as Commander Ian Dyson of the City of London Police made this announcement.  At 1 a.m. this morning the City of London Police were contacted by UBS about an allegation of fraud by one of their employees 30 a.m. detectives from our force arrested a 31-year-old man on suspicion of fraud by abuse of position.  Some analysts are wondering why after these two scandals plus the 2008 financial crisis it is still apparently possible for a rogue trader to cause havoc. What happened to risk control? Louise Cooper analyst for the financial firm BCG Partners thinks this case is not about that.  Risk control is increased substantially at banks. I just think it is one of these situations where you have a rogue person and if somebody wants to circumvent the rules I do not think there is much you can do about it if they are smart if they are motivated. It happens in all walks of life. It is in human nature to get around the rules.  Did Kweku Adoboli the UBS trader now under arrest try to get around the rules?
