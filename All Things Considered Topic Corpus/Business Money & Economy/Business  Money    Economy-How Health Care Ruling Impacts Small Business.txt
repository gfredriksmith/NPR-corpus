 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Throughout the health care debate the plight of small business owners has been a recurring theme. Their premiums are often much higher than those paid by big business. The Obama administration argues its health care legislation will lower their costs and expand options for coverage but opponents argue the opposite. Today's small business owners had mixed reactions as we hear from NPR's Wendy Kaufman.  Zachary Davis owner of the Penny Creamery a two-year-old make-it-from-scratch ice cream company in Santa Cruz California was heartened by today's ruling.  I feel like it offers us the best chance to be able to offer our employees affordable and quality health care.  But Betty Neighbors founder and president of the TERRA Staffing Group a recruiting and staffing firm in Everett Washington fears her company's health care costs could rise exponentially and Neighbors has a larger more fundamental concern too.  Clearly when the federal government can mandate that every American purchase something it is a very serious assault on our freedom and individual liberty.  Neighbors is an active member of the National Federation of Independent Business. The organization which represents primarily very small businesses was one of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit. And today the organization vowed to fight in Congress for a full repeal of the law. One of its provisions requires that businesses with 50 or more full-time employees or an equivalent number of part-timers provide health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty. Neighbors fears she might have to provide coverage for thousands of temporary workers she places in jobs.  So we are looking at going from maybe 100000 in premiums per year - what we are paying now - to well over a million.  She would try to pass on those costs but worries that clients will try to figure out a way to do without her services because they do not want to absorb those added costs. Frank Reardon the president of Becker Trucking based in Tukwila Washington also worries about costs. Right now he provides insurance for his 100 or so workers but the law calls for states to set minimum standards for coverage. And if he needs additional coverage he may have to pay more and that could mean fewer raises for his employees.  If it goes to medical it is going to have to come out of wages.  But Reardon also harbors a hope that premiums could actually decline under the law. He says with the individual mandate in place there will be fewer uninsured individuals that those with insurance end up paying for.  Maybe insurance costs are higher because we are doing that. If everybody has to contribute to the insurance programs will that bring the overall costs down or is the amount of regulation and reporting that is going to come with it is that going to neutralize that?  The trucking company president says we will just have to wait and see. But Jody Hall owner of Seattle-based Cupcake Royale says she is already seen some positive impact. Like many other small businesses Hall has seen her premiums rise 15 or 20 percent or more year after year.  This year because of health care reform our insurance went up only 5 percent. That is unprecedented.  Zachary Davis the Santa Cruz ice cream maker is also hopping for premium reductions but he is also looking at the long term. Most of his employees are young and now he says they will have insurance.  I think it is something that a lot of them could not have expected a couple of years ago and now they will. And we have a lot of interest and a lot of concern for their future and it is really going to mean a lot for them.  The Supreme Court has now clarified many things but as Davis and the others know there is an election in November and things could change. Wendy Kaufman NPR News.
