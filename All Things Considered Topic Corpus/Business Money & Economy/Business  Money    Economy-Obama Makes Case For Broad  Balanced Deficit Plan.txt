 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Robert Siegel.  Today in an interview with NPR President Obama made his case for a broad and balanced plan to cut the deficit. Mr. Obama said any compromise should include new revenues from an overhaul of the tax code as well as spending cuts. But he had this caveat.  I think what is absolutely true is is that core commitments that we make to the most vulnerable have to be maintained. And so a lot of the spending cuts that we are making should be around areas like defense spending as opposed to food stamps.  And here's what the president said when asked why the deficit negotiations have been so difficult.  I think that there is some politics and you know compromising with me among some Republican leaders is bad politics for them. I also think that in fairness that the decisions we have got to make right not are tough ones and nobody likes them.  You can hear more of Michele Martin's interview with President Obama tomorrow on NPR's TELL ME MORE and also at NPR.org.
