 As the back and forth over the debt ceiling continues here in Washington we went out into the country to talk with some nonpoliticians. We wanted to hear what you think Congress should do now.  I think we need to cut spending. And I am on Medicare and I am on Social Security. I mean I realize I am talking about cutting my own checks but it has to be done to save the country I think.  I would like to see senators the Congress not be paid until they can work this thing out.  If they would think more about jobs the debt would take care of itself.  I am hoping this crisis will facilitate our withdrawal from wars that have been - are failures.  There has to be compromise. My home budget my husband and I get to compromise on oh I think we need to spend money here. He is like well I think we need - so there is only so many dollars. We have to come to an agreement.  What would happen if you and your husband acted like Congress?   We would be divorced.   That was Tammy Brancamp of Reno Nevada Steven Maley of Helena Montana Carol Murphy of Springfield Missouri Michael Anmarkowitz of Irondale Alabama and David Jones of Springfield Missouri all with their advice to Congress.
