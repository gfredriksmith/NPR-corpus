 This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I am Michele Norris.  NPR's Brian Naylor reports.  Mark Umbrell's son an Army ranger was killed in Iraq in 2007.  I thought we were going to get a check from the government for 400000. And when I read into this I remember my wife and I having a conversation that this is a scam this insurance company or this bank they are stealing money.  Stories like these outrage people like Joe Davis with the Veterans of Foreign Wars in Washington.  To make money off of dead soldiers you do not do that. That is just not right. And just because they are doing this to all beneficiaries across the nation does not make it any less egregious.  Paul Graham is a senior vice president with the American Council of Life Insurers the industry's trade group.  We have had positive feedback from beneficiaries that have liked these accounts but we certainly are open to reviewing any problems that have occurred.  Brian Naylor NPR News.
