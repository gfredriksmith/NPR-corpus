 President Obama talked about the new jobs numbers today. He characterized the loss of another quarter million jobs as something of a success story.  Today we are pointed in the right direction. We are losing jobs at less than half the rate we were when I took office. We have pulled the financial system back from the brink and a rising market is restoring value to those 401Ks that are the foundation of a secure retirement.  The economy has lost 6.7 million jobs since the slide began a year and half ago. So far it is hard to know how to balance that against the presidents pledge to create or save 3.5 million jobs by the year 2011. Today the president said the worst may be behind us but he made clear the crisis is not over yet. Pres.  We have to consider what comes next because we cannot afford to return to an economy based on inflated profits and maxed out credit cards an economy where we depend dirty and outdated sources of energy an economy where we are burdened by soaring health care costs that serve only the special interests. This will not create sustainable growth. It will not shrink our deficit. And it will not create jobs.  That is President Obama today in the White House Rose Garden. He did not take any questions.
