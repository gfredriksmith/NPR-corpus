 With news that America's oldest department store chain is getting sold to the 7-year-old startup Le Tote. NPR's Alina Selyukh reports.  Lord  Taylor is almost 200 years old. It gets credit for a lot of firsts in retail - the first female company president in the 1940s first personal shoppers in the '50s a dog boutique with mink-lined coats for pets in the '60s. It claims to have invented the department store window display blowing bleached cornflakes for a Christmas mood during a warm winter in the late '30s. But then came this last Christmas window display...   ...At the Lord  Taylor flagship in Manhattan. The retailer closed its Fifth Avenue store in January. The iconic building was sold and now Lord  Taylor itself faces the same fate. Here's Rakesh Tondon CEO of Le Tote.  We are definitely a startup and we are taking the oldest retailer and making it into a startup as well.  Le Tote is an online subscription service where you can rent nice clothes. Tondon says they have long wanted to have a physical footprint a place where people could pick up and drop off their rentals maybe rent heavy items like jackets or buy extra accessories. For 100 million Le Tote will take over 38 Lord  Taylor locations.  So their customers are very similar to our customers. There is a very big overlap.  This is the latest example of a venerable department store trying to stay afloat. JC Penney and Macy's are dipping into used clothing sales. Barneys New York has declared bankruptcy Sears just came out of one. Lord  Taylor's current owner Canada's Hudson's Bay Company plans to keep the real estate but will sell the Lord  Taylor brand to Le Tote. Tondon says he does not plan any layoffs.
