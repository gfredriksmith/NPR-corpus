 From NPR News this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I am Melissa Block.  A lot of the money that the federal government poured into its bank rescue program probably ended up overseas. That is the conclusion of a report issued today by a congressional panel overseeing the Troubled Asset Relief Program or TARP. It says the government needs to do a better job tracking funds flowing to foreign banks. More now from NPR's Jim Zarroli.  Warren says many of these had significant ties to foreign investors and when the U.S. government gave them money much of it essentially flowed overseas.  The result appears to be that America's rescue had a much greater impact on other nations than their rescue programs had on the United States.  Still she says the U.S. needs to do a better job tracking where its rescue money goes.  If the U.S. had gathered more information about the flow of rescue funds it could have asked other countries to share the pain.  Jim Zarroli NPR News New York.
