 Tonight Jon Stewart is saying goodbye as host of The Daily Show. He aimed his satire at many politicians and public figures and as NPR's Jason Margolis reports at least one well-known company.  Jon Stewart had his favorite targets to skewer - George W. Bush Donald Trump and the fast food chain Arby's.   Arby's.   Is not there anywhere else we can eat? Arby's. Arby's. Arby's. With sliced something. Technically it is food.  That compilation was actually part of an Arby's commercial that aired during Stewart's show last night. Chris Fuller with Arby's says they are not afraid to be part of the joke.  It is really no different than two college buddies. They will say the meanest nastiest things about each other and joke in the most awful way possible but at the end of the day they want to be in each other's wedding.  But he is making fun of your product saying hey if you eat Arby's  it is really not good for you. Are you calling attention to this with the commercial?  I do not think so. I think we are punctuating it with having some fun and showing that it is all done in a convivial spirit.  Arby's is doubling down on this strategy - they have also created a corned beef sandwich in Stewart's honor. Jason Margolis NPR News.
