 Now one note on that stale pizza Congressman Flake just mentioned. Last night according to the Washington Post no fewer than 40 pizzas were delivered to GOP offices for private coercion sessions. Unlike the U.S. government Al's Gourmet Pizza is in no danger of default. Fourteen blocks away from the Capitol building employee Abdul Mohammed was inundated with orders for pizza at lunchtime today many bound for Congress.  Busy customer right now the Congress. They all over me. Right now they gonna keep calling. I am very very busy right now.  Very busy. So busy that that is all Mohammed had time to say. He was busy hammering pizza dough into shape.   Busy but happy.
