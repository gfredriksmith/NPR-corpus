 During recessions like the one we are in now economists and business reporters look at a lot of different indicators to determine the overall health of the economy.  Indicators like consumer confidence durable goods purchases and until now the lipstick index...  That term the lipstick index was coined by someone who knows lipstick. Leonard Lauder is the son of Estee Lauder founder of the makeup company. He came up with the lipstick index during the economic downturn after 911. Here's how Kelly Dobos explains it. She is a cosmetic chemist in Cincinnati.  That women were still going to buy themselves a little pick-me-up even during a downturn in an economic cycle because it is relatively inexpensive and it is a nice treat for themselves.  In other words when the economy goes down lipstick sales go up. But like so much else in the world the coronavirus has turned the lipstick index on its head - the reason being masks. Speaking from experience masks and lipstick just do not mix. I have already stained a bunch of my masks Ari. So why am I even bothering with lipstick?  I wish I could say I feel your pain but I have not had that problem.  .  Jennifer Spaulding Schmidt is senior partner at McKinsey  Company.  What we see now obviously with masks is that people are not buying lipstick.  But people are still looking for inexpensive ways to treat themselves.  What they are buying is nail care nail polish to do their own nails. They are buying skin care products.  So kiss the lipstick index goodbye and say hello to a new economic indicator.  I think we are seeing the new nail index.
