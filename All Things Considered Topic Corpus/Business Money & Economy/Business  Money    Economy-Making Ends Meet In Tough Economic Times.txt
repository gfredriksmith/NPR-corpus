 We checked in with some unemployment offices today in California and Tennessee to find out how a few jobless Americans are coping. Ms.  I am Kata Bradley. I am from Nashville. I do not have cable. I no longer buy books. I photographed a couple of weddings.  Ms.  I am just making up things as I go along anything I can do to make some extra money but it is hard because I am not making ends meet. Ms.  My name is Lola Herring and I live in Los Angeles. We are struggling as it is you know trying to buy food pay rent car notes bills. Mr.  My name is Michael Hickman. I am from Springfield Tennessee. And when creditors call and you are late on a payment do you try to make arrangements you know explain to them well you know I just got laid off and unemployment only goes so far? Mr.  Hi my name is Bermdeith Bal and I am living in North Sacramento. It is hard. It is tough. I am using my savings to make ends meet. I hope they pass it so we can get some money pay our bills and stuff. Ms.  My name is Sandra Maryland like the state dash Crissy and I am from Antioch Tennessee. I mean you got to cut back. You just got about - hopefully you get the pig fat on the meat for 20 and then you get can goods to go along. And then you make a meal for two or three days where you will make a meal for one day make it for two or three days.  Just few voices from unemployment centers in Sacramento Los Angeles and Nashville today.
