 In what could be a troubling sign for the U.S. economy manufacturing activity started contracting last month. U.S. manufacturing has been a much-needed bright spot with companies adding jobs and selling more products. But today as NPR's Chris Arnold tells us we got evidence that things might be changing.  This so-called ISM Index showed that manufacturing has been shrinking for the first time in three years. That definitely does not sound good. Brian Bethune is an economist with Gordon College in Massachusetts.  Clearly the weakness that we saw in manufacturing in June is somewhat of a disappointment.  Still when you dig into the numbers  new orders for manufacturing fell very sharply. In fact orders have not dropped off this much since all the way back in 2001 right after the September 11th attacks. Back then many companies of course put a lot of projects on hold. But why would they be holding back so much right now? Brad Holcomb heads up the survey.  You know I have been asked that all day long. And I do not think I can point to anything in particular at all.  There is speculation that the ongoing trouble in Europe could be part of the problem. But Holcomb says in other parts of this month's survey there are also positive signs. Most manufacturers for example they say they are still adding jobs.  They are still hiring. And another piece of good news is that the prices index dropped 10.5 points.  That means for the second month in a row manufacturers say that they are getting a break from the falling cost of more raw materials basically it is cheaper for them to make stuff. Meanwhile in the broader economy some sectors such as construction are actually doing better. Other indicators like consumer confidence look shakier. And overall most economists are forecasting more of the same an ongoing economic recovery but a very slow. Chris Arnold NPR News.
