 You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. Is there any such thing as too much lobster? Maybe not if you love to eat it. But if you depend on catching lobsters for a living you might feel differently. This summer is shaping up to be a record season for lobster landings in Maine. And for the state's 5000 lobster men that means trouble. Tom Porter of Maine Public Broadcasting explains.   On Portland's waterfront about five lobster boats are tied up at one of the piers. Half a dozen lobstermen stand around discussing the current problem of oversupply. Willis Spear says he is rarely seen a more desperate situation for Maine's lobster catchers and he is been at it for 47 years man and boy. With prices where they are he says this is a good chance to stay off the water and catch up on other stuff.  The price is so low that we are really not making a living so I am just going to attend to the business at the house until we see an increase in price.  This lobster glut is due to the earlier-than-usual appearance of soft-shelled lobsters a factor which many attribute to warmer ocean temperatures. These softer creatures do not ship well live so they are either consumed locally or sent to processing plants on the East Coast where their meat is stripped to go in lobster products like chowder. This unexpected glut however means the lobster pounds and processing plants have a huge backlog to clear. The result is that lobstermen like Willis Spear are being paid nearly half the amount they were getting just a few years ago. He says the current boat price is about 2.50 a pound.  Which is not worth going out for. So I would love to see 3 and that would be still pretty low for you know for the expenses we have now.  Spear says due to the price of bait fuel and labor it costs him nearly 500 a day just to check his traps. He has 800 of them. It is a predicament which has prompted lobstermen along much of the Maine coast to tie up their boats until prices improve. Many of them have contacted Maine's Department of Marine Resources asking that they close down the fishery. The state however does not have the authority to do this. While lobstermen wring their hands consumers are making the most of the low prices.   At a busy intersection in South Portland Maine native Barbara McFarlane parks her car and heads for an early lunch at Dock's Seafood restaurant and market.  We just love lobster. We are Mainers and usually we cannot afford it.   It is grand to be able to afford it this year.  McFarlane is eyeing a twin lobster dinner for just under 16. Restaurant owner Bob Coppersmith says last summer that same meal could have cost nearly 30. The current lobster glut he says is bringing in about 300 customers a day not bad for a 75-seat establishment.  It is unbelievable. The business has been really going strong. Everybody wants lobsters because they are at a good price. Some people are coming in a couple of times a day.  If you want to make the most of Maine's cheap lobsters the sooner you come here the better. Experts say they have never seen soft-shelled lobsters this early in the season and they do not how much longer they will be around. For NPR News I am Tom Porter in Portland Maine.
