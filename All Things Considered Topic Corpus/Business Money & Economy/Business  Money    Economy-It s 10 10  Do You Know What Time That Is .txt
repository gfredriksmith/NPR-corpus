 It is been about two weeks since Apple announced it was entering the watch industry. CEO Tim Cook slyly unveiled the new Apple Watch.   We have one more thing.   And while others pick apart the new watch's features we were intrigued by something we read on the news website Quartz about the design of the ads. Say you open a magazine and you see a glossy picture of this new watch. 09 and that is no random time. Apple is joining a long history of watch ad design.  Well usually it'09 10 11. But it'10 - you know those numbers and it is been always like this for a hundred years basically.  That is Giorgio Galli. He is design director for Timex. Rolex does it too. So do Fossil Citizen Bell and Ross Omega but why?  Well Galli says it is about symmetry. 10 on a clock. The hour and minute hands form a wide V. Some say watches are set this way in ads because it looks like a smiley face. But Galli says...  No. For me it is just the best way to see the entire look of the dial in the best way. So it is not really a smiley face.  So it is not really a smiley face Galli says. He has been in the watch design business for more than 20 years. And even before he knew about the industry standard 09 is the time he drew.  It actually came naturally. When - the first time I designed a dial I positioned the hand in that position just even without knowing that it is supposed to be in that position.  And that intuitive design Galli says has become watch advertising tradition.  The watch industry is made out of small details you know. So every detail really counts a lot.  Right down to the second.
