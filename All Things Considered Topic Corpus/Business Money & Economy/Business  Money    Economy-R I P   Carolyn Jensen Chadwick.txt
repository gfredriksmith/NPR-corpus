 Finally this hour we remember a former colleague. One of NPR's very first employees died yesterday. Producer Carolyn Jensen was 65. NPR hired her in 1970 to set up its research library before any program was ever broadcast. Years later as a producer Carolyn established and maintained a partnership between NPR and National Geographic. Her job was to make radio stories with sound as vivid as the photographs in the magazine and she did it. Her program Radio Expeditions took her and reporters around the world to create long-form acoustically rich stories radio that is hard to excerpt and do justice to but here's a small sample.   The first night of the hunt hands that carried guns all day picked up guitars. A dozen people sat around the fire and ate the dense flavorful meat from an elk killed the previous year.  When you come to a tropical rainforest most people would think that your very first priority is above all avoid any contact with insects.   Those are treehoppers.  You have horses swim here and we saw one swim earlier today and was that interval training?  Well they swim more than one session yes.   It is great for the horses because you can work them without getting on their backs. Ms.  Consciousness comes from purity and purity comes from our habits also so we have to make our lifestyle pure.   Some examples of audio from productions by Carolyn Jensen. Ten years ago Carolyn was diagnosed with multiple myeloma. That is a rare cancer of blood plasma. Her life expectancy then was just three years. She received care at the Myeloma Institute for Research and Therapy in Little Rock Arkansas where she died yesterday. Her friends and former colleagues at NPR will miss her. As her husband and former NPR host Alex Chadwick reminded us today Carolyn Jensen is not just part of NPR's heritage she helped create it.   You are listening to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News.
