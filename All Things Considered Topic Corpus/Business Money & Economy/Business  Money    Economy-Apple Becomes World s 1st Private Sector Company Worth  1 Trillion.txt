 OK Apple has become the first private sector company to be worth a trillion dollars. That is after its share price hit an all-time high today. Reporter Ryan Kailath has the story now that he is worked out exactly how many zeroes are in 1 trillion.  Twelve zeros as it happens. You need four commas for a trillion dollars. Apple hit the figure when its share price jumped more than 8 percent this week. That is after the company reported strong quarterly earnings driven mostly by iPhone sales. The trillion and change is actually Apple's market capitalization. That is what you get when you multiply the number of shares by the share price. It is a historic moment and the talking heads are talking.   But yes we officially hit it. We officially made history today. Apple did.   Apple just hit a trillion dollars in market value.   For the first time in history a company is worth 1 trillion.  So big deal - super meaningful right?  Kind of unimportant.  Kim Forrest is a portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital and she says the number's largely symbolic. Apple does not unlock any new capitalist superpowers now that it is crossed the threshold. It just sounds cool. If anything it means the company can borrow more money if it wants. Forrest likens it to well being rich.  The bigger your house the more you can borrow against it because the lender thinks that your house is going to be worth more tomorrow than it is today.  Some investors think this is actually a bad thing a sign that Apple's stock is overvalued. Forrest says maybe but she adds Apple's got revenue on the books to back up its high valuation unlike some of its fancy tech sector peers. Some of those peers are likely to join Apple in the four-comma club. Amazon's close. But in the history books you rarely learn who came in second. For NPR News I am Ryan Kailath.
