 Now we are going to meet a young entrepreneur.  My name is John Potter and I have been using Airbnb to rent out my tent in the backyard.  That is right. He is renting out a tent on Airbnb. This is in Mountain View Calif. - Silicon Valley. But technically it is not his backyard it is his parents'.  I put the listing up about a week and a half ago.  Potter a 22-year-old Web developer said it all started as a joke - until the booking requests started coming in.  I would say it is split pretty evenly between vacationers and tech-y people.  Tech-y people who get a new job for instance and need a cheap place to stay.  Cheap is relative. To live in Potter's parents' backyard in a tent it will cost you 46 a night or 960 a month.  But it is Silicon Valley - a single room can be in the 1500 range and hey you may luck into a free meal.  We will give you food if we happen to be cooking - no guarantee. You get Wi-Fi electricity to charge your laptop with an extension cord.  Also the tent features a sleeping bag and a crate for your clothes and Potter and his parents will let you in the house for a shower once a day.  Good. Potter says booking inquiries are steady.  I have already gotten a couple this morning and the day is not over.  Since the listing's gone up he is had two people rent the tent. User Dan from Massachusetts wrote on Airbnb that he loved his stay.  He said quote the room is great and the location is better. He also enjoyed meeting the Potter family - bonus.
